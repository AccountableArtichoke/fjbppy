Summary: The speakers are developing a cryptocurrency app called FJB (standing for both "Fuck Joe Biden" and "Freedom, Jobs, and Business") scheduled for March release that will enable merchants to accept payments and serve as a multi-currency wallet with FJB as the primary token.

Summary: The FJB app launch scheduled for March 16th was delayed due to ongoing testing of the off-ramp/selling functionality and complications from one developer being in Kiev, Ukraine during the war, though the team assured delays would be minimal. Despite missing the deadline, the speaker emphasized the team's commitment with endorsers like Boris, Bannon, Bernie Carrick and Ryan still actively involved, while web traffic remained extremely high with people constantly refreshing the website in anticipation.

Summary: The speaker apologizes for lacking transparency and promises renewed "day one energy" while confirming the FJB app will launch "within the week" (next seven days) despite ongoing bug fixes, with one developer working from war-torn Kiev, Ukraine. The team rejected an $850,000 listing fee from KuCoin exchange to instead build an American-made app that will serve as a bridge to bring Trump's 74 million voters into crypto through an all-in-one marketplace featuring NFTs, conservative retailers like MyPillow, and a 1% burn mechanism on app purchases.

Summary: The app launch attracted 4,500 new users with projections of tens of thousands by day's end before a third-party API provider shut down the cash-to-crypto conversion service after their compliance team raised concerns about Steve Bannon's involvement with the project. The development team estimates it will take one week to rebuild the API functionality in-house to prevent future deplatforming, with all user funds remaining safe and accessible through alternative withdrawal methods.

Eric Finman predicts FJB coin will perform well during what he anticipates will be continued market downturns under Biden's economic policies, positioning the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation similar to how Bitcoin originally functioned for libertarian investors during the 2008 financial crisis.

Users must immediately withdraw their coins from LBank and XT exchanges due to imminent delisting and low volume, with no significant fees expected during the process, and the team remains on track for a November go-live on key tasks ahead of the planned TPUSA event in mid-December.

Summary: Testing instructions for PPY will be released over the weekend with a 5,000 PPY per buy limit ($2 worth), allowing community members to test through wallets like TrustWallet and MetaMask before full trading is enabled with 24-hour notice. The anti-bot system will tax traders who sell within a customizable timeframe after buying (potentially 12-24 hours), with double the standard 8% tax rate to prevent sandwich bot attacks that previously affected FJB holders.

Summary: The project's app deployment for testing is expected this week with API issues being resolved, while users must immediately transfer their coins off LBank and XT exchanges as both are delisting the cryptocurrency due to low volume. The team expects to complete phase 4 development by Monday ahead of the Thanksgiving deadline, positioning them to potentially secure a booth at TPUSA's December 16-19 event which has over 15,000 registered attendees.

Summary: The team is waiting on a third-party vendor who requested two more days to complete their portion of the task, with testing potentially available by month-end despite uncertainty about meeting the December 5th deadline for TPUSA. Over 2,000 wallets containing hundreds of millions of coins remain on XT and LBank exchanges which are delisting the cryptocurrency, with some individual wallets holding over $10,000 worth that will be lost if not transferred immediately.

Summary: Third party vendors have reached the 24-hour notice threshold where they only need 24 hours to complete their remaining work once given permission to proceed. Security professionals discovered two vulnerabilities in the app including one from November 2022, which the team is addressing before going live, making TPUSA attendance with the app unlikely though going live this week remains possible.

Summary: The team expects to complete liquidity pool pairing and begin internal testing of the PPY (Patriot Pay) contract within 24-48 hours, followed by community testing with transactions limited to 8,000 PPY before full trading is enabled with 24-hour advance notice. The airdrop snapshot has been taken for FJB holders who had coins in DEX wallets, while those with coins still on centralized exchanges LBANK and XT are advised to sell their FJB and wait to buy PPY since their exchange wallets were not included in the snapshot.

Summary: The team is awaiting completion of an API component from their advisor to begin internal testing of the PPY contract, which is expected to take 2-3 days followed by community testing before airdrops can occur and trading is enabled. Testing has been delayed for three days due to an app-related deliverable from Velo who has gone missing, forcing the team to proceed with their advisor handling the implementation instead.

Summary: The dev working on the new on-ramp integration remains on track to complete their portion by Tuesday, though the third-party vendor's processing may extend beyond that date, while the white paper is still scheduled for release by end of week. The team continues interviewing developers to accelerate app completion, with War Room marketing ruled out for March or April since multiple lower-volume marketing campaigns must first be conducted to stress-test the app and ensure it can handle high-volume wallet creation before the major push.

Summary: The team has multiple app deployments ready to push sequentially, starting with PatriotPay integration testing expected within a week, followed by a new wallet creation system from a tier-one company (used by Disney and Nike) that will require users to create new accounts since existing seed phrases cannot be imported into the new system initially. The white paper's reflection mechanism has been clarified to involve a separate companion coin that earns PPY as reflections, rather than direct PPY reflections, while a new transfer integration will allow users to manage external exchange holdings directly within the app without visiting third-party sites.

Summary: Developers have committed to delivering outstanding app work by Monday, while Apple's verification process is progressing with an expected call within 24-48 hours followed by 5-7 business days for LLC verification before the App Store name change can proceed. The Replatform Payments conference sponsored by GapPay is yielding promising connections, including discussions with a physician interested in accepting PPY who is also engaged in a lawsuit against the FDA, and conversations with Bitcoin Magazine representatives for potential collaboration.

Summary: The Apple App Store verification is now progressing correctly after a previous representative provided incorrect instructions, with the verification partner estimating completion between April 1st and April 23rd, though it often resolves sooner. Developers believe the current app issues may be related to ChangeNow and are working with them to resolve it, while the team has found and tested an alternative to Vess for the new login and wallet creation system, with early discussions targeting Q3 2024 for a proprietary on-ramp solution to increase self-sufficiency.

Summary: Significant progress has been made on the app in the past 24-48 hours, though development is currently stalled waiting on a partner to resolve an error affecting both smart wallet and expert wallet functionality, which the dev has identified as originating from the partner's side. The educational video series is progressing well with two videos completed out of 15 planned, starting with cryptocurrency basics for newcomers, while the team remains on track to complete Q1 roadmap items including the marketplace integration that was prioritized due to merchant interest.

Summary: The team is currently blocked by a ChangeNow API issue affecting swap functionality in the app, which must be resolved before users can transfer funds out of smart wallets—a prerequisite for deploying the already-completed new authentication and wallet generation service, followed by the on-ramp integration. The roadmap has been reorganized to prioritize marketplace functionality over Patriot Perks this quarter due to merchant demand, while Apple's verification partner has approved all submitted documents with final verification expected soon to enable App Store name searchability.

Summary: Apple's verification system is complete with App Store listing updates expected within 24 hours, marking a major milestone required before marketing can begin since both Apple and Google Play stores will then show PatriotPay as searchable. The primary remaining blocker is the ChangeNow API issue, which once resolved will enable sequential deployment of the new login/wallet generation service and on-ramp integration, with users needing to transfer funds out of smart wallets (tax reimbursed) before the new authentication system goes live.

Summary: ChangeNow fixed their API issue overnight, and the developer is now working to get the app ready for community testing potentially by the end of the weekend, which will enable users to transfer funds out of smart wallets before the new login/wallet generation service is deployed. Apple App Store submission has been completed under the new developer account following the name change, with Google Play Store updates already live, clearing the path for marketing to begin once the app is functional and tested through sequential deployments of the authentication service, on-ramp integration, education page, and marketplace.

Summary: Apple App Store listing is now live as PatriotPay alongside the already-updated Google Play Store, completing a critical prerequisite for marketing to begin once the app is functional. The ChangeNow API fix is confirmed working, but the smart wallet is still throwing internal server errors related to gas estimation that the dev aims to resolve this week, after which users will have approximately two days to transfer funds out of smart wallets before the new login/wallet generation service and on-ramp integration are deployed sequentially for community testing.

Summary: The Smart Wallet is now functioning after being fixed Wednesday night, but deployment is pending further testing to resolve a double-tax and gas calculation issue before users are asked to move funds and begin broader marketing. The team plans a phased rollout starting with controlled user testing and light marketing to avoid past launch failures, with additional features like on-ramp services and political donations to follow once the new wallet login system is stable.

Summary: The team must modify the smart contract to eliminate an unintended additional ~8% operator wallet charge causing double taxation in the Smart Wallet, delaying community testing until a permanent fix is implemented. They also plan to remove USDT and USDC on Ethereum from the Smart Wallet due to high gas fees and user confusion, shifting stablecoin support to Polygon while reimbursing users for taxes incurred when transferring from the old Smart Wallet.

Summary: The double-tax issue in the Smart Wallet has been successfully resolved, and the only remaining blocker before deployment is fixing failed USDT/stablecoin transfers so users can move funds out of existing Smart Wallets. Following that fix, the team plans a phased rollout including a new wallet generation system, on-ramp integration, and later marketplace and education features, prioritizing long-term stability over speed and reaffirming the strategic shift from BNB to Polygon.

Summary: Users are urgently instructed to transfer all assets, including PPY and stablecoins, out of their Smart Wallets by the end of the weekend to avoid complications before the new wallet creation service is deployed, with only limited backend recovery options available for stragglers. The team is finalizing a contract to activate the new account and wallet creation service next week, after which phased testing will continue with the new on-ramp integration and gradual marketing to prevent prior launch issues.

Summary: Deployment of the new login and wallet creation system is delayed due to additional security changes required when switching from VES after recent Magic updates, though the contract is signed and an additional developer has been brought on to accelerate completion. The team hired a conservative PR firm and initiated approximately 21 new marketing contracts, planning a phased promotional rollout once testing is complete to avoid prior launch issues and ensure the app functions smoothly before a larger push.

Summary: Community testing of the newly deployed app version has officially begun, featuring Polygon-based stablecoins, a simplified email-based wallet creation system, and upgraded security, with users instructed to create entirely new accounts and report bugs via the provided templates. The old VESS-based wallets will not carry over balances, no seed phrase is currently available for the new wallets (private key export coming later), and users must ensure prior funds were moved and seed phrases saved, as access to legacy wallets will not be recoverable after the transition.

Summary: Developers are actively fixing a smart contract-related bug affecting certain Matic-to-PPY swaps while the new OnRamper integration is now live in the app, with limited testing ongoing and political donations set as the next major feature once transaction stability is confirmed. Users who failed to save their old wallet seed phrases will permanently lose access to those funds, as the non-custodial VESS-based accounts cannot be recovered, and new Magic-based wallets rely on secure email access with additional key export functionality still pending.

Summary: The team has resolved roughly 80% of known app bugs, with most swap issues now fixed, though intermittent ChangeNOW-related transaction errors and certain on-ramp verification display issues remain under active development. Users are urgently reminded to secure their old wallet seed phrases before VESS access is permanently removed, as unrecoverable funds cannot be restored, and further stress testing will begin once remaining transaction errors are stabilized before any marketing push.

Summary: The development team is actively working on critical bug fixes including transaction failures when users attempt purchases over change limits and a wallet address entry issue with onRamper that forces manual entry and disrupts the user flow, particularly impacting first-time crypto users. The company has more than tripled its user base since beginning influencer marketing campaigns, though management recognizes a fundamental disconnect where their target audience of non-crypto users struggles to grasp basic cryptocurrency concepts, necessitating even more simplified educational content than originally planned.

Summary: The development team is testing the escrow function for marketplace transactions after making security modifications to protect user privacy, with all current marketplace listings temporarily removed for the implementation.

Summary: The escrow function for marketplace transactions has been completed and deployed, protecting buyers and sellers by holding funds until delivery confirmation, while the direct on-ramp integration agreement has been signed with implementation expected much sooner than originally planned.

Summary: The OnRamper wallet address auto-populate bug has been identified as a timing issue and the fix should be completed by Thursday, clearing the way for August marketing campaigns across email lists reaching several million people, news networks at Trump rallies, and podcasts. A critical user error was discovered where sending MATIC to Smart Wallet PPY addresses instead of Expert Wallet MATIC addresses causes funds to appear on blockchain but not in the wallet, prompting the development team to prioritize a recovery solution sooner than originally planned.
