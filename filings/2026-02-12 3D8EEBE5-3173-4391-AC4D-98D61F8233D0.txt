Plaintiff Andrew Barr (“Plaintiff”), individually and on behalf of all others similarly
situated (the “Class”), brings this class action lawsuit against Defendants Stephen Bannon, Boris
Epshteyn, Sarah Abdul, Grant Tragni (collectively, the “Executive Defendants”), Let’s Go
Brandon Coin, LLC, Patriot Pay, LLC, Warroom LLC, 354 Nod Hill LLC, and TWinds LLC (the
“Entity Defendants,” and together with the Executive Defendants, “Defendants”). Plaintiff’s
allegations are based on personal knowledge as to himself and his own acts, and upon information
and belief as to all other matters, based on the investigation conducted by and through Plaintiff’s
undersigned counsel, which included, without limitation: review and analysis of press releases,
news articles, websites, state corporate filings, and other publicly available information concerning
Defendants and the cryptocurrency known as Let’s Go Brandon Coin, and later Patriot Pay.
INTRODUCTION
1.

This action arises from the unregistered offer and sale of a cryptocurrency to retail
investors by Defendants Steve Bannon and Boris Epshteyn, who leveraged their prominence,
credibility, and loyal following to market a digital token as a stable, secure, and functional
alternative to traditional currency—while concealing material facts about the token’s true risks,
governance, and economics.
2.

From late 2021 through early 2025, Defendants promoted a digital token initially
branded as Let’s Go Brandon Coin (“FJB” or “$FJB”) and later rebranded as Patriot Pay (“PPY”
or “$PPY”) (the “Token”) as a serious financial project with real-world utility, charitable purpose,
and resilience against inflation, debanking, and financial censorship. Defendants repeatedly
emphasized that the Token was not a meme coin or speculative novelty, but a decentralized
payment ecosystem that would protect users from economic instability and institutional control.

1
Case 1:26-cv-00452
3.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 8 of 106
Defendants deliberately targeted a politically aligned and deeply loyal audience—
individuals who trusted Defendants’ judgment, motives, and commitment to shared values—and
encouraged them to invest in the Token as a means of participating in a broader movement.
Defendants’ conduct was particularly insidious because it exploited that trust to induce purchases
of an unregistered, highly speculative asset under the guise of financial independence and
community membership.
4.

Central to Defendants’ pitch was the representation—explicit and implicit—that
Bannon and Epshteyn had entered into a strategic partnership with the project’s founders and
would lend their support and influence to help the Token succeed. Defendants repeatedly framed
their role as that of partners or advocates, rather than as controlling insiders.
5.

In reality, Defendants owned and controlled the project. Through a private,
undisclosed transaction, Defendants acquired governance and administrative control of the Token
without paying any purchase price, while investors—through embedded transaction fees—
effectively financed Defendants’ acquisition. Defendants did not disclose that purchasers of the
Token were, in substance, funding the very transaction that placed Defendants in control.
6.

Defendants further failed to disclose that the Token was centrally controlled; that
insiders retained authority over the Token’s smart contract and wallets; that Defendants could and
did freeze investor wallets; that select purchasers were offered over-the-counter (“OTC”) sales
outside public markets; and that transaction-based “marketing” and “charity” fees were not used
exclusively—or transparently—for the purposes investors were led to believe.
7.

Defendants also misrepresented the Token as decentralized, “uncancellable,” and
immune from the types of account freezes and restrictions imposed by traditional financial
institutions. In reality, Defendants retained—and exercised—centralized authority to restrict
2
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 9 of 106
trading, manage supply, and control liquidity, while exempting insider wallets from those same
constraints.
8.

Throughout the Class Period, Defendants promoted the Token as a safer alternative
to fiat currency, invoking economic collapse, inflation, and financial crisis to create urgency and
induce purchases. Defendants warned that the existing financial system was “hurtling towards”
catastrophe and represented that participation in the Token was necessary to preserve value,
transact freely, and maintain economic sovereignty.
9.

At the same time, Defendants failed to build any functioning payment ecosystem,
failed to deliver the promised utility, and devoted minimal and declining effort to promoting or
developing the project—despite repeatedly reassuring investors that they remained committed and
would double down.
10.

When investors raised concerns about missing funds, liquidity, and price collapse,
Defendants responded with reassurances and delay, including statements that “investigation is
ongoing” and “[i]t’s definitely not getting brushed under the rug,” while continuing to conceal
material information about insider control, fee usage, and preferential sales practices.
11.

In February 2025, Defendants abruptly disabled trading of the Token, announced
the project’s closure, and promised a liquidity distribution that never occurred—leaving investors
holding illiquid tokens after years of reliance on Defendants’ misleading statements.
12.

Registration would have required Defendants to disclose ownership, insider
compensation, fee arrangements, wallet control, conflicts of interest, and risk factors—information
Defendants instead concealed while continuing to solicit retail investors.
13.

Having used their prominence and credibility to induce loyal followers to purchase
an unregistered and misleadingly marketed digital asset—while concealing its true governance,
3
Case 1:26-cv-00452

Filed 02/12/26
Page 10 of 106
risks, and economics—Defendants can no longer evade accountability. The securities laws exist
precisely to prevent influential insiders from exploiting trust, obscuring material facts, and shifting
risk onto retail investors without transparency or registration.

This action seeks to make
Defendants answer for their conduct, restore what was taken from investors, and deter the misuse
of public platforms and personal influence.

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
I.

FJB’S ORIGINS AS A “MEME” COIN AND DEFENDANTS’ UNDISCLOSED
ACQUISITION OF IT
A.

Creation of Let’s Go Brandon Coin and Initial Structure
34.

Let’s Go Brandon Coin (FJB) was created in or about October 2021 by Grant
Tragni, Nicholas Smith, and Caleb Benedict (collectively, the “Founders”), who organized,
operated, and promoted the project through Let’s Go Brandon Coin LLC.
35.

At inception, FJB was branded and marketed using overtly political messaging,
including the name “Let’s Go Brandon,” a phrase widely understood to be a euphemism for the
profane political slogan, “Fuck Joe Biden.” The Token’s ticker symbol—“FJB”—was initially
promoted in connection with that slogan.
36.

As the project developed, promoters began referring to FJB as standing for
“Freedom. Jobs. Business.”—a backronym intended to present the Token in a more professional
and legitimate light to try to appeal to a broader array of investors, despite its origins as a “meme”
coin.
37.

From the outset, the Founders structured FJB to include transaction fees embedded
in the Token’s smart contract, including fees designated for marketing and charity. As represented
to investors, each Token transaction triggered an automatic fee, a portion of which was routed to
wallets designated for those purposes.

8
Case 1:26-cv-00452
38.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 15 of 106
From the outset, the Founders structured FJB to include transaction-based fees
embedded in the Token’s smart contract. Specifically, each transaction in FJB charged an eight
percent (8%) transaction fee (sometimes referred to as a “tax”), comprised of a three percent (3%)
“marketing fee” and a five percent (5%) “charitable donation.”
This transaction fee was
significantly higher than what other cryptocurrencies charged, and it was emphasized as a defining
feature of the Token’s economics and community.
39.

The 3% marketing fee was routed to a dedicated “marketing wallet,” where it was
purportedly to be reinvested to promote the Token, grow adoption, and increase the Token’s value.
The 5% donation fee was routed to a dedicated “charity wallet,” from which donations were
purportedly to be made to charities supporting veterans and first responders.
40.

The Founders controlled and administered the Token’s smart contract on the
Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) blockchain, as well as the associated treasury, marketing, and
charity wallets. The Founders also controlled the Token’s branding and messaging and directed
the Token’s promotion and sale to the public through the project’s website (FJBCoin.org), social
media, and online communities.
41.

Defendant Grant Tragni was the original lead developer of the Token and its smart
contract, and he retained technical authority over the Token’s code, including features governing
transaction fees, wallet permissions, and other operational parameters.
42.

Although Defendants later characterized FJB as decentralized and community-
driven, control during this early period remained centralized in the hands of the Founders. With
that power, the Founders exercised unilateral authority over key aspects of the Token’s operation,
including smart-contract administration, fee allocation, wallet control, and governance decisions.

9
Case 1:26-cv-00452
43.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 16 of 106
During this period, FJB was offered and sold to retail purchasers nationwide
without any registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; without
audited financial statements; and without meaningful disclosures concerning governance, conflicts
of interest, insider compensation, or the risks associated with the Token.
44.

These early structural features—including centralized control of the smart contract
and wallets, the unusually high embedded transaction tax, reliance on promoter-driven marketing,
and the absence of regulatory disclosures—established FJB as a project whose value depended on
the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of insiders.
45.

As described below, these same features were later concealed, reframed, or
affirmatively misrepresented when Defendants Steve Bannon and Boris Epshteyn acquired control
of the project and began promoting the Token to a significantly larger and more trusting retail
audience.
46.

Defendants’ later statements describing the Token as decentralized, self-governing,
and insulated from insider control were misleading in light of FJB’s original structure, which
vested control over the smart contract, fee routing, treasury wallets, and branding in a small group
of insiders who never meaningfully relinquished that control.
47.

Defendants’ statements touting the marketing and charity taxes as investor-
benefiting features were misleading to the extent Defendants failed to disclose who controlled the
marketing and charity wallets, how those wallets were actually used, and whether fees collected
under those labels were in fact used for marketing and charitable donations as represented.
B.

The Founders Secretly Transferred Control of $FJB to Bannon and Epshteyn
Through an Undisclosed Sale Agreement Funded by Investor Fees
48.

In or about December 2021, the Founders entered into a written agreement
transferring Let’s Go Brandon Coin LLC and two billion (2.0 billion) $FJB Tokens to 354 Nod
10
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 17 of 106
Hill LLC and TWinds LLC, which are owned and controlled by Steve Bannon and Boris Epshteyn
respectively. Bannon and Epshteyn assumed “full legal” “ownership of the Coin,” “control,
administration, and governance of the Coin,” and “[c]ontrol of the LLC [and] smart contract
private keys.” On information and belief, Bannon and Epshteyn evenly split the Tokens between
them, with each taking 1 billion Tokens.
49.

As Tragni privately acknowledged, Defendants, through Epshteyn, acquired and
retained control of the bank account associated with FJB’s Coinbase account:
50.

Critically, Bannon and Epshteyn did not pay cash or other consideration to acquire
$FJB. Instead, the agreement structured the transaction so that Defendants’ acquisition would be
11
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 18 of 106
financed through ongoing transaction fees paid by retail investors, rather than through capital
contributions by Defendants themselves.
51.

Specifically, the agreement provided that the Token’s embedded 3% “marketing
fee”—collected from every transaction—would be paid to the Founders for a defined period
following the transfer of control.
52.

The agreement further stated that the Founders would receive these marketing-fee
payments without any obligation to perform marketing services, regardless of whether Defendants
modified, terminated, or failed to carry out any marketing efforts.
53.

As a result, the so-called “marketing fee” was not, in fact, tied to marketing activity,
performance, or expenditures. Instead, it functioned as a mechanism to compensate the Founders
for transferring control of the Token to Bannon and Epshteyn—using funds generated from retail
investor transactions.
54.

The agreement also provided that the 2 billion Tokens transferred to Defendants or
their affiliates would be whitelisted or otherwise exempted from transaction fees, allowing
Defendants to transact without paying the same fees imposed on retail investors.
55.

None of these terms were disclosed to investors.

56.

At no time did Defendants disclose that retail investors were, in effect, financing
Defendants’ acquisition and control of the project through transaction fees that were purportedly
earmarked for marketing and growth.
57.

Instead, Defendants publicly characterized their involvement as a “strategic
partnership” or collaborative effort, creating the misleading impression that Bannon and Epshteyn
were contributing value, capital, and effort to the project on the same terms as other participants.

In reality, the agreement ensured that Defendants assumed total control of FJB with
minimal financial risk, while retail investors bore the economic burden of funding the acquisition
through transaction fees extracted from their trades.
59.

The existence and terms of this agreement were material to investors because they
revealed that:
a.

Defendants’ incentives were misaligned with those of retail investors;
b.

marketing fees were not being used for marketing as represented;
c.

Defendants were not required to provide ongoing promotional or
operational support; and
d.

the Token’s economics were structured to benefit insiders regardless of
project success.
60.

Defendants’ failure to disclose the agreement rendered their statements about
marketing, partnership, alignment of interests, and long-term commitment materially false and
misleading when made.
61.

This undisclosed transfer of control marked a fundamental shift in the Token’s
governance and risk profile and set the stage for the subsequent misrepresentations, omissions, and
investor harm described below.

DEFENDANTS RE-LAUNCH FJB AS A UTILITY TOKEN PERSONALLY
BACKED BY BANNON AND EPSHTEYN
A.

Bannon Publicly Promotes $FJB While Concealing His Ownership and the
Investor-Funded Nature of His Involvement
62.

After the transfer of ownership and control to Bannon and Epshteyn, Tragni
continued to be heavily involved with the management and operation of the Token.
63.

Around that same time in late 2021, and no later than January 2022, the other
Defendants brought on Sarah Abdul as a senior administrator, spokesperson, and operational

representative for the FJB project, communicating directly with investors and participating in
decisions regarding marketing, vendors, remediation efforts, and project governance.
64.

In December 2021, shortly after Defendants Bannon and Epshteyn acquired control
of FJB pursuant to a private, undisclosed agreement, Bannon began publicly promoting the Token
while failing to disclose his ownership interest or control.
65.

On December 7, 2021, Bannon appeared on The Culture War podcast hosted by
Tim Pool to discuss the Token. In response to the podcast host’s skepticism that FJB was yet
another “scam crypto,” Bannon emphasized how he “think[s]” a portion of FJB’s transaction fee
“goes to veterans,” presenting himself as a neutral observer. Bannon then added that he “think[s]
things like FJB … have to be looked at” and “you owe it to yourself to look at your own digital
sovereignty, your own data sovereignty, your own ability to participate in not just cryptocurrencies
but other stores of value,” because the government “destroyed the U.S. Dollar” with its “printing
machine up in Capitol Hill” and spending “$7 trillion.”
66.

At no point during that appearance did Bannon disclose that he had already acquired
ownership and control of $FJB, that he stood to profit directly from increased trading volume, or
that retail investors were funding his acquisition through transaction-based “marketing” fees
embedded in the Token’s smart contract.
67.

Instead, Bannon spoke as if he were an outside commentator or advocate, rather
than a controlling insider. This omission was material because reasonable investors would have
viewed his statements differently had they known he was promoting a Token he owned, controlled,
and economically benefited from.

B.

Bannon and Epshteyn Announce a “Partnership” with FJB and Promote It as
a Means of Avoiding Political and Financial Persecution
68.

Approximately two weeks later, on December 23, 2021, Epshteyn made a guest
appearance on Bannon’s War Room podcast, during which the pair jointly announced their
involvement with FJB.
69.

Bannon pitched FJB Coin as a means of avoiding political and financial persecution
by President Biden and a Democrat-led federal government. Through FJB, Bannon stated,
investors would “very quickly have non-reliance on their financial system,” such that “[t]hey’re
not going to be able to disappear you like the Chinese Communist Party, like the Bolsheviks, like
the Nazis” who “try to … get rid of the good people.” Instead, investors would “have platforms
and institutions that are going to have your back.” Through $FJB, he said, investors would “very
quickly have non-reliance on their financial system” and “total and complete independence.”
70.

Bannon also emphasized that “over $50,000, $60,000 now” had been donated to
veterans and first responders, and that he and Epshteyn were going “to add to the charities that
some of the fees go to,” including supporting “the political prisoners of January 6th.”
71.

Epshteyn added that purchasing FJB Coin was joining a “movement” led by true
patriots who “love America,” that he and Bannon were going to “build” a “community specifically
for holders of these tokens” through “media, parts of shows, videos, et cetera,” and that “exciting
information” was coming down the pipe such that investors will want to “make sure you’re a
member of that community.”
72.

The Token was advertised on the podcast alongside War Room branding, with the
two logos appearing side by side:
15
Case 1:26-cv-00452
73.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 22 of 106
In that same or another appearance on War Room on or around December 23, 2021,
Epshteyn named the Wounded Warrior Project, Tunnels To Towers, Semper Fi, and Patriot
Freedom Project as donation targets to be paid from the FJB charity wallet.
74.

Defendants’ December 23, 2021 statements created the impression that purchasing
and holding $FJB would allow investors to achieve meaningful financial independence from banks
and traditional institutions; that $FJB was a decentralized, censorship-resistant means of avoiding
political retaliation such as “de-banking,” “disappearing,” or being cut off from the financial
system; and that Defendants were building a parallel financial infrastructure that could not be
controlled by centralized actors.
75.

This was false and misleading because $FJB was not decentralized in any
meaningful sense: control over the Token’s smart contract, fee routing, and key wallets remained
centralized in the hands of insiders, and Defendants and their agents retained the practical ability
to control liquidity, dictate the Token’s operational parameters, and—ultimately—disable trading.
Investors therefore did not obtain protection from political persecution or financial exclusion;
instead, their ability to access liquidity and realize value depended on Defendants’ discretionary
control and continued cooperation.

Further, because FJB utilized a mobile app on the Apple and Google App Stores, it
relied on Apple and Google for approvals in order to function, which is contrary to Defendants’
purported development of a resilient parallel economy.
C.

Defendants Continued to Present Themselves as “Partners” to FJB, When
Really They Owned and Controlled It
77.

On December 23, 2021, Epshteyn promoted the Token through his Twitter account
as “the way to protect yourself and not be cancelled,” “[w]ith Biden crashing the dollar.” The
tweet painted Bannon’s and Epshteyn’s involvement with FJB as a “strategic partnership,” when
in fact Bannon and Epshteyn wholly owned and controlled the Token’s smart contract and tax
wallets.

78.

The Token was repeatedly promoted as affiliated with and backed by War Room.

For example, on December 24, 2021, Epshteyn posted the following on his Twitter account:

That tweet linked to an article on conservative news site Gateway Pundit, dated
December 25, 2021, which was one of many press releases Defendants put out. The press kit

It also highlighted Bannon’s and Epshteyn’s ties to President Trump, experience, and credentials,
including that Bannon is a Harvard Business School graduate who worked as an investment banker
at Goldman Sachs and Epshteyn is a graduate of Georgetown Law School.

81.

Bannon and Epshteyn repeatedly tied their personal brands to FJB’s. For example,

in the center:
D.

Bannon and Epshteyn Stress Their Personal Commitment to FJB’s Success
and Promote It as an Inflation-Resistant, Alternative Store of Value
82.

On January 6, 2022, in a promotional video posted to FJB’s official YouTube
channel, Bannon publicly endorsed FJB as a serious, functional digital currency and alternative
financial system, expressly tying the Token to his own experience and credibility as an investor
and business executive. Bannon stated that he had been “very involved in digital currencies,” that
he had “spent many years investing in companies” in the digital currency space, and that he
believed it was “the right time to get involved in a digital currency” because Americans were being
“forc[ed] … into alternative currencies” for transactions and as “alternative stores of value.”
83.

In the video, Bannon further represented that he and Epshteyn were actively
building FJB as a usable currency, stating that “Boris and I, 24 hours a day, are talking to people
about using this currency as a means of transaction,” that they were in discussions with “major
people” and “all types of verticals,” and that FJB would be “used for transactions,” offer
“discounts,” and be supported by “market makers, exchanges,” and a “robust, liquid, deep capital
20
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1

Page 27 of 106
market.” Bannon also represented that Defendants were “commit[ted]” to “putting our shoulder
to the wheel,” bringing in “smart, tough people,” and committing their ongoing efforts to ensure
that FJB would be “a currency we can count on” with real “value” and “use[].” He promised
investors that Defendants are “bringing every ounce” to the project of “[a]ll the skills I’ve learned
throughout my life—as a Naval officer, at Harvard Business School, at Goldman Sachs, all my
years as an entrepreneur and investor, and now in … media or politics.”
84.

In the video, Bannon repeatedly invoked imminent economic collapse to induce
purchases of FJB, warning that the United States was “hurtling towards an economic financial
crisis” due to what he described as an “out-of-control regime” and a corrupt network spanning
Wall Street, central banks, and global financial institutions. Bannon asserted that since the 2008
financial crisis, elites had “forced fiat currency into the system” through zero and negative interest
rates and quantitative easing, creating artificial asset bubbles while shifting the economic burden
onto ordinary Americans. That is why, Bannon said, FJB was “absolutely essential … [f]or the
survival of sovereignty and the patriot movement.”
85.

These statements conveyed that traditional financial systems were on the brink of
failure and that immediate participation in alternative currencies like FJB was necessary to protect
wealth, transact outside the system, and preserve economic sovereignty. Defendants did not
disclose that FJB lacked any functioning payment infrastructure, liquidity support, or safeguards
that would allow it to serve as a viable alternative during a financial crisis, nor that the Token’s
value depended overwhelmingly on continued promotion and insider effort rather than on any
intrinsic economic resilience.
86.

On January 10, 2022, Epshteyn posted a video of himself and Bannon on Rumble
in which they described FJB Coin as a “new economy—an economy that cannot be deflated, an
21
Case 1:26-cv-00452

Page 28 of 106
economy that cannot be copied, an economy that is unique.” They promised that there is “a lot of
new information coming” and “a lot of developments coming” that are “very exciting.” They
directed the audience to FJBCoin.org to learn more.
87.

Defendants’ economic doomsaying created the impression that $FJB would
function as a safer alternative to fiat currency during periods of inflation and monetary instability;
that it could serve as a stable store of value to protect ordinary Americans’ savings from the alleged
destruction of the U.S. dollar; and that it possessed the liquidity, infrastructure, and durability
necessary to serve as a reliable medium of exchange in the event of financial crisis.
88.

This was false and misleading because $FJB lacked independent utility, meaningful
adoption, or intrinsic economic safeguards, and its price and liquidity were overwhelmingly
dependent on speculative trading and Defendants’ continued promotion and management.
Defendants also failed to disclose that insiders maintained centralized control over key wallets and
liquidity and could restrict or disable trading—risks fundamentally inconsistent with Defendants’
portrayal of $FJB as a stable refuge from fiat-currency decline.
E.

$FJB Is Rebranded and Promoted as a “Safe,” “Decentralized” “Alternative”
to the Dollar and a “Utility Token” with “Real-World Applications”
89.

In or about early 2022, Defendants disseminated, including through FJBCoin.org,
an official “FJB App Whitepaper,” which described a new iteration of FJB—denoted as “V2”—
as a “safe, decentralised crypto wallet and payment app,” where investors “can safely store their
digital assets.” The whitepaper represented that the project would enable the Token to function as
“an alternative or a near-replacement to fiat currencies,” “traditional banking,” and “centralized
institutions,” users of which run the risk of being “de-banked.” The whitepaper promised that
“[t]he FJB wallet will not only promote individual wealth, it will also ensure individual freedom
at various levels such as economic, social, political, and otherwise.”
22
Case 1:26-cv-00452
90.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 29 of 106
The whitepaper repeatedly described FJB as a “utility token” that would support
“real-world applications” such as peer-to-peer payments, retailer payments, a payment gateway,
and a fully developed wallet ecosystem, and included detailed architectural diagrams, mockups,
and a multi-quarter roadmap. The whitepaper assured that “[t]he FJB wallet will ensure that all
these features are implemented.”
91.

The whitepaper further represented that FJB “is designed with a deflationary
burning mechanism whereby 1% of FJB Wallet surcharges will be used to repurchase FJB from
the available supply of the Pancake Swap liquidity pool to be permanently burnt … until only 5%
of the total FJB available supply is left” and “the available supply reaches its desired levels.”
92.

These representations conveyed to reasonable investors that Defendants were
actively developing, funding, and executing a functional payment ecosystem, that the Token’s
value would be driven by Defendants’ ongoing managerial and technical efforts, and that the
Token would be a safer alternative to fiat currencies like the U.S. Dollar.
93.

In reality, Defendants failed to build or deploy the promised ecosystem, failed to
devote meaningful resources to development, failed to implement the functionality described in
the whitepaper, and failed to adequately disclose the risks associated with investing in a new,
unproven cryptocurrency.
94.

The whitepaper also identified Defendants Steve Bannon and Boris Epshteyn as
key team members and advisors, highlighting their ties to President Trump, experience, and
credentials, including that Bannon is a Harvard Business School graduate who worked as an
investment banker at Goldman Sachs and Epshteyn is a graduate of Georgetown Law School.

Erik Finman was also listed as a key team member and advisor, and touted as “the
youngest Bitcoin millionaire.” Finman was seen as a crypto whiz kid who could lend further
credibility to the project.
96.

Defendants
intended
for,
and
investors
reasonably
understood,
these
representations to signal that Bannon and Epshteyn were actively overseeing the project and would
use their influence, resources, and platforms to promote and develop the Token.
97.

In truth, Defendants failed to meaningfully promote or develop the project, while
continuing to reassure investors that the project would be revived or expanded.
98.

These omissions rendered the whitepaper’s statements materially false and
misleading.
F.

Despite Being Billed as “Decentralized” and a Pathway to “Independence,”
Defendants Built in a Backdoor to Let Them Freeze Investors’ Wallets
99.

When promoting $FJB as “decentralized,” Defendants failed to disclose that its
smart contract allowed its operators to manually lock an investor’s Token balance—something
that has been described by experts as an “unusual practice” for a cryptocurrency.
100.

If the manual lock were activated, Defendants could restrict or freeze Token
transfers by one or more wallet addresses, including by imposing a global or wallet-specific freeze
that prevented affected investors from selling their Tokens. At the same time, the smart contract
permitted Defendants and other privileged-status wallets to retain the ability to transfer Tokens
and to transact without fees, creating a system in which insiders could continue to sell or move
Tokens while ordinary investors faced transfer restrictions.
101.

For example, if $FJB’s price were to begin to drop, Defendants could freeze
investors’ wallets to prevent further decline while at the same time liquidating their holdings. By
the time locked investors regained access, their Tokens would be worth significantly less.

Case 1:26-cv-00452
102.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 31 of 106
While locks are sometimes written into cryptocurrency codes as an “anti-whale”
feature to mitigate against the influence of big investors, the locks typically come in the form of
triggers that automatically apply to holders trying to carry out large transactions. With $FJB,
Defendants had the power to manually pick and choose whose wallets to lock and when, for any
reason or for no reason at all.
103.

This was no mere hypothetical possibility, but something Defendants frequently
did throughout the Class Period, arbitrarily and without notice to investors.

DEFENDANTS BARELY MARKET $FJB BUT ASSURE INVESTORS THEY
REMAIN COMMITTED TO ITS SUCCESS
A.

Erik Finman Makes His First and Last Appearance for $FJB in April 2022
104.

Despite their promise of “exciting” developments to be revealed soon and their
commitment to work on the project “24 hours a day,” Defendants largely fell silent for
approximately eight months after FJB’s re-launch.
105.

A rare exception was a single appearance Erik Finman made on War Room on April
18, 2022, to promote the new FJB Coin App alongside Bannon. On the podcast, Finman and
Bannon both describe Finman as a “Senior Strategic Advisor” to FJB who helped build the app.
106.

Finman stated that “the goal of FJB Coin is to get crypto and this un-cancelable
financial system” in the hands of “as many conservatives and patriots as possible.” He notes that
he designed it so even his “parents and grandparents” could use it.
107.

Bannon jumped in to note that whereas gold functions simply as a store of value
but not a means of transactions, crypto functions as “an alternative store of value and transactions.”
Finman similarly noted that FJB has “an actual utility to it,” as you can “send it to friends” and
“merchants and small businesses can accept it.”
25
Case 1:26-cv-00452
108.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 32 of 106
Finman, with Bannon expressing agreement, explained that FJB was a response to
“the fall of the dollar empire” caused by President Biden’s “using the techniques that they used on
Iran on the American people,” namely “sanctions” targeting conservatives like MyPillow CEO
Mike Lindell and Lieutenant General Michael Flynn so they “can’t have a bank account.” FJB,
Finman said, is a means “to get free from it.”
109.

Directing a message to “the American people,” Bannon warns “you’re having a
rolling devaluation on your net worth if you hold dollars” because of the government’s deficit
spending, which is “just going to crush the dollar even more.” That is why listeners “need to find
out about crypto” and “you owe it to yourself” to learn about FJB.
110.

That same day, Epshteyn put out the following tweet describing FJB as a “safe,
secure, and easy to use financial alternative” to the “[b]anks and payment processors” that “don’t
care about you or your values”:

Defendants Put Out a Press Release Announcing $FJB’s “First Phase” in
August 2022
112.

On August 2, 2022, after months of inactivity, Defendants sent some conservative
news sites and social media influencers—including Chuck Callesto, Infowars, The Post Millennial,
and CharlieKirk.com—a press release announcing the “first phase” of a “parallel financial system”
and “New Financial System for Conservatives” in the form of FJB. The press release linked to
FJB’s new website, FreedomJobsBusiness.org.

27
Case 1:26-cv-00452
113.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 34 of 106
The release pitched the Token as backed by Bannon and Finman, and part of a “full-
court press to make a new financial system.” The Token was characterized in the release as “a
real conservative alternative to coinbase”—a major cryptocurrency exchange with over 100
million users.
114.

The press release also painted the Token as “essential” for “conservatives … being
banned from payment processors and traditional financial services,” and a means of securing
freedom of speech for “good, honest Americans,” “far too many” of whom have been “silenced
for fear of losing access to the traditional financial system.”
115.

Defendants’ statements in the press release were false and misleading because they
materially overstated the risk that conservatives, as a class, were being banned from payment
processors or traditional financial services based solely on political views.
116.

By framing isolated incidents as proof of an imminent, systemic threat, Defendants
created a false sense of urgency designed to override ordinary investor caution and to position the
Token as a necessary safeguard rather than a speculative crypto asset.

FUNDS IN THE “MARKETING” AND “CHARITY” WALLETS GO “MISSING”
OR ARE WASTED IN UNDISCLOSED RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
A.

Defendants Reassure Investors They Are Working on $FJB “24/7”
117.

At some point, Defendants created an official Telegram community for $FJB
investors, which was in addition to a Discord group for investors formed around the time $FJB
was created. Beginning in the summer of 2022, Abdul and Tragni would host weekly “status calls”
in the $FJB Telegram group, which Defendants treated like investor updates. Abdul and Tragni
would not use their real names in their Discord and Telegram communications but instead went
by anonymized usernames to conceal their true identities from investors.

28
Case 1:26-cv-00452
118.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 35 of 106
During the status calls that summer, $FJB investors began expressing concerns
about the Token’s declining value caused by a lack of promotion by Defendants, as well as the
lack of transparency over donations to veterans that were supposed to be made from the Token’s
charity wallet. For weeks, investors pled with Abdul and Tragni for Bannon to promote the Token
on War Room, where it could reach a wider audience. In response, investors were told that Bannon
and Epshteyn were busy with the 2022 midterms.
119.

On September 17, 2022, Bannon and Epshteyn for the first time joined one of the
status calls to reassure investors and make additional pledges about the future of the coin.
Epshteyn boasted that the coin is “expanding to Europe” and Bannon reassured buyers that “it’s
going to be a MAGA coin.” Bannon added, “I’m available 24/7 on this,” and “I’m working on
this all the time.”
120.

Despite conveying that concrete steps toward European exchange listings or
operations were already underway, no such expansion was occurring at the time and $FJB was
never listed on a European crypto exchange.
B.

Defendants Barely Donated to Charity and Spent the “Marketing” Fee on SelfInterested Transactions that Did Not Actually Go to Promoting the Token
121.

On October 20, 2022, Tragni (who went by the username “Sammy Paradise”)
privately shared with the Token’s operators a breakdown of how Defendants were allegedly
spending the 8% tax on each $FJB transaction, 3% of which was earmarked for “marketing” and
5% for “charity.” He revealed that since Bannon and Epshteyn acquired the Token, Defendants
only spent an additional $15,000 on charity—despite millions of dollars’ worth of transactions
having taken place by that time. In other words, significantly less than 5% of each transaction was
being spent on donations. Further, the total transaction-fee spend was significantly less than 8%
of $FJB sales up to that point.

Among the various expenditures Tragni listed, $120,000 ($10,000 per month) was
spent paying the vendor VFT Solutions. This was for “supposedly SEO” services, according to
Abdul. Defendants did not disclose to investors that VFT Solutions was not selected for the quality
of its services, but because it was led by Epshteyn’s friends, to whom he may have owed money.
As Abdul (who went by the username “sundevil28”) admitted, VFT Solutions did nothing other
than send some Google analytics “one time.”

on behalf of $FJB—something that was never disclosed to investors.

developer and to cover other overhead.

Chase Bailey (“Bailey”), who was responsible for updating $FJB’s code (and who
went by the username “Speshled”) confirmed that Epshteyn had pilfered over $100,000 tax funds
under the guise of paying a vendor:

C.

Defendants Could Not Account for Even the Minimal Amounts Purportedly
Spent on Charity
127.

When asked how exactly the alleged $15,000 was spent on charity, Abdul and
Tragni could only cite a $500 donation to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and an unknown
amount to an unnamed organization purportedly supporting 9/11 first responders. When asked for
proof of even those donations, Defendants did not provide any.
128.

Even the public blockchain does not provide clarity, as any donations were not
made directly from charity wallets, but were first transferred to intermediary wallets that are
difficult to track. For example, some of $FJB’s charity-wallet funds went to an intermediary wallet
that sends money to another wallet that makes high-risk investments in obscure crypto tokens.
129.

Although one wallet appeared to be designated for donation to the Wounded
Warrior Project, the non-profit confirmed that it never received any donation from $FJB after
November 2021 (i.e., after Bannon and Epshteyn took over).
130.

As investors increasingly questioned the use of funds flowing from the Token’s
“charity” wallet—particularly after substantial transaction-based fees had been collected under
Defendants’ ownership—Defendants were pressured to produce proof of charitable donations. In
response, Defendants shared what was initially a cropped image of a donation confirmation email,
presented as evidence that charitable contributions were being made consistent with the Token’s
publicly advertised 5% charity tax.

When the uncropped version was later obtained, it revealed that the referenced
donation was in the amount of just $100.00, and was made to The Folded Flag Foundation on
November 4, 2021—i.e., before the transfer of ownership and control of the project to Defendants.
Further, the donation was made by Defendant Tragni from personal funds rather than from the
Token’s charity wallet, as Defendants’ “advisor” Erik Finman (who went by “FIN” in the FJB
Discord channel) revealed on September 27, 2022:

The presentation of a cropped image of a $100 pre-acquisition donation as
purported proof of post-acquisition charity-wallet activity—omitting both the nominal amount and
the pre-transfer date—underscores the lack of transparency and supports a strong inference that
Defendants knowingly sought to create a misleading impression regarding the use of transactionbased “charity” taxes.

Funds in the “Marketing” and “Charity” Wallets Went “Missing” and Were
Never Accounted for by Defendants
133.

Also in October 2022, Abdul revealed on a status call that an unknown amount of
money in the marketing and charity wallets had gone “missing.”
134.

Defendants were in control of the wallets holding the transaction fees.

135.

When pressed by investors to account for the missing funds, Abdul declined to
provide any more information, citing an “internal investigation” and “legal action.”
136.

On or about November 11, 2022, Abdul privately disclosed to Bailey that
Defendants apparently conducted an “audit” and found that the VFT Solutions self-dealing by
Epshteyn was “drops in the bucket” compared to the total amount of malfeasance that occurred,
describing “what we’ve found” as “unbelievable” and “worse than i ever imagined.” The findings
of this “audit” were never disclosed to investors but were known only to insiders.

“We,” here, meant the FJB Advisory Council—a select group of insiders
Defendants selected from the broader community to advise on the project. These insiders were
given the opportunity to trade on material, non-public information gleaned from Defendants in
advance of disclosure to investors—if there was any disclosure at all.
138.

During a status call on November 29, 2022, in response to investor backlash about
the missing funds, Abdul assured investors that “[t]here is an ongoing investigation with an entire
team working on this,” “[i]t’s definitely not getting brushed under the rug,” and investors would
be notified once “legal proceedings toward regaining missing funds commenced.” Investors were
threatened that if they “accuse anybody” or even “reach out to anybody,” in the meantime, it could
constitute “defamation.”
139.

During another status call on December 7, 2022, Abdul was coy with investors
about the missing funds but confirmed that they were misappropriated: “We are not claiming the
money has been stolen. We’re saying the funds are missing. They did not go to the purpose they
were intended for, and that’s as far as we’ll speak on.”
140.

On August 16, 2023, Abdul revealed that “time is running out” to recover the
approximately $2.7 million in “missing” transaction fees:
37
Case 1:26-cv-00452

Defendants never disclosed the results of Epshteyn’s purported work to recover the
misappropriated funds. An estimated $2.7 million in transaction fees remains unaccounted for.
On information and belief, Defendants directly or indirectly misappropriated the funds to their
own personal benefit.
142.

Defendants’ representations concerning both the “charity” and “marketing”
transaction fees were false and misleading because Defendants failed to disclose that funds routed
to wallets labeled and promoted as charitable or marketing-related were not necessarily used for
those stated purposes, but were instead used, at least in part, for insider-directed Token sales and
other project uses unrelated to charity or promotion.
143.

These misrepresentations and omissions were material because reasonable
investors would have considered it important to know whether amounts represented as charitable
contributions would in fact be donated to qualified charitable organizations. By misleading
investors into believing that a portion of each transaction constituted a charitable contribution,
Defendants deprived investors of the ability to accurately assess the nature of their transactions
and, to the extent investors believed they were making charitable contributions, exposed them to
the risk that such payments would not qualify for a charitable tax deduction.

BANNON AND EPSHTEYN SEEMINGLY ABANDON $FJB WITHOUT NOTICE,

On February 13, 2023, after months of silence, Abdul announced to the $FJB
Discord community that “Epshteyn and Bannon have [] decided to transfer and assign the rights
and obligations of $FJB, Let’s Go Brandon Coin,” adding that she had sold some of her own
Tokens to “have some funds readily available.”

GETTR that the pair “haven’t sold” and continue to “back it 100%.”
146.

On February 15, 2023, in an episode of War Room, Bannon reassured investors that
he and Epshteyn remain “huge supporters of the $FJB project and the community” and have “not
only never sold a coin,” but “only bought coins.”
147.

On February 17, 2023, Abdul, in an about-face, told investors that she, Bannon, and
Epshteyn “remained committed to the coin and organization, and look forward to the future.”
148.

Despite these reassurances, Defendants largely went silent again in the months that
followed.

DEFENDANTS FREEZE INVESTORS’ WALLETS AND RE-BRAND (AGAIN)
TO PATRIOT PAY
A.

Defendants Freeze Investors’ Wallets and Re-Brand to Patriot Pay
149.

In December 2023, Defendants activated the code’s backdoor locking mechanism
to freeze everyone’s wallets except their own.

39
Case 1:26-cv-00452
150.

Document 1

Page 46 of 106
Defendants announced that they had decided to rebrand “Freedom. Jobs. Business.”
($FJB) to Patriot Pay ($PPY), and would be making edits to (“forking”) the code so that it was
now on the Polygon (Matic) blockchain network instead of Binance. On information and belief,
Defendants were forced to fork the code because Abdul accidentally, permanently froze the FJB
contract, locking Defendants out of their ability to centrally control the Token.
151.

In connection with the fork from $FJB to $PPY, Defendants further entrenched
centralized control by deploying the Token through a proxy smart-contract architecture. Under
this structure, a static read-only proxy contract merely references a separate, amendable
implementation contract that Defendants could modify after deployment. This design permitted
Defendants to change core Token functionality—including transfer restrictions, fee mechanics,
and control permissions—without redeploying the Token or obtaining holder consent.
152.

Defendants did not disclose this architecture to investors. By using a proxy
contract, Defendants effectively removed the immutability and transparency safeguards that
investors reasonably expect from blockchain-based assets, while simultaneously promoting $PPY
as decentralized, secure, and resistant to insider control. The proxy structure gave Defendants
ongoing unilateral authority to alter the Token’s behavior and rules, materially contradicting
Defendants’ representations regarding decentralization and financial autonomy and exposing
investors to undisclosed risks of arbitrary modification and control.
153.

In February 2024, after two months during which investors had no access to the
Tokens in their wallets, the fork was completed and the lock lifted. “Freedom. Jobs. Business.”
became Patriot Pay; $FJB became $PPY; and FJBCoin.org became PatriotPay.org.
154.

Defendants updated $FJB’s social media pages to match the new branding, which
now billed the Token as “by Steve Bannon & Boris Epshteyn,” using their name and likeness:

As of the time of filing of this Complaint, Bannon’s GETTR profile continues to
list $FJB/$PPY’s website alongside War Room’s:

In connection with the rebranding of $FJB as “Patriot Pay,” Defendants failed to
conduct a trademark clearance for the new name. Defendants applied to register “Patriot Pay” as
a trademark, but the application was rejected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office due to the
existence of a prior, conflicting trademark. Defendants did not appeal the Office Action, seek an
alternative mark, or otherwise remedy the defect.
159.

Defendants did not disclose to investors that the “Patriot Pay” name was subject to
an unresolved trademark conflict, that their application had been rejected, or that they had
abandoned efforts to secure trademark protection for the brand under which they were actively
soliciting investment. This omission was material because Defendants were simultaneously
promoting the rebrand as a professional, stable, and long-term financial ecosystem, while
43
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 50 of 106
concealing that the project’s core branding faced unresolved legal risk and that Defendants had
failed to exercise basic diligence in executing the rebrand.
B.

The “New” Website Repeated the Same False and Misleading Statements as
the Old Website
160.

Following the rebrand from “Freedom. Jobs. Business.” ($FJB) to Patriot Pay
($PPY), Defendants launched and maintained a new website, PatriotPay.org, which repeated—
and in several respects escalated—the same false and misleading representations previously made
about $FJB.
161.

PatriotPay.org promoted $PPY as a “secure,” “decentralized,” and “uncancellable”
financial alternative to traditional banking, repeatedly assuring users that Patriot Pay placed
“control back in YOUR hands—no banks, no middlemen, no freezing of your account.”
162.

The website expressly claimed that Patriot Pay was “more secure than the bank you
trust,” and that, unlike traditional financial institutions, Patriot Pay users could not have their
accounts frozen or access restricted by any centralized authority.
163.

These representations were materially false and misleading. As Defendants knew,
$PPY was not decentralized in any meaningful sense. Defendants retained centralized control over
the Token’s smart contract and wallets and had already exercised their authority to freeze
investors’ wallets arbitrarily and without notice, while exempting their own wallets from those
restrictions.
164.

PatriotPay.org further represented that $PPY was a functional “utility token” with
real-world applications, including the ability to “buy, sell, and donate with confidence,” to “use
your money freely,” and to support “causes you believe in.”
44
Case 1:26-cv-00452
165.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 51 of 106
The website reassured prospective purchasers that “crypto like Patriot Pay is safe,”
that users’ “money is protected and easy to access,” and that Patriot Pay provided “security,
control, and privacy.”
166.

These representations conveyed that $PPY functioned as a usable payment system
and reliable store of value, suitable even for unsophisticated users. In reality, $PPY lacked any
functioning payment infrastructure, merchant adoption, or operational safeguards, and its value
depended almost entirely on continued promotion by Defendants.
167.

PatriotPay.org also emphasized charitable giving, representing that transaction fees
would be used to support charitable causes and encouraging users to donate through the Patriot
Pay ecosystem.
168.

Defendants failed to disclose that wallets labeled or described as “charity” wallets
were under insider control, were used for token sales, and did not consistently fund charitable
donations in the amounts represented. Defendants further failed to disclose that charity-wallet
funds were routed through intermediary wallets and, in some cases, used for purposes unrelated to
charity.
169.

PatriotPay.org omitted any disclosure that Defendants conducted over-the-counter
(“OTC”) sales of $PPY from insider-controlled wallets, including tax and charity wallets, at
negotiated prices for select purchasers, while publicly representing that trading occurred through
open, decentralized markets.
170.

PatriotPay.org likewise failed to disclose that the Token’s embedded “marketing
fee” did not solely fund marketing, but instead had historically been diverted pursuant to
undisclosed arrangements and insider-controlled spending decisions, including payments to
related-party vendors.

45
Case 1:26-cv-00452

By continuing to promote $PPY as decentralized, secure, and immune from
freezing or insider manipulation—while omitting Defendants’ centralized control, OTC sales
practices, and misuse of fee wallets—PatriotPay.org presented a materially misleading picture of
the Token’s risk profile, governance, and economics.
C.

Defendants (Again) Barely Promote $PPY and, When They Did, Repeated the
Same Misleading and False Statements as $FJB Promotions
172.

After an initial spate of advertising activity following the re-brand, it again petered
out. This again led investors to openly question Defendants’ commitment to the Token, and again
prompted a response from Defendants reiterating that they were still committed to the Token’s
success. For example, on April 20, 2024, Abdul posted the following on $PPY’s Telegram
channel:
173.

On June 27, 2024, Defendants posted a promotional video on Patriot Pay’s
Instagram page featuring various videos of Bannon stating he was “working on tokens for the
populist movement on a worldwide basis,” there was a need to use “cryptocurrency to fight against
being debanked and controlling our own money where they can’t print 6 thousand, billion, trillion

During the video, the words
“DONATE” and “UNCANCELLABLE” flashed across the screen.
174.

The caption of the post declared that “[t]he dollar will continue depreciating,” and
included the call to action, “It’s time you take control!” It described Patriot Pay as “secure” and
that lets users “support … causes you believe in, and take control of your finances!”
175.

There was another spate of promotions that took place in September and October
2024, before the promotions again abruptly ended.
176.

On September 7, 2024, a broadcaster on the Right Side Broadcasting Network
(RSBN) did an ad-read for Patriot Pay with an overlay image describing it as “Decentralized” and
“Steve Bannon’s Movement” alongside an image of Bannon:

The broadcast featuring the ad was uploaded to YouTube, where it has accumulated

On September 13, 2024, Patriot Pay’s Instagram page reposted a post by
conservative influencer Anthony Raimondi (who goes by “Conservative Ant”), in which he
described Patriot Pay as “so easy that my grandma . . . can do it” and “a great way to do donations.”
Raimondi has over 1 million followers on Instagram.
179.

On September 27, 2024, Patriot Pay’s Instagram page made a promotional post
addressing individuals who were “[u]nsure about digital currency.” The post, which exclusively
featured $PPY, claimed that “It’s more secure than the bank you trust,” and “That’s why President
Trump and many patriots are turning to crypto.” The post explained that “Decentralized currency
like Patriot Pay puts control back in YOUR hands—no banks, no middlemen, no freezing of your
account.” “With the dollar losing value,” the post said, “it’s time to reclaim your financial
freedom” by buying $PPY.

48
Case 1:26-cv-00452
180.

The post also included an ad describing cryptocurrency as “just digital money,

The ad reassured viewers: “Don’t worry, it’s safe.” That is because, “with apps like Patriot Pay,
your money is protected and easy to access.”
181.

On October 4, 2024, the same Patriot Pay account made a similar promotional post
addressing the question, “Is crypto safe?” The post answered: “Absolutely!” It claimed that
“crypto is more secure than traditional banking,” because “[u]nlike centralized banks,
decentralized currencies protect your assets by spreading out control, meaning no single entity,
like a bank or government, can freeze or track your funds.” Again, the post exclusively featured
$PPY, adding that “[w]ith the Patriot Pay App, you can buy, sell, and donate with confidence,
knowing your financial freedom is safe.”
49
Case 1:26-cv-00452
182.

Page 56 of 106
The post also featured an ad making similar claims in the context of “busting
myths” about crypto. The ad rejected the idea that “crypto isn’t safe,” claiming that “digital
currencies like Patriot Pay” are “incredibly secure.” The ad also rejected as “myth” the notion that
“banks are more secure than digital currency,” claiming that “actually, it’s the opposite.” Banks
are “easier to hack,” it said, whereas with crypto, “you have full control of your funds.” “Don’t
let this stop you from joining the future of money,” the ad claimed, adding that “with Patriot Pay,
you get security, control, and privacy.” The ad ends with: “It’s so easy, even your grandma can
do it,” revealing that Defendants were targeting lay, retail investors who were not sophisticated.
183.

Defendants’ social-media posts and advertisements were false and misleading
because they portrayed $PPY as simple, safe, decentralized, and more secure than traditional
50
Case 1:26-cv-00452

Page 57 of 106
banking, and as a means of maintaining control over one’s money free from freezing, tracking, or
insider interference, when in reality $PPY lacked those characteristics.
184.

Contrary to Defendants’ claims, $PPY was not decentralized: Defendants and their
agents retained centralized control over the Token’s smart contract, transaction-fee routing,
associated wallets, and trading functionality, and possessed the ability to restrict transactions,
control liquidity, and disable trading altogether.
185.

Defendants also failed to disclose that every transaction was subject to substantial
fees routed to insider-controlled “marketing” and “charity” wallets, that these wallets were not
independently governed, and that funds were not necessarily used for marketing or donations as
implied.
186.

Nor was $PPY “more secure than the bank you trust,” “protected,” or a stable
alternative to a depreciating dollar; it was a highly volatile speculative asset whose value depended
largely on Defendants’ continued promotion and discretionary actions. By presenting $PPY as
safe, easy, suitable for unsophisticated users, and immune from centralized control—while
omitting these risks—Defendants materially misled reasonable investors, particularly lay retail
purchasers, about the nature of the Token, the risks of loss, and Defendants’ control over their
funds.
187.

These misrepresentations and omissions were material because a reasonable
investor deciding whether to purchase $PPY as a secure means of transacting, donating, or
preserving value would have considered it important to know that the Token was centrally
controlled, fee-laden, subject to insider discretion, and incapable of providing the financial
security, autonomy, or stability Defendants promised.

DEFENDANTS STRING INVESTORS ALONG UNTIL THE VERY END, WHEN
THEY PULLED THE RUG ON THE PROJECT
A.

Defendants Again Paint a Rosy Picture of $PPY’s Future
188.

On December 3, 2024, Abdul updated investors on Telegram that Bannon and
Epshteyn were “finalizing everything” necessary to begin regular promotions of $PPY on War
Room and that “everything’s going better than I expected”:
189.

During what would be the final investor status call on January 31, 2025, Abdul
announced that $PPY would have weekly “marketing scheduled with War Room.” During “weeks
1 to 2 we will do 2 mentions a week in the War Room Telegram channel, then weeks 3 and 4 we
will add 2 mentions a week on the War Room social media accounts as well, then on week 5 and
onward we will begin to have Steve Bannon promote $PPY on his show once a week from there
on out.”
190.

None of that came to fruition. Abdul’s assurance that the marketing would
commence on a defined timetable implied that arrangements with War Room had already been
finalized and secured. On information and belief, no such finalized arrangements existed.

Defendants’ repeated promises that Bannon and Epshteyn would promote $PPY to
a wider audience through War Room were material. A reasonable investor would have found it
important to know whether the main promoters of the Token, whose value they purposefully tied
to their own personal brands and promotional efforts, would continue to market the Token and the
extent to which they would do so.

Defendant Abruptly and Permanently Freeze Investors’ Wallets and Abandon
$PPY with False Promises of Refunds

On February 12, 2025, Abdul, out of the blue, announced the “closure” of $PPY
and that its trading has been “disabled”:

She alluded to “significant challenges” she faced “in securing the necessary

Abdul promised investors on behalf of Defendants that “[w]e will be distributing
the liquidity pool (LP) equally among all holders (with Matic), ensuring that everyone receives
their rightful share.” She added that “everything will be completed within the next 7 days.”
195.

Defendants unequivocally represented that the liquidity pool would be distributed
within seven days, without qualification or contingency, despite lacking any operational plan to
execute such a distribution.
196.

On February 14, 2025, after receiving enormous backlash from investors, Abdul
reassured them that Defendants were “working on a solution” for them:
197.

The $PPY liquidity pool was never distributed to investors, and their wallets remain
permanently locked. Investors have not heard from Defendants since Abdul’s promise of a
forthcoming “solution” on February 14, 2025, leaving them no choice but to seek recourse from
this Court.

SALES
OF
On or about December 15, 2022, an administrator in the official $FJB/$PPY
Discord revealed that Abdul was supportive of the idea of offering over-the-counter sales to “OG”
(“original gangster”) members of the group (i.e., those who have been there since the start of $FJB)
directly out of the $FJB tax wallets.

Abdul was not only supportive of the idea, but soon thereafter made over-the-
counter sales herself. As one member of the Discord confirmed, he bought $FJB from Abdul over
the counter on December 31, 2022:

Another administrator of the Discord confirmed that Abdul had been making over-

On February 28, 2024, she told another member of the Discord to refer his friend
to her “if your friend is looking to buy,” as she’d “like to empty the tax wallets before they buy,”

Document 1

Page 63 of 106
Abdul’s statement reflects coordination of insider-controlled Token supply and the
timing of sales to facilitate off-market or preferential transactions. By proposing to “empty the tax
wallets” before a contemplated purchase, Abdul indicated that insiders would first sell tokens
under their control to affect market pricing, after which a favored purchaser could acquire Tokens
at a reduced price, benefitting both the purchaser and the project’s insiders. Defendants did not
disclose the existence of such preferential sales practices or the role of insiders in managing token
supply and pricing.

Indeed, as another member of the Discord revealed, Abdul had been selling directly
from the charity wallets “for a while,” as a sale from the tax wallets “doesn’t dump on the price”
of the Token.

204.

This admission reflects that Defendants actively managed the timing and manner
of token sales from insider-controlled wallets to minimize price impact, rather than allowing
market forces to operate transparently. Defendants did not disclose to investors that wallets
represented as charitable were being used in this manner or that insiders exercised such control
over supply and price dynamics.
205.

Defendants’ conduct and statements were false and misleading because, while
representing $FJB/$PPY as fairly traded, decentralized, and governed by transparent market
58
Case 1:26-cv-00452

Page 65 of 106
forces, Defendants failed to disclose that insiders—including Abdul—were conducting
undisclosed over-the-counter sales directly from insider-controlled marketing and charity wallets,
coordinating the timing and source of those sales to influence price and liquidity. Defendants also
failed to disclose that wallets labeled as “charity” and “marketing” were used as sources of token
supply for insider sales, or that insiders actively managed token distribution to avoid price impact,
confer preferential pricing on favored purchasers, and benefit themselves and the project.
206.

These omissions were material because a reasonable investor would have
considered it important to know that insiders were selling tokens off-market, selectively draining
tax and charity wallets, and manipulating the timing and manner of token sales to manage price
and liquidity. Had investors known that purportedly charitable or marketing-designated wallets
were being used to facilitate insider and preferential sales, and that token pricing did not reflect
transparent market forces, they would have viewed the Token as riskier, less fair, and less suitable
for investment, and would not have purchased $FJB/$PPY at the prices they did, or at all.

THE TOKEN’S PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME ROSE AND FELL IN DIRECT
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’ PROMOTIONAL CONDUCT
207.

From the outset, Defendants Bannon’s and Epshteyn’s own words made clear that
the value of $FJB/$PPY was tied not to decentralized adoption or independent utility, but to their
personal involvement, credibility, and promotional efforts.
208.

Defendants repeatedly told investors that they were “putting [their] shoulder to the
wheel,” that they were “available 24/7,” that they were “working on this all the time,” and that
they would personally drive adoption, partnerships, listings, and ecosystem development.
209.

As Defendants well knew, retail investors purchased $FJB/$PPY precisely because
of Bannon’s and Epshteyn’s prominence, influence, and promises of sustained involvement—

perceived commitment.

Immediate Price and Volume Reaction to Defendants’ Initial Promotions

The most dramatic market reaction occurred on December 23, 2021, when Bannon
and Epshteyn jointly announced $FJB on War Room, explicitly associating the Token with
themselves, their movement, and a “parallel economy.”
211.

On that date, $FJB’s closing price increased by approximately 267% in a single
day, while trading volume increased by approximately 739%, reflecting a surge of retail buying
directly following Defendants’ promotional statements.
212.

The following days saw sustained elevated trading volume and price volatility as
Defendants continued to promote $FJB across War Room, social media, and affiliated platforms,
reinforcing the market’s perception that Defendants were actively backing and building the project.
B.

Continued Promotional Statements Drove Short-Term Price Support
213.

On January 6, 2022, Bannon released a YouTube video in which he stated that he
had been “very involved in digital currencies,” that he and Epshteyn were working “24 hours a
day” on $FJB, and that the Token would become a usable currency with liquidity, market makers,
exchanges, discounts, and real-world utility.
214.

Bannon further framed $FJB as a safer alternative to fiat currency amid an
impending economic and financial crisis, again encouraging investors to view the Token as both a
medium of exchange and a store of value.
215.

Following that appearance and similar statements by Epshteyn in early January
2022, $FJB experienced renewed bursts of trading volume and price stabilization, reflecting
investors’ reliance on Defendants’ assurances of ongoing development and support.

60
Case 1:26-cv-00452
216.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 67 of 106
Throughout 2022, similar patterns repeated: when Defendants appeared publicly,
promised expansion, or reassured holders, trading volume spiked and price declines slowed or
temporarily reversed.
C.

Prolonged Silence and Broken Promises Caused Sustained Price Decline
217.

By mid-2022 and into early 2023, Defendants dramatically reduced their
promotional efforts despite having repeatedly promised sustained involvement and expansion.
218.

During periods when Bannon and Epshteyn were largely silent, $FJB’s trading
volume steadily declined, liquidity dried up, and the Token’s price fell precipitously.
219.

By February 2023—after months in which Defendants failed to deliver promised
promotions, partnerships, or ecosystem development—$FJB had lost approximately 95% of its
value from its post-announcement highs.
220.

Investors repeatedly pleaded with Defendants to promote the Token, explicitly
stating that price and liquidity depended on Defendants’ continued involvement—an
understanding Defendants never corrected.
D.

Whipsawing Statements and False Reassurances Exacerbated Losses
221.

On February 13, 2023, Defendant Abdul announced in a community channel that
Bannon and Epshteyn were “walking away” from the project.
222.

That announcement triggered a near-immediate market collapse, with $FJB’s price
falling approximately 67% in a single day, accompanied by a massive spike in trading volume as
investors rushed to exit.
223.

Later that same day—and again in the days that followed—Defendants reversed
course, with Epshteyn and Bannon publicly reaffirming their support for the Token and denying
that they had disengaged.

61
Case 1:26-cv-00452
224.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 68 of 106
These contradictory statements caused extreme volatility, whipsawing investors
between panic selling and renewed hope, and preventing the market from accurately pricing the
Token’s true prospects.
225.

Rather than correcting earlier misrepresentations, Defendants continued to reassure
investors that they remained committed, prolonging the artificial inflation of the Token’s price and
delaying full market correction.
E.

Rebrand to Patriot Pay Repeated the Same Cycle of Inflation and Collapse
226.

In 2024, Defendants rebranded $FJB as Patriot Pay ($PPY) and renewed
promotional efforts, again featuring Bannon’s name, image, and statements about fighting debanking, controlling currency, and building a parallel financial system.
227.

Following
renewed
promotions—including
social
media
advertisements,
influencer posts, and platform endorsements—$PPY again experienced sharp spikes in price and
volume, including single-day price increases exceeding 25% accompanied by volume surges of
several hundred percent.
228.

As before, once promotional efforts waned and promised initiatives failed to
materialize, $PPY’s price resumed its decline.
229.

By early 2025, after Defendants disabled trading and announced closure without
delivering promised liquidity distributions, $PPY’s value collapsed to near-zero levels, rendering
most investors’ holdings effectively worthless.
X.

DEFENDANTS’ CONCEALMENT
230.

Defendants’ misconduct was inherently self-concealing. Defendants exercised
exclusive control over the Token’s smart contracts, tax wallets, charity wallets, and OTC sales
practices, and they did not publicly disclose the internal arrangements governing those accounts.

62
Case 1:26-cv-00452
231.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 69 of 106
Although certain aspects of the Token’s operation were implemented through
smart-contract code recorded on the blockchain, that code was not meaningfully accessible or
intelligible to ordinary retail investors, who lacked the technical expertise and information
necessary to discern Defendants’ centralized control, wallet permissions, fee exemptions, and
transactional practices from raw on-chain data alone.
232.

Defendants affirmatively concealed material facts from investors, including that
transaction-based “marketing” fees were used as undisclosed consideration for Defendants’
acquisition of control; that insiders were exempt from transaction taxes; that insiders conducted
preferential OTC sales; that wallets labeled as “charity” wallets were used for insider sales; and
that Defendants retained unilateral authority to freeze investor wallets.
233.

Defendants further lulled investors into inaction by repeatedly assuring them that
issues were being investigated or resolved, including statements that “[i]t’s definitely not getting
brushed under the rug,” that funds were being recovered, and that Defendants remained committed
to the project and would double down on promotion and development.
234.

Plaintiff and the Class exercised reasonable diligence under the circumstances.

Investors repeatedly sought transparency during status calls and through community channels,
requested proof of charitable donations, and requested additional promotion and disclosure.
Defendants responded with reassurances, delay, and concealment.
235.

Even so, critical facts concerning Defendants’ control, fee diversion, OTC sales,
and wallet manipulation were known only to Defendants and insiders and were not discoverable
by Plaintiff through reasonable diligence, particularly given Defendants’ use of pseudonymous
accounts, intermediary wallets, and non-public over-the-counter transactions.

63
Case 1:26-cv-00452
236.

Document 1

Page 70 of 106
Plaintiff did not discover, and could not reasonably have discovered, the full scope
of Defendants’ misconduct until after February 12, 2025, when Defendants froze wallets,
announced the project’s closure, and failed to deliver the promised liquidity distribution.
237.

Plaintiff commenced this action promptly after discovering Defendants’
misconduct.
238.

Accordingly, any applicable statutes of limitation were tolled under the doctrines
of fraudulent concealment and equitable tolling until Plaintiff’s discovery of Defendants’
misconduct.
CLASS ALLEGATIONS
239.

Plaintiff brings this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise
acquired Let’s Go Brandon Coin ($FJB) and/or Patriot Pay ($PPY) during the period from
December 6, 2021, when Defendants Steve Bannon and Boris Epshteyn acquired control of the
Token and began promoting it to the public, through February 12, 2025, when Defendants disabled
trading and announced the project’s closure (the “Class Period”).
240.

Excluded from the Class are Defendants; members, managers, and officers of
Defendants, including members of the FJB Advisory Counsel; members of Defendants’ immediate
families; Defendants’ legal representatives, heirs, successors, or assigns; and any entity in which
Defendants have or had a controlling interest.
I.

NUMEROSITY
241.

The members of the Class are so numerous that joinder of all members is
impracticable. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants sold $FJB/$PPY Tokens to thousands of
individual retail investors nationwide through websites, social media, podcasts, livestreams,
messaging platforms, and over-the-counter transactions.
64
Case 1:26-cv-00452
242.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 71 of 106
Members of the Class can be readily identified through Defendants’ records,
blockchain transaction data, and exchange and wallet records.
II.

TYPICALITY
243.

Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the Class. Plaintiff purchased
$FJB/$PPY Tokens during the Class Period and was injured by the same course of conduct that
injured other Class members, including Defendants’ unregistered offering, materially false and
misleading statements, omissions, and deceptive scheme.
244.

Plaintiff was exposed to the same uniform misrepresentations and omissions
disseminated by Defendants through common channels and suffered losses as a result.
III.

ADEQUACY
245.

Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. Plaintiff has
no interests antagonistic to those of the Class and has retained counsel experienced in securities,
consumer protection, cryptocurrency, and class action litigation.
IV.

COMMONALITY AND PREDOMINANCE
246.

Questions of law and fact common to the Class predominate over any questions
affecting only individual members. Common questions include, but are not limited to:
a.

whether $FJB/$PPY constituted securities;
b.

whether Defendants offered and sold unregistered securities;
c.

whether Defendants made materially false or misleading statements or
omissions;
d.

whether Defendants falsely represented the Tokens as decentralized, safe,
and immune from freezing;
e.

whether Defendants exercised centralized control over wallets and trading;
f.

whether Defendants conducted undisclosed OTC sales and insider
65
Case 1:26-cv-00452

transactions;
g.

whether Defendants engaged in a deceptive scheme in violation of Rule
10b-5(a) and (c);
247.

h.

whether Defendants acted with scienter;
i.

whether Plaintiff and the Class suffered damages; and
j.

the proper measure of damages or rescission.

These questions are susceptible to class-wide proof and do not depend on
individualized issues.
V.

SUPERIORITY
248.

A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient
adjudication of this controversy. The damages suffered by individual Class members are relatively
modest in comparison to the expense and burden of individual litigation, making individual actions
economically impracticable.
249.

Concentrating the litigation in a single forum will avoid inconsistent rulings and
promote judicial economy.
VI.

CLASS ACTION IS APPROPRIATE
250.

Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the
Class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief and corresponding declaratory relief with
respect to the Class as a whole.
251.

In the absence of a class action, Defendants will be permitted to retain the proceeds
of their unlawful conduct to the detriment of Plaintiff and the Class and contrary to public policy.
D.C. LAW APPLIES TO THE ENTIRE CLASS
252.

Washington, D.C.’s substantive laws apply to every member of the Class,
regardless of where in the United States the Class members reside.
66
Case 1:26-cv-00452
253.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 73 of 106
Washington, D.C.’s substantive laws may be constitutionally applied to the claims
of Plaintiff and the Class under the Due Process Clause, 14th Amend. § 1, and the Full Faith and
Credit Clause, Art. IV §1 of the U.S. Constitution. Washington, D.C. has significant contact, or
significant aggregation of contacts, to the claims asserted by Plaintiff and all Class members,
thereby creating state interests that ensure that the choice of Washington, D.C. law is not arbitrary
or unfair.
254.

Two of the four Executive Defendants reside in Washington, D.C., and all of the
Executive Defendants operated the Company’s headquarters and principal place of business
located in Washington, D.C. The decision of Executive Defendants and the Company to reside in
Washington, D.C. and avail themselves of Washington, D.C.’s laws, and to engage in the
challenged conduct from and emanating out of Washington, D.C., renders the application of D.C.
law to the claims herein constitutionally permissible.
255.

Washington, D.C. is also the state from which the Executive Defendants’
misconduct emanated. On information and belief, the decision-making regarding the parameters
of the Company marketing strategy and related sale of Tokens occurred in and emanated from
Washington, D.C. As such, the conduct complained of herein emanated from Washington, D.C.
This conduct similarly injured and affected Plaintiff and all other Class members.
256.

The application of D.C. law to the Class is also appropriate under Washington,
D.C.’s choice of law rules because Washington, D.C. has significant contacts to the claims of
Plaintiff and the proposed Class, and Washington, D.C. has a greater interest in applying its laws
here than any other interested state.

Document 1

$FJB/$PPY TOKENS ARE SECURITIES SUBJECT TO THE SECURITIES LAWS
257.

The Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) define “security” to include an “investment contract.” 15 U.S.C.
§§ 77b(a)(1), 78c(a)(10). Under SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946), an investment
contract exists where there is: (1) an investment of money; (2) in a common enterprise; (3) with a
reasonable expectation of profits; (4) to be derived from the efforts of others.
258.

The $FJB/$PPY Tokens meet each element of the Howey test and therefore
constitute securities within the meaning of the securities laws.
I.

INVESTMENT OF MONEY
259.

Purchasers of $FJB and later $PPY invested money or other valuable digital assets
in exchange for Tokens.
260.

Retail investors paid consideration to acquire the Tokens on public markets and
through over-the-counter sales. Every purchase required the transfer of value to obtain the Token.
In addition, each transaction was subject to an embedded 8% transaction fee (3% “marketing” and
5% “charity”), meaning investors paid even more than the nominal purchase price to acquire and
hold the asset.
261.

This constitutes an “investment of money” under Howey. Courts uniformly hold
that payment in cryptocurrency or digital assets satisfies this element.
II.

COMMON ENTERPRISE
262.

A common enterprise existed because investors’ fortunes were tied to each other
and to Defendants’ success in operating and promoting the Token.
A.

Horizontal Commonality
263.

Investor funds were pooled through transaction fees embedded in the smart
contract; liquidity pools; and “marketing” and “charity” wallets funded by every trade.
68
Case 1:26-cv-00452
264.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 75 of 106
All investors’ returns rose and fell together based on: Token price; trading volume;
liquidity; and the use (or misuse) of pooled marketing and treasury funds.
265.

Price charts and trading volume demonstrate that the Token’s value moved in direct
response to Defendants’ promotional conduct and periods of silence. Investors’ fortunes were
therefore interdependent.
B.

Vertical Commonality
266.

Defendants’ fortunes were directly linked to investor purchases. They: acquired
2 billion Tokens through a private transfer; controlled smart contract keys and treasury wallets;
benefited from transaction volume; and structured the project so investor-paid marketing fees
financed their acquisition.
267.

Defendants’ financial gain depended on increasing demand and trading activity.

Investors’ gains likewise depended on Defendants’ success in promoting and sustaining the Token
ecosystem.
III.

REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PROFITS
268.

Investors had a reasonable expectation of profits based on Defendants’ statements
and conduct.
A.

Dollar Collapse Messaging
269.

Defendants repeatedly warned that: the U.S. Dollar was being “destroyed”;
government spending would lead to collapse; investors needed “digital sovereignty”; and the
Token would serve as an alternative store of value. These statements framed the Token as an
investment vehicle designed to preserve and grow wealth in anticipation of economic crisis.
B.

Promotion as Inflation-Resistant Store of Value
270.

Defendants described the Token as: “inflation-resistant”; a “safe alternative” to fiat
currency; a path to “financial independence”; and a hedge against debanking and censorship. Such
69
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 76 of 106
representations signaled an expectation that the Token would appreciate or at least preserve
purchasing power relative to traditional currency.
C.

Marketing and Development Promises
271.

Defendants repeatedly promised: aggressive marketing efforts; partnerships;
ecosystem development; a functioning payment network; and “real-world utility.” They assured
investors, including in weekly investor updates, they were working “24/7” and personally
committed to the project’s success.
D.

Price Reactions to Promotion
272.

The Token’s price and trading volume rose sharply following Defendants’
promotional appearances and statements, and declined during extended silence or broken
promises. This pattern confirms that investors were buying in anticipation of price appreciation
driven by Defendants’ efforts.
IV.

PROFITS DERIVED FROM THE EFFORTS OF OTHERS
273.

Investors’ potential profits depended almost entirely on Defendants’ managerial
and entrepreneurial efforts.
A.

Centralized Control
274.

Despite marketing the Token as “decentralized,” Defendants: controlled the LLC;
controlled smart contract private keys; controlled treasury, marketing, and charity wallets;
controlled liquidity; had the ability to freeze investor wallets; and exercised authority to disable
trading entirely. Investors had no voting rights, governance power, or ability to influence the
project’s direction.
B.

Marketing and Influence
275.

The Token’s success depended on: Bannon’s War Room platform; Bannon’s and
Epshteyn’s political network; their credibility and public influence; and continued public
70
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 77 of 106
promotion. Investors could not increase Token value through their own efforts. Only Defendants’
actions moved the market.
C.

Operational Development
276.

Defendants promised: a payment ecosystem; partnerships; utility expansion; and
technical upgrades. These were managerial functions exclusively within Defendants’ control.
D.

Insider Advantages
277.

Defendants: structured the Token so insiders were exempt from transaction taxes;
controlled OTC sales; managed treasury funds; and financed their acquisition via investor-paid
fees. Investors were passive participants dependent on Defendants’ honesty and competence.
LOSS CAUSATION
278.

Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions artificially inflated the market price
of $FJB/$PPY throughout the Class Period. When the truth regarding Defendants’ conduct,
control, and lack of genuine commitment emerged through partial and full corrective disclosures,
the artificial inflation dissipated, causing substantial economic losses to Plaintiff and the Class.
I.

ARTIFICIAL INFLATION
PROMOTIONAL CONDUCT
279.

INTRODUCED
THROUGH
DEFENDANTS’
From December 2021 forward, Defendants repeatedly represented that:
a.

Bannon and Epshteyn were strategic partners personally committed to
building the project;
b.

they were working on the Token “24/7”;
c.

the Token would become a viable alternative financial system;
d.

it was decentralized and immune from financial censorship or account
freezes;
e.

embedded marketing and charity fees were being used as represented; and
71
Case 1:26-cv-00452
f.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 78 of 106
the Token would function as a store of value amid the alleged collapse of
the U.S. dollar.
280.

These representations created the impression that $FJB/$PPY possessed
independent utility, decentralized governance, and sustained insider commitment. In reality, the
Token’s value depended overwhelmingly on Defendants’ continued promotional efforts and
discretionary control.
281.

The market immediately incorporated Defendants’ statements into the Token’s
price. On December 23, 2021, following Defendants’ War Room announcement associating the
Token with themselves and a “parallel financial system,” the price of $FJB increased
approximately 267% in a single day, accompanied by an approximately 739% surge in trading
volume. The timing and magnitude of this reaction demonstrate that the Token’s price was directly
responsive to Defendants’ public representations and perceived involvement.
282.

Similar patterns followed subsequent promotional statements and assurances in
early 2022 and thereafter.

When Defendants promoted the Token and reaffirmed their
commitment, trading volume increased and price declines slowed or temporarily reversed. The
Token’s price thus reflected artificial inflation attributable to Defendants’ statements and
omissions.
II.

PARTIAL CORRECTIVE DISCLOSURES REVEALED THE TOKEN’S TRUE
RISK PROFILE
283.

Over time, information entered the market that contradicted or undermined
Defendants’ representations. These included:
a.

prolonged periods of silence despite prior assurances of promotion;
b.

failure to deliver promised listings, expansion, or ecosystem development;
c.

disclosures that marketing and charity funds were unaccounted for;
72
Case 1:26-cv-00452
284.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 79 of 106
d.

confirmation that insiders exercised centralized control over wallets; and
e.

wallet freezes, contradicting claims of decentralization.

Each of these developments weakened market confidence in Defendants’ prior
representations. As investor confidence eroded, the Token’s price declined, and portions of the
artificial inflation dissipated.
III.

FEBRUARY 13–14, 2023: CLASSIC CORRECTIVE DISCLOSURE AND PRICE
COLLAPSE
285.

On February 13, 2023, Defendant Abdul announced that Bannon and Epshteyn
were walking away from the project. This announcement directly conflicted with prior statements
that Defendants remained fully committed and were working on the Token “24/7.”
286.

The market reaction was immediate. On February 14, 2023, the Token’s price fell
approximately 67% in a single day, accompanied by a roughly 1,575% increase in trading volume.
The magnitude and timing of this decline demonstrate that the Token’s market price had been
supported by Defendants’ perceived ongoing involvement and that this support rapidly dissipated
when their continued commitment was called into question.
287.

Although Defendants later issued reassurances, the whipsawing statements further
destabilized the Token and contributed to continued volatility and loss of investor confidence.
IV.

WALLET FREEZES AND
“DECENTRALIZATION”
288.

REBRAND
UNDERMINED
CLAIMS
OF
In December 2023, Defendants froze investor wallets while exempting insider-
controlled wallets, and subsequently rebranded the project as Patriot Pay and migrated to a new
blockchain architecture that preserved insider control.
289.

The market reaction to these events was severe. On November 30, 2023, shortly
before the freeze, the Token traded at approximately $0.000264. By January 31, 2024—during
the period in which wallets were frozen and investors were unable to transact—the Token’s price
73
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 80 of 106
had collapsed to approximately $0.000002, representing a decline of more than 99%. The price
fell further to approximately $0.000001 on February 2, 2024.
290.

These dramatic declines were temporally proximate to the wallet freeze and rebrand
and reflected a sharp deterioration in market confidence after Defendants’ actions contradicted
prior representations that the Token was free from centralized control. As a result, additional
artificial inflation dissipated.
V.

FEBRUARY 12, 2025: TRADING DISABLED AND COLLAPSE OF REMAINING
PRICE SUPPORT
291.

On February 12, 2025, Defendants disabled trading of $PPY and announced the
project’s closure, while promising that the liquidity pool would be distributed within seven days.
No such distribution occurred.
292.

The sudden trading halt and operational shutdown eliminated any remaining market
confidence that the Token would function as a viable financial ecosystem. Trading activity ceased,
liquidity evaporated, and the Token’s price collapsed to effectively nominal levels.
293.

This event did not immediately disclose all concealed aspects of Defendants’
misconduct. However, it removed the final pillar of artificial price support that had been sustained
by Defendants’ ongoing reassurances and promises of revival. With trading disabled and promised
liquidity undistributed, the market could no longer rely on Defendants’ representations regarding
continued development, decentralization, or financial autonomy.
294.

As a result, any remaining artificial inflation dissipated, and investors suffered
substantial economic loss.
VI.

CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN MISCONDUCT AND LOSS
295.

Plaintiff and the Class purchased $FJB/$PPY at prices that were artificially inflated
by Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements and omissions.

74
Case 1:26-cv-00452
296.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 81 of 106
When corrective information entered the market—through announcements of
abandonment, exposure of centralized control, wallet freezes, missing funds, and ultimate
shutdown—the artificial inflation dissipated, causing substantial economic loss.
297.

The losses suffered by Plaintiff and the Class were not caused by general
cryptocurrency volatility. Rather, they were the direct and proximate result of issuer-specific
disclosures and events uniquely attributable to Defendants’ misconduct.
298.

Had the truth been known at the time of purchase, $FJB/$PPY would have traded
at substantially lower prices, or not at all.
299.

Accordingly, Defendants’ misrepresentations, omissions, and deceptive scheme
were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s and the Class’s damages.
300.

Although certain events during the Class Period caused significant price declines,
those events did not disclose the full scope of Defendants’ concealed conduct. Defendants
continued to issue reassurances, contradictory statements, and partial explanations that obscured
the underlying structure of insider control, fee diversion, and preferential sales practices. The
February 2025 shutdown prompted further investigation into the project’s internal operations and
ultimately led to the discovery of facts that had been concealed throughout the Class Period.
OVERVIEW OF FRAUD AND NON-FRAUD CLAIMS
301.

Plaintiff asserts both strict liability and negligence-based claims, as well as fraud-
based claims pleaded in the alternative. Certain claims arise under the Securities Act and under
District of Columbia statutory and common law that impose liability without requiring proof of
scienter, intent to deceive, or reckless misconduct. Those claims are based on unregistered offers
and sales, negligent misrepresentations, statutory violations, breaches of fiduciary duty, and unjust
enrichment.

Plaintiff expressly disclaims any allegation of deliberate fraud or intentional
75
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 82 of 106
misconduct for purposes of those non-fraud claims, which are separate and distinct from the fraudbased claims asserted in the alternative.
302.

In the alternative, Plaintiff asserts fraud-based claims under Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and
under District of Columbia common law. Those claims are based on allegations that certain
Defendants knowingly or recklessly made material misrepresentations and omissions and engaged
in a deceptive scheme in connection with the offer and sale of $FJB/$PPY Tokens.
I.

NON-FRAUD-BASED SECURITIES AND STATE LAW CLAIMS
303.

The following claims do not require proof of scienter, fraudulent intent, or
recklessness:
•
Count I (Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act – Unregistered Offer and Sale);
•
Count III (Section 15 of the Securities Act – Control Person Liability), to the extent
predicated on the Section 12(a)(1) violation;
•
Count V (Unregistered Offer and Sale under the D.C. Securities Act);
•
Count VII (Control Person Liability under the D.C. Securities Act), to the extent
predicated on registration violations or negligent misrepresentation;
•
Count VIII (D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act);
•
Count X (Negligent Misrepresentation);
•
Count XI (Breach of Fiduciary Duty); and
•
Count XII (Unjust Enrichment).

304.

These claims are premised on statutory strict liability, negligence standards,
fiduciary obligations, or equitable principles. For purposes of these causes of action, Plaintiff does
not rely on allegations of fraud, scienter, or intentional deception except to the extent such
76
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 83 of 106
allegations are expressly incorporated as alternative theories. To the extent any factual allegations
elsewhere in this Complaint could be construed as sounding in fraud, those allegations are not
incorporated into these non-fraud-based counts except as consistent with strict liability or
negligence standards.
II.

FRAUD-BASED SECURITIES AND STATE LAW CLAIMS (PLED IN THE
ALTERNATIVE)
305.

The following claims are based on fraud, scienter, and intentional or reckless
misconduct:
•
Count II (Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5);
•
Count IV (Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act);
•
Count VI (Misrepresentation Under the D.C. Securities Act), to the extent based on
untrue statements or omissions made knowingly or recklessly;
•
Count VII (Control Person Liability under the D.C. Securities Act), to the extent
predicated on fraudulent misrepresentation;
•
Count IX (Common Law Fraud); and
•
Count XIII (Aiding and Abetting).

306.

These claims are pleaded in the alternative to the non-fraud-based claims set forth
above. Plaintiff does not incorporate allegations of scienter, recklessness, or intentional deception
into the non-fraud counts unless expressly stated.
307.

To state a claim under these counts, Plaintiff must allege facts giving rise to a strong
inference that Defendants acted with scienter—i.e., with intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,
or with recklessness. The facts alleged herein establish scienter under either standard.

A.

Defendants Knew They Controlled the Token While Representing Themselves
as Mere “Partners”
308.

Defendants repeatedly described themselves publicly as “partners,” “advocates,” or
“supporters” of the Token, creating the impression that they were independent promoters lending
credibility to an external project, when in reality they had acquired ownership and control.
309.

At all relevant times, Defendants possessed exclusive knowledge that they had:
acquired ownership of Let’s Go Brandon Coin LLC; assumed full control of the smart contract
private keys; controlled treasury, marketing, and charity wallets; exercised authority over liquidity
decisions; retained the power to freeze investor wallets; and structured the acquisition so that
investor-paid transaction fees financed their takeover.
310.

These facts were uniquely within Defendants’ knowledge. The failure to disclose
ownership and control while publicly promoting the asset as a third-party partner constitutes
knowing concealment of a material conflict of interest, not mere negligence.
B.

Defendants Structured the Acquisition to Be Funded by Investor Fees
311.

Defendants entered into a private agreement to acquire control of the Token without
paying cash consideration and structured that transaction so that it would be financed through
ongoing transaction fees paid by retail investors.
312.

Defendants knew that: the 3% “marketing” tax functioned as purchase
consideration for the Founders; retail investors were effectively funding Defendants’ acquisition;
marketing fees were not contingent upon actual marketing performance; insiders were exempted
from transaction taxes; and the fee structure directly benefited Defendants while burdening retail
purchasers.

78
Case 1:26-cv-00452
313.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 85 of 106
The transaction structure itself evidences conscious design. Because Defendants
controlled the wallets and contractual terms through which fees flowed, the inference that they
knowingly concealed this structure is strong and compelling.
C.

Defendants Knew the Token Was Not Decentralized
314.

Defendants repeatedly represented that the Token was “decentralized,” immune
from financial censorship, and a vehicle for “independence,” while retaining unilateral authority
over core operational mechanisms.
315.

At all relevant times, Defendants knew that they: controlled the smart contract
administration; retained authority to freeze investor wallets; exercised freeze authority in practice;
maintained centralized control over treasury and liquidity; disabled trading entirely in February
2025; and exempted insider wallets from restrictions applicable to ordinary investors.
316.

Representing an asset as decentralized while retaining and exercising centralized
freeze authority constitutes, at minimum, severe recklessness and more plausibly intentional
deception.
D.

Defendants Repeatedly Reassured Investors While Concealing Material Facts
317.

When investors raised concerns about missing funds, liquidity instability, limited
marketing activity, charity wallet accounting, and declining development, Defendants responded
with reassurances while failing to disclose material structural realities.
318.

Defendants knew but concealed: the true nature of the acquisition agreement; the
insider transaction-fee exemptions; the existence and structure of over-the-counter sales; the
limited or self-interested use of marketing funds; and the absence of meaningful operational
development consistent with public statements.
319.

Repeated reassurances made in the face of known contradictory facts constitutes
conscious misbehavior or, at minimum, severe recklessness.
79
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1

Page 86 of 106
E.

Defendants Had Clear Motive and Opportunity
320.

Defendants possessed both motive and opportunity to engage in the misconduct
alleged.
321.

Defendants stood to benefit financially because they: acquired 2 billion Tokens;
benefited directly from trading volume; controlled treasury funds; controlled marketing and charity
wallets; structured insider advantages; avoided transaction taxes applicable to retail investors; and
permitted or conducted over-the-counter sales outside public markets.
322.

Defendants possessed opportunity because they: controlled the LLC entities;
controlled smart contract keys; controlled treasury wallets; controlled messaging platforms,
including War Room; directed promotional activity; managed liquidity decisions; and exercised
operational authority over trading and shutdown.
323.

The alignment of financial incentive and operational control strongly supports a
compelling inference of scienter.
F.

The Abrupt Shutdown Supports Conscious Misconduct
324.

In February 2025, Defendants disabled trading, announced the project’s closure,
and promised liquidity distributions that did not occur.
325.

The sudden shutdown following years of promotional assurances reinforces the
inference that Defendants were aware of the project’s structural deficiencies and material
misrepresentations.
326.

Conduct inconsistent with prior public assurances supports a strong inference of
conscious misconduct.

G.

At Minimum, Defendants Acted With Severe Recklessness
327.

Even if Defendants did not act with intent, the allegations establish an extreme
departure from the standards of ordinary care and a conscious disregard of a serious risk of
misleading investors.
328.

Defendants represented decentralization while retaining freeze authority;
represented marketing and charitable use of funds without transparent accounting; promoted utility
without operational infrastructure; failed to disclose insider exemptions; failed to disclose the
investor-funded acquisition structure; and reassured investors while withholding material
information uniquely within their control.
329.

Such conduct presents a danger of misleading investors that was either known to
Defendants or so obvious that they must have been aware of it.
CAUSES OF ACTION
COUNT I
Unregistered Offer and Sale of Securities in Violation of
Sections 5 and 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933
(Against All Defendants)
330.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136,
163, 209, 235, 302, and 305–29, and any other paragraph to the extent it alleges knowledge, scienter,
intent, recklessness, concealment, fraudulent scheme, or deliberate deception, including but not
limited to allegations that Defendants acted “knowingly,” “intentionally,” “recklessly,” or with
“conscious design,” if such allegations are construed as sounding in fraud.
331.

15 U.S.C. § 77l(a)(1) (Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act) provides that “any
person who . . . offers or sells a security in violation of section 77e of this title . . . shall be liable,

15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) (Section 5(a) of the Securities Act) states: “Unless a registration
statement is in effect as to a security, it shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly
(1) to make use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate
commerce or of the mails to sell such security through the use or medium of any prospectus or
otherwise; or (2) to carry or cause to be carried through the mails or in interstate commerce, by
any means or instruments of transportation, any such security for the purpose of sale or for delivery
after sale.”
333.

15 U.S.C. § 77e(c) (Section 5(c) of the Securities Act) states: “It shall be unlawful
for any person, directly or indirectly, to make use of any means or instruments of transportation or
communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to offer to sell or offer to buy through the
use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise any security, unless a registration statement has
been filed as to such security, or while the registration statement is the subject of a refusal order or
stop order or (prior to the effective date of the registration statement) any public proceeding or
examination under section 77h of this title.”
334.

$FJB/$PPY Tokens are investment contracts within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1)
of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1), and are therefore securities under that Act.
335.

Defendants, directly and indirectly, offered, solicited, promoted, and sold
$FJB/$PPY Tokens to Plaintiff and other members of the Class through means of interstate
commerce, including websites, podcasts, livestreams, social media, messaging platforms, digital
wallets, and over-the-counter transactions.
336.

Defendants were statutory sellers within the meaning of Section 12(a)(1). They:
a.

passed title to Tokens;
b.

actively solicited purchases motivated by their own financial interests; and
82
Case 1:26-cv-00452
c.

orchestrated and controlled the distribution of Tokens, including through
insider-managed wallets and OTC sales.
337.

No registration statement for $FJB/$PPY Tokens has ever been filed with the SEC,
and no registration statement has ever been in effect with respect to the offering of $FJB/$PPY
Tokens. No exemption from registration applied.
338.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ offer and sale of unregistered
securities, Plaintiff and other members of the Class have suffered damages.
339.

As a result of their conduct, Defendants are liable to Plaintiff and other Class
members for damages or rescission, as well as costs, attorneys’ fees, and interest.
COUNT II
Fraud in Connection with the Purchase or Sale of Securities in Violation of
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder
(Against All Defendants)
340.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 303–304 and
any other paragraph to the extent such allegations are expressly limited to strict liability, negligence,
fiduciary duty, or other non-scienter-based theories and are construed as alleging negligence
exclusive of scienter.
341.

Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) make it illegal, in connection with the purchase or
sale of a security, “for any person directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality
of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange . . . to
employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud” or to “make any untrue statement of a material
fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.”

Defendants used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce to
perpetrate a fraud on Plaintiff and other Class members in connection with the sale of $FJB/$PPY
Tokens.
343.

In addition, Defendants used the means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce to misrepresent material facts about $FJB/$PPY Tokens.
344.

Defendants’ misconduct was not limited to discrete misstatements, but constituted
a unified scheme to defraud investors.
345.

Defendants made materially false and misleading statements, including but not
limited to misrepresentations that:
346.

a.

the Tokens were decentralized and uncancellable;
b.

the Tokens were safe alternatives to fiat currency;
c.

transaction fees were used for marketing and charity as represented;
d.

Defendants were mere strategic partners rather than owners and controllers;
e.

the Tokens had real, developed utility and infrastructure; and
f.

Defendants were devoting sustained efforts to promotion and development.

Defendants omitted material facts necessary to make their statements not
misleading, including that:
a.

investors effectively financed Defendants’ acquisition of the project
through transaction fees;
b.

Defendants retained centralized control over wallets and smart-contract
functions;
c.

Defendants froze investor wallets while exempting insiders;
d.

insiders conducted undisclosed OTC sales at preferential prices;
84
Case 1:26-cv-00452
e.

Page 91 of 106
charity and marketing wallets were used to manage price and insider
liquidity; and
f.
347.

insiders were exempt from fees imposed on retail investors.

In addition to misstatements and omissions, Defendants engaged in scheme liability
conduct in violation of Rule 10b-5(a) and (c), including by:
a.

manipulating Token supply through insider-controlled wallets;
b.

freezing and unlocking wallets to control market dynamics;
c.

coordinating preferential OTC transactions;
d.

stringing investors along with false assurances to prolong participation; and
e.

rebranding and relaunching the Token to reset investor expectations without
disclosing prior failures.
348.

Defendants engaged in these fraudulent activities knowingly and intentionally, or
in such a deliberately reckless manner as to constitute willful deceit and fraud upon Plaintiff and
other members of the Class.
349.

Plaintiff and other Class members were ignorant of Defendants’ fraudulent scheme
and of the false and misleading nature of their material misrepresentations and omissions.

But
for the fraud perpetrated by Defendants, they would not have purchased $FJB/$PPY Tokens.
350.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ misconduct, Plaintiff and other
members of the Class suffered damages, and Defendants are liable for damages or rescission, as
well as costs, attorneys’ fees, and interest.
COUNT III
Control Person Liability under Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933
(Against the Executive Defendants)
351.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136,

intent, recklessness, concealment, fraudulent scheme, or deliberate deception, including but not
limited to allegations that Defendants acted “knowingly,” “intentionally,” “recklessly,” or with
“conscious design,” if such allegations are construed as sounding in fraud.
352.

Throughout the relevant period, the Executive Defendants acted as controlling
persons of the Entity Defendants within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act. Because
of their executive positions and control over the day-to-day operations of $FJB/$PPY, the Executive
Defendants had the ability and power to control—and did in fact control—the Entity Defendants
and their agents, including with respect the offer and sale of $FJB/$PPY Tokens.
353.

The Executive Defendants exercised actual control over the primary violations by
directing Token issuance, wallet permissions, promotional messaging, investor communications,
and the timing and manner of Token sales.
354.

Accordingly, the Executive Defendants are liable to Plaintiff and the other Class
members pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Act.
COUNT IV
Control Person Liability Under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934
(Against the Executive Defendants)

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 303–304 and
any other paragraph to the extent such allegations are expressly limited to strict liability, negligence,
fiduciary duty, or other non-scienter-based theories and are construed as alleging negligence
exclusive of scienter.
356.

Throughout the relevant period, the Executive Defendants acted as controlling
persons of the Entity Defendants within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. By
reason of their executive positions and control over the day-to-day operations of $FJB/$PPY, the

357.

The Executive Defendants exercised actual control over the primary violations by
directing Token issuance, wallet permissions, promotional messaging, investor communications,
and the timing and manner of Token sales.
358.

Accordingly, the Executive Defendants are liable to Plaintiff and the other Class
members pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
COUNT V
Unregistered Offer and Sale of Securities in Violation of the
D.C. Securities Act, D.C. Code § 31-5606.05(a)(1)(A)
(Against All Defendants)
359.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136,
163, 209, 235, 302, and 305–29, and any other paragraph to the extent it alleges knowledge, scienter,
intent, recklessness, concealment, fraudulent scheme, or deliberate deception, including but not
limited to allegations that Defendants acted “knowingly,” “intentionally,” “recklessly,” or with
“conscious design,” if such allegations are construed as sounding in fraud.
360.

The D.C. Securities Act, D.C. Code § 31-5606.05(a)(1)(A), makes liable a person
who “[o]ffers or sells a security in violation of . . . § 31-5603.01.”
361.

The D.C. Securities Act, D.C. Code § 31-5603.01, provides: “No person shall offer
or sell a security in the District unless the security is registered under this chapter . . . .”
362.

$FJB/$PPY Tokens are investment contracts within the meaning of D.C. Code
§ 31–5601.01(31), and are therefore securities under that Act.
363.

Defendants offered, promoted, and sold $FJB/$PPY Tokens. Defendants’ unlawful
offers and sales, including OTC transactions and wallet-based distributions, were conceived,
authorized, and directed from Washington, D.C., including through websites, podcasts,
87
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1

Page 94 of 106
livestreams, social-media communications, and electronic solicitations received by investors in the
District of Columbia.
364.

No registration statement for $FJB/$PPY Tokens has ever been filed with the D.C.

Securities Bureau, and no registration statement has ever been in effect with respect to the offering
of $FJB/$PPY Tokens, nor did Defendants qualify for any exemption from registration.
365.

Registration would have required Defendants to disclose material information they
instead concealed, including insider ownership and control, conflicts of interest, use of transactionbased marketing and charity fees, wallet authority, trading restrictions, and the risks associated
with centralized governance.
366.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ offer and sale of unregistered
securities, Plaintiff and other members of the Class have suffered damages.
367.

As a result of their conduct, Defendants are liable to Plaintiff and other Class
members for damages or rescission, as well as costs, attorneys’ fees, and interest.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136,
163, 209, 235, 302, and 305–29, and any other paragraph to the extent it alleges knowledge, scienter,
intent, recklessness, concealment, fraudulent scheme, or deliberate deception, including but not
limited to allegations that Defendants acted “knowingly,” “intentionally,” “recklessly,” or with
“conscious design,” if such allegations are construed as sounding in fraud. Such allegations are
excluded only insofar as this Count proceeds on a theory of negligent misrepresentation. To the
extent this Count proceeds in the alternative on a theory of fraudulent misrepresentation, Plaintiff

realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136, 163, 209, 235, 302, and 305–329, as well as all other
allegations sounding in fraud, solely as applicable to that alternative theory.
369.

The D.C. Securities Act, D.C. Code § 31-5606.05(a)(1)(B), makes liable a person
who “offers or sells a security by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in the light of the
circumstances under which made, not misleading, the buyer does not know of the untruth or
omission and the offeror or seller does not sustain the burden of proof that the offeror or seller did
not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or omission.”
370.

Defendants perpetrated a fraud on Plaintiff and other Class members in connection
with the sale of $FJB/$PPY Tokens, including through a course of conduct that concealed material
information required to be disclosed to permit informed investment decisions.
371.

In addition, Defendants misrepresented material facts about $FJB/$PPY Tokens,
and omitted material facts necessary to make their statements not misleading, including facts
concerning centralized control, insider compensation, use of transaction-based fees, OTC sales,
wallet authority, and trading restrictions.
372.

Defendants’ unlawful offers and sales, including OTC transactions and wallet-
based distributions, were conceived, authorized, and directed from Washington, D.C., and
disseminated to Plaintiff and other investors in the District of Columbia.
373.

Defendants engaged in these fraudulent activities knowingly, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should have known, of the untrue statements and material omissions described
herein.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136,
163, 209, 235, 302, and 305–29, and any other paragraph to the extent it alleges knowledge, scienter,
intent, recklessness, concealment, fraudulent scheme, or deliberate deception, including but not
limited to allegations that Defendants acted “knowingly,” “intentionally,” “recklessly,” or with
“conscious design,” if such allegations are construed as sounding in fraud. Such allegations are
excluded only insofar as this Count proceeds on theories of failure to register in violation of D.C.
Code § 31-5606.05(a)(1)(A), and negligent misrepresentation in violation of D.C. Code § 315606.05(a)(1)(B). To the extent this Count proceeds on a theory of fraudulent misrepresentation in
violation of D.C. Code § 31-5606.05(a)(1)(B), in the alternative to negligent misrepresentation,
Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136, 163, 209, 235, 302, and 305–329, as well as
all other allegations sounding in fraud, solely as applicable to that alternative theory.
377.

Throughout the relevant period, the Executive Defendants acted as controlling
persons of the Entity Defendants within the meaning of the D.C. Securities Act, D.C. Code §§ 31–
5601.01(7) and 31-5606.05(c). By reason of their executive positions and control over the day-today operations of $FJB/$PPY, the Executive Defendants had the ability and power to control—and

The Executive Defendants exercised actual control over the primary violations by
directing Token issuance, wallet permissions, promotional messaging, investor communications,
and the timing and manner of Token sales, and had the power to prevent or correct the violations
alleged herein.
379.

Accordingly, the Executive Defendants are liable to Plaintiff and the other Class
members pursuant to the D.C. Securities Act, D.C. Code § 31-5606.05(c).
COUNT VIII
Violation of D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act, D.C. Code § 28-3901 et seq.
(Against All Defendants)
380.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136,
163, 209, 235, 302, and 305–29, and any other paragraph to the extent it alleges knowledge, scienter,
intent, recklessness, concealment, fraudulent scheme, or deliberate deception, including but not
limited to allegations that Defendants acted “knowingly,” “intentionally,” “recklessly,” or with
“conscious design,” if such allegations are construed as sounding in fraud.
381.

The D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act (“CPPA”) is a remedial statute that
is to be broadly construed. It establishes an enforceable right to truthful information.
382.

The CPPA prohibits unfair and deceptive trade practices in connection with the
offer, sale, and supply of consumer goods and services, and establishes an enforceable right to
truthful information from merchants about consumer goods and services that are or would be
purchased, leased, or received in the District of Columbia.
383.

Defendants are “merchants” that provide “goods and services” within the meaning
of the CPPA. See D.C. Code § 28-3901(a)(3), (7). Crypto apps, wallets, and tokens marketed to
lay users are “goods and services” within the meaning of the Act. In addition, Defendants offered
91
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 98 of 106
and sold non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and branded merchandise to consumers, which also
constitute “goods and services” within the meaning of the CPPA.
384.

Plaintiff and the Class are “consumers” within the meaning of the CPPA. See D.C.

Code § 28-3901(a)(2).
385.

Defendants violated the CPPA by engaging in unfair, misleading, and deceptive
trade practices.
386.

Defendants’ acts and practices tended to mislead reasonable consumers in the
District of Columbia, including by creating the false impression that $FJB/$PPY was
decentralized, secure, and suitable for ordinary consumer use, and that transaction fees labeled as
“marketing” and “charity” would be used for those stated purposes. In reality, Defendants retained
centralized control over the Token’s smart contract, wallets, and trading, and used fee-funded
wallets at their discretion, including for insider and preferential sales.
387.

As a result, Plaintiff is entitled to all forms of relief provided under D.C. Code § 28-
3905(k)(2).
COUNT IX
Fraud
(Against All Defendants)
388.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 303–304 and
any other paragraph to the extent such allegations are expressly limited to strict liability, negligence,
fiduciary duty, or other non-scienter-based theories and are construed as alleging negligence
exclusive of scienter.
389.

As set forth herein, Defendants made material false representations of fact about
the $FJB/$PPY Tokens to Plaintiff, other members of the proposed Class, and to the investing
public generally.
390.

Defendants knew that those material representations were false when made.
92
Case 1:26-cv-00452
391.

Document 1

Defendants intended for Plaintiff and other investors to rely on their false
representations, and they intended to defraud them thereby.
392.

Plaintiff and other members of the Class reasonably relied on Defendants’ false
representations to purchase the $FJB/$PPY Tokens at artificially inflated prices.
393.

As a direct result, Plaintiff and other members of the Class suffered damages.

394.

Defendants’ misconduct involved high moral turpitude and was aimed at the public
generally.
395.

Plaintiff and other Class members are entitled to damages and punitive damages in
amounts to be determined at trial, along with interest, attorneys’ fees, and litigation costs, and such
other relief as may be available.
COUNT X
Negligent Misrepresentation
(In the Alternative to Count IX, Against All Defendants)
396.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136,
163, 209, 235, 302, and 305–29, and any other paragraph to the extent it alleges knowledge, scienter,
intent, recklessness, concealment, fraudulent scheme, or deliberate deception, including but not
limited to allegations that Defendants acted “knowingly,” “intentionally,” “recklessly,” or with
“conscious design,” if such allegations are construed as sounding in fraud.
397.

Defendants publicly and intentionally represented that they possessed expertise in
and specialized knowledge about digital assets, token launches, crypto investing, and the
$FJB/$PPY Token.

By so doing, Defendants incurred a corresponding common law duty to
impart accurate information about the $FJB/$PPY Token to Plaintiff, other Class members, and all
other non-insider potential investors in $FJB/$PPY.
398.

Defendants violated that duty by providing false information about material aspects
of $FJB/$PPY, upon which Plaintiff and other members of the proposed Class reasonably relied
93
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1

Page 100 of 106
to purchase the Token at artificially inflated prices. As a direct result, Plaintiff and other members
of the Class suffered damages.
399.

Defendants failed to exercise reasonable care in the course of providing and
communicating false information about material aspects of $FJB/$PPY to Plaintiff and the
proposed Class.
400.

Plaintiff and other members of the Class are entitled to damages in an amount to be
determined at trial, along with interest, attorneys’ fees, and litigation costs and such other relief as
may be available.
COUNT XI
Breach of Fiduciary Duty
(Against the Executive Defendants)
401.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136,
163, 209, 235, 302, and 305–29, and any other paragraph to the extent it alleges knowledge, scienter,
intent, recklessness, concealment, fraudulent scheme, or deliberate deception, including but not
limited to allegations that Defendants acted “knowingly,” “intentionally,” “recklessly,” or with
“conscious design,” if such allegations are construed as sounding in fraud.
402.

At all relevant times, Defendants Steve Bannon, Boris Epshteyn, Sarah Abdul, and
Grant Tragni owed fiduciary duties, or at minimum fiduciary-like duties arising from a relationship
of trust and confidence, to Plaintiff and the Class.
403.

Defendants assumed such duties by exercising exclusive and discretionary control
over critical aspects of the $FJB/$PPY ecosystem, including but not limited to: the Token’s smart
contract; transaction-fee routing; “marketing” and “charity” wallets funded by investor
transactions; token supply available for sale; liquidity; and the ability to restrict or disable trading.
404.

Defendants also held themselves out publicly as stewards and protectors of the
Token and its community, representing that they were acting in the best interests of Token holders;
94
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 101 of 106
that they were safeguarding holders against financial exclusion and political persecution; and that
transaction fees would be used for marketing, charitable causes, and ecosystem growth rather than
insider benefit.
405.

Plaintiff and the Class reasonably placed trust and confidence in Defendants based
on Defendants’ representations of expertise, leadership, alignment of interests, and exclusive
control over investor-funded wallets and Token operations, while investors themselves lacked
access to the Token’s code, internal wallet controls, or the ability to independently monitor or
govern Defendants’ use of funds.
406.

By virtue of this relationship, Defendants owed duties of loyalty, care, and full and
fair disclosure, including a duty to act in the best interests of Token holders; a duty to refrain from
self-dealing and conflicted transactions; and a duty to disclose material facts concerning their
control, compensation, and use of investor funds.
407.

Defendants breached these duties by, among other things:
a.

Engaging in self-interested and conflicted conduct, including conducting
undisclosed over-the-counter token sales from insider-controlled tax and charity wallets,
coordinating the timing and source of such sales to manage price impact and confer
preferential pricing on favored purchasers;
b.

Misusing investor-funded wallets, including selling tokens from wallets
represented as charitable or marketing-related, and exercising discretion over those wallets
in a manner inconsistent with Defendants’ public representations;
c.

Concealing material conflicts of interest, including the investor-funded
nature of Defendants’ acquisition and compensation, insiders’ exemption from transaction
fees, and Defendants’ ability to control liquidity and trading;
95
Case 1:26-cv-00452
d.

Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 102 of 106
Exercising centralized control over the Token while simultaneously
representing it as decentralized, censorship-resistant, and immune from insider
interference;
e.

Failing to act with due care by neglecting promised promotional efforts,
ecosystem development, and transparency, despite Defendants’ repeated assurances that
they were actively and continuously working to build and support the Token; and
f.

Disabling trading and access to liquidity without adequate disclosure or
procedural safeguards, while retaining control over investor-funded assets.
408.

Defendants also breached their fiduciary duties by failing to disclose material facts
that Defendants had a duty to disclose by virtue of their position of trust and exclusive control,
including facts concerning wallet control, fee usage, insider sales, and Defendants’ unilateral
authority over trading and liquidity.
409.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duty, Plaintiff
and the Class suffered substantial damages, including loss of investment value, loss of liquidity,
and deprivation of the benefit of their bargain.
410.

Defendants were unjustly enriched by their breaches of fiduciary duty through the
receipt and retention of transaction fees, token proceeds, and other benefits derived from investorfunded wallets and insider-controlled transactions.
411.

Plaintiff and the Class are entitled to damages, disgorgement, restitution,
imposition of a constructive trust over improperly obtained assets, and such other equitable and
legal relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT XII
Unjust Enrichment
(Against All Defendants)
412.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 33, 96, 132, 136,
163, 209, 235, 302, and 305–29, and any other paragraph to the extent it alleges knowledge, scienter,
intent, recklessness, concealment, fraudulent scheme, or deliberate deception, including but not
limited to allegations that Defendants acted “knowingly,” “intentionally,” “recklessly,” or with
“conscious design,” if such allegations are construed as sounding in fraud.
413.

As a result of Defendants’ misconduct alleged herein, Defendants were wrongfully
enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and other Class members, whom they exposed to multiple
violations of law and significant financial losses.
414.

Defendants directly profited from the misconduct alleged herein, causing significant
losses to Plaintiff and other members of the Class.
415.

Defendants’ profits from these deceptive practices were achieved at the direct
expense of Plaintiff and the proposed Class, who provided valuable cryptocurrency assets based
on false price information and materially misleading representations regarding token stability,
liquidity, profitability, and market valuation.
416.

It would violate principles of equity and good conscience for Defendants to
keep the profits they gained from their misconduct. Accordingly, Defendants must disgorge those
profits to Plaintiff and other Class members.
417.

Plaintiff and other Class members are entitled to restitution of the full amount
wrongfully obtained by Defendants, along with interest, attorneys’ fees, litigation costs, and such
other equitable relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

COUNT XIII
Aiding and Abetting
(Against Abdul and Tragni)
418.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates ¶¶ 1–329 by reference, except ¶¶ 303–304 and
any other paragraph to the extent such allegations are expressly limited to strict liability, negligence,
fiduciary duty, or other non-scienter-based theories and are construed as alleging negligence
exclusive of scienter.
419.

Under D.C. law, a cause of action for aiding and abetting requires that “(1) the party
or parties Defendants aided committed [a tort], (2) Defendants were generally aware of their role in
the tortious activity, and (3) Defendants knowingly and substantially assisted in the [tort].” Kurd v.
Republic of Turkey, 374 F. Supp. 3d 37, 50 (D.D.C. 2019).
420.

As alleged above, Defendants Steve Bannon, Boris Epshteyn, and the Entity
Defendants committed common law fraud by knowingly making materially false and misleading
statements and omissions in connection with the promotion and sale of the Token.
421.

Defendants Sarah Abdul and Grant Tragni had actual knowledge of the primary
fraud or acted with conscious disregard of it.
422.

Tragni, as the original lead developer of the Token and its smart contract, knew that
the Token was falsely marketed as decentralized, charitable, and utility-driven, while insiders
retained centralized control over wallets, transaction fees, and trading.
423.

Abdul, acting as a senior administrator and spokesperson under the alias
“sundevil28,” was aware of undisclosed OTC sales, insider wallet activity, and the misuse of
marketing and charity wallets, and communicated directly with investors in a manner designed to
conceal those facts.
424.

Abdul and Tragni knowingly provided substantial assistance to the fraud by, among
other things:
98
Case 1:26-cv-00452
Document 1
Filed 02/12/26
Page 105 of 106
a.

administering and controlling wallets used to collect and sell Tokens;
b.

facilitating undisclosed OTC sales and preferential transactions;
c.

advising on how to sell Tokens to avoid price impact;
d.

providing reassurances to investors designed to lull them into holding or
purchasing Tokens;
e.

concealing the true use of marketing and charity fees; and
f.

reinforcing false narratives of decentralization, stability, and insider
commitment.
425.

Abdul’s and Tragni’s conduct were a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s and
the Class’s injuries. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff and the Class suffered damages.
