What Does the Lawsuit Allege?

An investor has filed a proposed class action in federal court in Washington, D.C., accusing Steve Bannon, Boris Epshteyn and related entities of selling an unregistered cryptocurrency to thousands of retail investors while concealing key risks and governance issues.

The complaint names Bannon, a longtime ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, along with Epshteyn, Bannon’s War Room media company, Let’s Go Brandon Coin LLC and Patriot Pay LLC, among others. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

The plaintiff, Missouri resident Andrew Barr, said he lost more than $58,000 investing in the token. According to the complaint, the defendants promoted a digital asset initially branded as Let’s Go Brandon Coin, or $FJB, which was later rebranded as Patriot Pay, or $PPY.

Barr alleges the token was marketed as a vehicle for financial independence and community participation but was, in reality, “an unregistered, highly speculative asset.” The lawsuit claims that material information about the token’s risks and structure was not disclosed to investors.
Investor Takeaway

The case highlights ongoing legal exposure for politically branded tokens that may fall within securities law definitions, particularly where retail investors are targeted through media platforms.
What Role Did Promotion and Rebranding Play?

The complaint alleges that Bannon and Epshteyn used their public platforms and political following to drive interest in the token. By tying the asset to conservative political branding, the lawsuit claims the defendants were able to attract a broad base of retail buyers.

In early 2025, trading in the token was allegedly disabled. The lawsuit states that the project was then shut down and investors were promised a distribution of remaining liquidity. According to the complaint, that distribution has not occurred.

Barr argues that securities laws were designed to prevent influential insiders from exploiting public trust. “The securities laws exist precisely to prevent influential insiders from exploiting trust, obscuring material facts and shifting risk onto retail investors without transparency or registration,” he said in the complaint.

Constantine Economides, a lawyer for the plaintiff, added in a statement that “millions of Americans use cryptoassets and blockchain technology in legitimate ways that benefit our society and economy, and bad actors — who use misrepresentations, fraud or schemes — should not be tolerated.”
How Does This Fit Into Broader Crypto Enforcement Trends?

The lawsuit alleges violations of federal securities laws, consumer protection statutes and other regulations. It seeks unspecified monetary damages and aims to represent a nationwide class of thousands of retail investors who purchased the tokens.

While courts have issued mixed rulings on whether certain crypto tokens qualify as securities, enforcement actions and private lawsuits continue to test the boundaries. Cases often hinge on how a token is marketed, whether profits are tied to the efforts of promoters, and whether required disclosures were provided.

Politically themed tokens add another layer of scrutiny, particularly when promotion occurs through high-profile media channels. Regulators and plaintiffs have increasingly focused on whether branding and community narratives mask financial risk.
Investor Takeaway

Investors in branded or politically linked tokens face elevated legal and liquidity risks, especially if projects halt trading or restructure without clear disclosure frameworks.
What Happens Next?

As of Friday, lawyers for the defendants had not yet entered appearances in the case. Bannon, War Room and Epshteyn were not immediately available for comment, according to the report.

The case, Andrew Barr v. Stephen Bannon et al, has been assigned case number 26-cv-452 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. If certified as a class action, it could expose the defendants to broader financial liability depending on how the court interprets the token’s status under securities law.
