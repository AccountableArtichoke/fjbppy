(0:00 - 44:14)
All right, uh, hopefully you all can hear me let me know if not uh, happy tuesday Uh, sorry, I know I haven't been in the chat so much today I had a few personal appointments earlier in the day and then uh, it's been a lot of meetings all day Uh, and then I had to walk the dogs really quick so they don't drive me nuts for the rest of the night uh, so I will first get these questions answered I think I had a few coming up in my inbox. I have a few people Asking again if they can sell their fjb again. That's totally up to you. 

My answer has not changed On that and it will not change no matter how many times you ask me The answer is the same. I personally would not sell any fjb until I got my airdrop But we have taken the snapshot already, so The rest is up to you I just personally would not Other than that a few tax questions Um, i'm, sorry, I cannot answer your crypto tax Questions. I am not a tax professional um So I highly recommend finding a tax professional in your state who has crypto experience We can probably eventually have some kind of Directory or something like that now for the more specific questions Uh, what is the current status? So we did start testing Yesterday Which is super exciting did some testing last night now we are just waiting for change now and transact to turn on a few things Before we can test in the app That way this will be a testing of everything. 

We've been working on including the contract and the app integration And also test out everything change now and transact have been working on and make sure it all Works great together So i'll keep you updated on the progress of that after that's complete. We should really just need 24 hours to test that At most assuming everything goes great there and everything functions as intended then we will um Enable trading for all of you to begin testing. We'll provide you with exact instructions on how to do that There'll be minimum transaction and maximum transaction amount so you won't be able to Really not follow directions, um should be fairly easy if you are wanting to test Uh, you'll be able to do that. 

I'll make an announcement as soon as that's ready for you all to do After that we will uh Enable full trading with no minimums or maximums. I will give you 24 hours before that happens with instructions And uh, we'll do the airdrops then And start releasing everything to you all so super exciting stuff um What has the dev testing shown Um our team testing so far everything is working as intended, which is great news uh, when will dev testing, uh conclude Assuming team testing, um again just waiting on once change now and transect both get everything Enabled we will be able to test via app. So we want to make sure at this point Um, I know originally said we're not going to wait till To for the app to go completely live, but at this point everything's complete So it just makes sense to test it all at once and have you uh Have the team test it all at once and have you all test it all at once and just make sure It all works together while we're at it um so So to answer that question the team testing will conclude after we have about 24 hours to test Via app that way we can test the new contract and test all the integrations in the app super exciting Finally coming together. 

Um, my desk has like this glass top because under it I could put like photos and stuff Keeps creaking definitely need a new desk, I think um Um, when will community testing commence I think I answered that I think I answered when is the airdrop scheduled Any other concerns that may delay the project? No, not at all um everything's Wonderful Very great. We are still working on several other things. Uh Uh Basically pertaining to our full launch and marketing on war room. 

We are still working or We the the devs are still working on Is easier app Account creation, I think it's pretty easy, but everything else for you guys just making that super super easy uh streamlining it so It Basically minimizes any user error before we go full blown Um and market the heck out of this Uh, I think that concludes the questions in my inbox Let me see let me answer some other ones if there are in general chat and then I will go on with any other updates that aren't covered with you all's questions Let's see Is it safe to assume that my coin value is much higher than it shows or is the current price where we are at I'm, not sure what you're talking about. So Did apple and google approve name change yet? Uh, no, not so much the name change we're stuck on but more technical uh Edits that the dev is working on Um is 1776 a hint that full-blown marketing launch is july 4th. No It's not just uh, you know our just our independence From all the Not so great people um, okay When's the estimate for transact and change now to complete their thing? Uh, they've actually completed Everything they need to complete. 

Uh, they literally just need to enable trading but Uh with the timing and it being a new year a lot of their employees are out of the office So I don't know if they had a few beverages or what? But they deserve a day off I guess I guess other employees get days off must be nice Uh, is this the actual fjb price, uh, that looks about right Sorry, I thought you were talking about patriot pay, um, but trust wallet should give you a pretty accurate price I think Um, why does my mic sound better today i'm not sure i'm still using the same two mics estimate for estimate for them to enable uh Speaking on transact and change now. They literally need to press a button I mean tiny bit more than that, but they've had everything completed for I want to say a few weeks now actually so um So i'm assuming they just want nobody wants to get in trouble for anything Probably need some of their higher-ups to approve is what i'm assuming um, but I did just check with them right before the Voice chat like a few minutes before as I was setting up and they said they are still waiting on approval Let's see Okay, okay, what else um So that's today the majority of today's meetings Actually a meeting that was broken up because I had to get off to get on the attorney call um It's really just simplifying The app even further just so you all are not having issues. Um I know I have a few of you still waiting On me to get back to you. 

I told you i'd update you as soon as I have an update I've not forgotten about you. We are still working on a few things, uh with best as far as that goes, so Don't worry if i've told you I will get back to you. I will once I do have a solution for you. 

We are still working on that I'm very excited for that. I think that will be a major milestone as we continue to Simplify the app which is a big deal. I know a lot of you may not use the app, but it is a big deal because uh that we will use that as our vehicle to market uh, that'll help us in more than one way Um and also just to the future basically for us to Build something more than just a coin um, and then Obviously to make it easier for everybody else on war room and Other platforms that is not familiar with trust wallet or any of that. 

So that's why that is so important That's really it I'm super excited for the airdrops. I'm not excited for Um some of the bookkeeping that goes with that Yeah a bunch of I guess Paperwork Um Can you give a rundown of what you think will happen over the next seven days, oh gosh, okay, so it's Tuesday, I can't believe it's only tuesday. I am feeling better. 

By the way. Thank you I know a few of you have dm'd that I will get back to dms. Uh May not be tonight because I have a lot of other things to take care of Uh that take a little bit of priority, but uh, definitely tomorrow Um mostly except my cough gets really bad at night still uh, but the next seven days Which gives us until What next monday tuesday? Um, we definitely plan to have change now and tranzac enable trading that way we can start team testing on the app um, we do expect everything to go smoothly, but Um, you know, you guys know how that goes especially with having uh so many different Factors in play, which is the new app integration the new tranzac um Listing the new change now listing so there's you know a few things that could possibly go wrong there But again, we do expect testing has gone super smooth so far and as expected um, so I will keep you updated on how that goes, but uh Depending on how that goes and once that testing is completed by the team, we will begin community testing Um, we expect that to go smoothly, especially if team testing goes smoothly, but again with with volume We'll have a better idea of that Um, if we have anything come up, it'll be our app devs uh or change now and tranzac needing to take care or Modify take care of or modify anything. 

So we'll keep you updated on how that goes Uh, it's nice because if we are running into issues, we uh, all we have to do is disable trading Uh devs get back to work Do what they need to do and then we just enable trading and go back to testing. So um Very nice there once again once that's complete then we will Go on to give you a 24 hour notice with full instructions on How what you need to do basically to be ready in case you do want to Purchase ppy as soon as we're live with no limits because testing will have Some very low limits. We're talking a few dollars a transaction probably Um, so i'll give you then the 24 hour notice once testing is complete for you all to get ready do everything you need to Uh add the final contract in your apps in your wallets and then we will do the airdrop then to release the video and probably hold a Voice chat, which I imagine will go a little bit longer to answer some questions and some details of the new contract that uh That didn't make it into the video um Into the announcement videos what i'm referring to uh Yeah, I think it should be a good next seven days. 

But again, a lot of that does depend on Uh testing and how testing goes as you all know There's times that testing goes exactly as it should which it has so far And times that is not the case. So if that's not the case, obviously this will take a little bit longer um depending on What goes wrong if anything during testing and what changes devs need to make? Um I also expect to be working on a solution. We are still We are still not uh, we haven't come to an agreement on a Final solution for the app to simplify it further Within seven days. 

We definitely expect to have come to an agreement and started work on The changes in the app to simplify the app hopefully that made sense Uh war room end of month so war room will happen as soon as As soon as the team agrees that the app is easy enough to not to work smoothly and not cause A mini nightmare, uh or a fire right because we don't want to announce Uh patriot pay on war room and have viewers have a bad experience you all know Most of you probably remember when we did go live on the fire day Just how many sales we had coming in? Um So That's where we're out with that. We want to make sure everything that's why uh getting the app to be as simple as possible And user-friendly as possible is a top priority Mainly right now, I think the biggest issue we're having is new devices When you all get a new device a new phone or a new laptop It seems like that's where most of the issues happen It's logging into your old account and still being able to access your wallet like that uh, so War room will be as soon as we the team agrees that it is Simple enough for your average war room viewer that they're not getting confused or frustrated or losing their funds um or anything like that, so I think we are very very close to that and steve is Very excited about that as is boris Um Where's our damn launch video? Oh my gosh, what's wrong? Stop yelling. Why are you yelling? Um How do Slash do you plan to support online businesses? Shopify etc How do we plan to support those businesses You mean to and to get ppy integrated in there, sorry, i'm not sure what you're asking exactly The ap hit piece should be discussed. 

I don't i've not received a copy of an ap hit piece So i'm not sure Uh what you're referring to So Are there plans to have bmp jump on a bmb jump on a voice to reaffirm the future plans, uh, yes Oh slinky has those details Yeah, i'm not sure what that's i've not heard anything about that And I although I don't always read my dms reply them right away. I see them coming in most of the time So unless it's uh in my archive somewhere Um, but I'll take any uh publicity I'd enjoy that things things have changed a lot. Uh in the past year And I don't shy away from we'll take that if they want to advertise for us for free They'll save the community some advertising money some marketing money Be fine with that Um The one that's coming from that dumb website, oh, yeah, don't worry don't worry we're on that I don't know guys i've never i've never had to file so many restraining orders in my life I've never had to file a restraining order in my life ever like yeah dated some crazy guys but like, you know, you move on with life and you're both Decent people to move Walk away not need a restraining order against anybody but apparently, you know, that's begin begins now People that have online businesses and use shopping cart software like shopify big uh, yeah okay, so how do we plan so Uh, we will since that's why our app is such a big deal Right, even though i've seen you know some of you wondering about that Um, and as far as oh is steve gonna actually Market our coin. 

Yes. Absolutely. That's the plan um, but that's uh, why I mean shopify That's fine. 

We use them. Um, but they're they're pretty woke and this is what's great about having our own app and uh, Starting to create something of our own Um Was the ap reporter? Yeah, the ap reporter hasn't uh, Hasn't contacted me yet. I thought he was gonna contact me. 

I had some good screenshots and information for him, but nothing yet Nothing yet still waiting on that Payment processing is added to those platforms through third-party apps and plugins. Uh, yes Obviously with us even though we're not, you know called fjb anymore uh still having our b&b affiliation uh Again, I think we'll our our plan is to focus on something of our own and something more so in the conservative world It's changed now an off-ramp And an on-ramp like transact i've never used it as an on-ramp and then off-ramp I've only used it like simple swap So that's actually a great question, uh, we use them in the app just as a change exchange service um to my knowledge Um They don't provide that for our needs But that does not mean they don't provide that if that makes sense And by uh By that I mean that when we we've definitely considered them before for an on and off ramp and they didn't They didn't fit our needs for all the states that we need them to cover um If I remember correctly, but that doesn't mean that they don't uh provide that service in the states um I'm sure others can answer that question if they uh use that in their state or not but that's why transact has been a godsend they are a Very small company that is growing rapidly and they uh have grown with us And they've done a ton for us. They've been great Yeah Shoot I forgot about discord Um What's the hold up on the airdrop is a matter of wanting the app to work? So people once they get their coins can go crazy and do whatever at that point Um, no the issue with the airdrop. 

I mean if you guys want to go crazy you can Uh the issue with the airdrop Uh and not doing that is we want to make sure the the contract is finalized um because if testing doesn't go well or if there's anything wrong if we need to make changes to the contract or if we need to start uh A new contract in a sense and have a new contract number then we don't want to do airdrops. Um The way we're doing them is not the most time consuming Excuse me, um process but it's uh still quite a process. So That is why we are waiting to make sure all testing goes smoothly before the airdrops and why it's important to do that for us What i'm hearing on here from some people when ppy drops it will be closer to 0.0003. What's the best guess? Uh, I think price right now is higher than that I think it's at three seven Will you be hiring the same people that stole the last pile of loot i'm not sure what you're talking about One cell Not sure what you're referring to Patriot pay will be announced on war room. 

No, we're not making our first announcement on war room. But once our app is Super easy that people have don't have issues like we did on fire day then absolutely Uh steve has Fired the f up Um Will skb be mentioning ppy one time on war room or will he go all in moving forward? No, that's why we want to make sure everything is uh working great So we can market the heck out of it um, but we need everything to move smoothly so that viewers are Happy and you all are happy and everybody's happy and everything's moving smoothly and that also makes me happy And also makes uh Steve happy I remember one cell when you were talking about wire Um No Yeah, I don't remember now if that was barley or uh spesh I saw spesh driving last time like a few weeks will seem like every few weeks while i'm kind of a dog perk I assume that's when he leaves for work Um You mentioned you're going to try to restore all other accounts with transac again after the launch Is there a month you're thinking of? Oh, we're we're working on that. That's mainly uh waiting on transac Uh, I want to purchase within the app and still can't so I have to settle for trust wallet Yeah, I totally understand. 

I understand how Disappointing that is especially when you want to use the app. Of course in the future. We'd like to add More On ramps and off ramps to help with that however for the time being transac just has a lot of Basically policies in place just to prevent them from getting scammed So what happens with that is basically if we want to reinstate certain accounts then we need to take The responsibility for that so it just comes down to us us transac and you um And us as a company to do that, we just need certain procedures to also protect ourselves so that Not you personally, but you know you as app users so that somebody's account if they get flagged Uh transac says okay, will you if you want to whitelist this account you need to take responsibility if they do do a charge back Obviously, we don't want to do that If we don't have proof Or you know some kind of Protection from you as far as like an id and some sort of uh contract That way in the case that you again, not you personally, but an app user does try to charge back then we have the Contracts to turn into that bank and prevent That charge back from happening that way. 

We're protecting ourselves and the holders because essentially that comes out of you guys's uh hard-earned tax funds Um tesla's not on fire yet Weg says when rich I don't know still poor weg Still poor over here. Okay Ate some organic cheetos for dinner the other day I am back in ketosis today Um Any news on the stolen funds, uh, no our attorney has been uh busy With other things but we will be getting to to that. No doubt um, we've just taken priority in uh using all of our legal Resources to make sure that we are setting Up this foundation for us to uh Get this all situated and then uh, we can get to that. 

Don't worry um That will be Absolutely will be um Addressed Through the correct channels, uh along with anybody Else We will go through the proper channels to protect ourselves and you all the holders as promised When merch we have some amazing merch, um dropping that we will do a ton of it give away a ton of it on launch day It'll be awesome because then you guys can just enter a code and And I don't think there's a way for us to pay for shipping. So i'm sorry I think you'll have to pay for your own shipping um and that way I figure that'll Make it, uh easier that way for you all to get some Merch celebrate with some free merch on launch day Yes, i'm sorry weg says if he was a mod we would have answers just saying I forget Why did why are you not a mod anymore? I don't even remember what you do What did you do Oh, actually I remember You were like undoing other mods work you were you pulled a donnie Except for I don't think you were even drunk at least donnie would be drunk when he did that or maybe you were I don't know but I was having a day already and yeah, you know Patience was running low What else Made telegram mods man. Yeah, we do have um, we have different I don't want to say rules, but we have different. 

Uh Guidelines so to speak between telegram and uh discord I think you guys All get like a little bit more chill Guidelines and discord guys like are allowed to be a little bit more crazy Offends less people in here Got in late, can you recap the main points? Uh testing started yesterday team testing Uh now we are just waiting for transac and change now to enable trading so that we can the team by we Uh test in the app to uh, basically test everything we've been working on together Uh, if that goes smoothly, then we'll start Community testing if that goes smoothly, then we'll give you all 24 hour to enable full on trading And then uh air drops then and then Uh announce everything as far as the video probably voice chat to Answer any more questions about the contract About the copied and pasted contract, you know, um Yeah, I think uh I think that is mainly everything we expect so far testing has gone super super smoothly, but uh, as you know the point of testing is testing so if Stuff does not go smoothly while we're testing on the app, then we will have to wait for devs whether it's our app devs Or transac or change now devs to do what they need to before we start testing again That would be the main Hurdle right now if any hurdles were to come up Patriot pay logo hat me too. I love hats actually some lady um At church gave me this really cute hat and i'm usually not like a yellow person It's like a kind of like a gold like an asu yellow And it's so cute. It has little b on it. 

And then it says kind under it I think it's like my only non-political hat Um Oh, uh Our advisor has been working on answering all you all's questions, so I'll likely have those for you on the next voice chat So In case anybody wants to add to nolan's set of questions, uh, it's probably your last chance to get in there And that's on telegram there's a topic called crypto advisor questions James says the audio is really low in here. I feel like you always have issues in discord james Like why are you you and egg are always trying to make me throw up Low volume. Hmm. 

I'm, not sure why let me see Let me see is the volume better now i've got to figure out a better It's not music so it's progress what was that because you have the music muted maybe Mm-hmm volume on telegram on iphone is fabulous That edible I did give my dogs an edible on the new year's eve with the fireworks I should probably check my email. See if I have any questions there Or Let's check this one. Nope Uh wag All right, well, is that everything How do you off-ramp funds through transact what does ppy need to be converted to uh, I would convert Your patriot pay to matic But that's just me It's pretty funny Well, I think that's all I got If you all have any questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out uh tag or dm me uh I was just gonna say something Oh, uh, don't share your seed phrase Don't download the quick swap app. 

That is not a legit app. I'm, not sure if they still have it in the app store, but Anything that asks for your seed phrase probably not a good idea Nobody from our team will ask you to transfer them funds or ask you for your personal information like a seed phrase So please keep that in mind Don't click on links and don't type up any links that anybody gives you either. That is the same thing Just be safe, uh wait to follow directions, please It'll be very very simple. 

We will keep you updated on everything you need to do and walk you through everything. Don't freak out Don't stress Don't worry about it We will have you taken care of as long as your funds are still in your Wallet and not on some exchange Yeah, I think that's everything if you need anything else, uh contact me or any of the admins just remember We will never ask for your personal information again, please ask in the general chat if you have any doubts Just to be safe. It's better to be safe than sorry But I think that's everything yeah You all have a wonderful night. 

Give me a bit to Convert these files and write up some notes to post them It'll probably be a very long night tonight. Um So I still have quite a bit of work to do So i'll be here if you need anything All right, I will talk to you guys in the chats
