[Speaker 1]
All right, happy Sunday, I just wanted to get on here answer some questions for you all I didn't get anything in DMs or emails. So I'll go through the updates first. We're still waiting on change now.

They're now estimating Monday which is tomorrow. I will keep you updated on that. We'll see how that goes.

They are making some changes That will benefit Them us and you holders as far as the transactions go From how they were handled before to how they are handled now Other than that, our devs are still working on the app. I Will keep you updated on that what they're working on is independent from the Patriot Pay integration That's already been completed and just waiting on change now transact. This is something else.

I'll update you more about it This is kind of why testing we're testing more of the contract To help us with the additions to the app and some modifications happening there So that's all good Yeah, testing has been going great so far so good Nothing on the contract no modifications need to be made We will continue testing tonight if any of you are available. Thank you for helping us test You guys have done a great job, so I really appreciate it Let's see, we got the new Patriot Pay telegram page Which is amazing working on the discord That should be I estimate ready this week. I will share the link with you guys as soon as it's ready Let me go through the telegram questions When airdrop airdrop will happen right after We finish up testing we can't airdrop or we don't want to airdrop until testing is complete And we are sure that the contract Doesn't need to be modified in any way Testing the app will test the app as soon as change now and transact are both ready.

We need them both ready to Continue so as soon as they are We will test it the team. We will know within an hour probably if Devs need to work on it or not if devs new do need to make any modifications that will be high priority They will start immediately If they do not will need a day or two for team testing and then have the community continue testing after that I'll have any of the failed transactions been because of the contract. No At the beginning it was due to our settings because we had the limit set so low at a thousand PPI however, we made those modifications and everything's been going smoothly the failed transactions more recently are not due to the contract or Settings on our side So everything's been going as expected App store name when will that change in the App Store as soon as Apple approves the update?

When Donald J. Trump come out of the closet as advisor Surprise I'm the advisor. I'm the advisor.

I'm the dev. I'm Steve. I'm Boris.

I'm everybody It's actually me just doing everything back here I'm just kidding, but I don't know maybe Donald J. Trump will come out as the our crypto advisor Is Ross the secret advisor hey, yes, but that's exactly who it is. It's Russ.

He's the secret advisor Right now the stable coins balance and the app don't match the trust wallet Will that change in the future they should match? Unless you're seeing The total of your trust wallet or I'm sorry in the app unless you're seeing the total of both your smart wallet and your expert mode wallet If those are added together then maybe that's what you're seeing. However, I do not recommend using the app right now Please don't do that while devs are working on it.

I highly recommend not using the app right now Will testing limits increase so we originally thought we would increase those limits but due to a few factors I don't think that will be happening. But once trading is enabled Completely and everything is live You know, that's when limits will be increasing greatly Why won't you take my money? eventually, it'll be soon and Very much worth the wait in my opinion Did you give an answer as to when the app store name changes?

Yes as soon as Apple approves it Also, you told us not to sell our FJB until airdrop. Is that still the case? Yes, I would not sell my FJB until I got airdropped my new coins, but they're your coins.

So that's totally up to you. I Want to use those to buy PPI? Hey, if you know you have the ability to sell them that is up to you I would not sell my coins until I receive my airdrop, but totally up to you Appreciate all your hard work.

Oh, I miss that. Thank you Mike. All right, let me go through the discord Ren wants a double coin airdrop from me, please What is the overall assessment of the testing and what are the next steps Testing is going well so far.

It is helping us with something else. That's not Contract that it's not Patriot Pay contract related more app related But yeah, we definitely appreciate you all testing Thank you so much for taking the time and effort to test and follow directions. I really appreciate it a ton, so that helps us a lot and It's much much much appreciated What is the test plan now we will be testing tonight I know it's a little bit late But if any of you are online and available, we'll probably be testing very similarly to what we did this morning Okay, I think that's everything If you all have any questions Please tag DM.

I did find several DMS and telegram that moved to my archive chats So I will get to those tonight But please either if I don't reply to you, please either tag me or just DM me again So it moves to the top. I just get a ton of spam, especially on telegram so That way I can get your DM. Hi, of course, you can email call text.

Anyway, you guys sure you all know how to contact me Please do not share your seed phrase Or click on any weird links or type in any weird links. We will never ask you for that No, dev will ever call you or anything crazy like that. If you are ever in doubt, please ask in general chat It always seems to happen when you know Somebody is sick or going through a really hard time or something like that where they're not thinking clearly and they get one of those Messages and fall for them.

So please Always always always just I think it's safest to just ask in the general chat So there's often almost always somebody in there if I'm not sleeping then I'm generally gonna get your message ASAP, even if it shows I'm not online I get the pop-ups So please do that. So you do not get scammed don't download any weird apps either But I think that is everything I did forget to record. So I'm just Now recording this right after voice chat and reading the questions that everybody just asked.

So that's why it moved in a little bit quicker But if you need anything else, I'll be here to help Yeah, I'll be up for quite a bit longer here Finishing some stuff so Let me know if you need anything else in the meantime And we'll plan on a Tuesday voice chat if I get any update on change now before that I will definitely let you know I hope you guys have a great rest of your week Coming through I guess MLK Day tomorrow tomorrow. So I don't know if any of you guys have that off But yeah, I think that's everything on my end, thank you guys again and I'll see you in general chat
