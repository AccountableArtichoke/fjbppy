Is he in here Brandon? You wanna come up? Can I invite him up? Can you just shoot up here? She's listen, is he listening to me? I don't know but Hopefully is if he wants to come up here and kind of give some some space Because I don't I I know it if he's a little bit, but I don't really know what if he's that Well, I can't speak on it But we're doing a whole NFT campaign right now because the NFT markets kind of drying up which is which is what's going on So they need something for their fix. They need something for them and they're they're coming up here and They're gonna do something with The advertisements he knows a lot of people in that space so juiced up about that. Oh, he's up here. 

What's up, brother? How we doing? I was about to get you some coffee. You mentioned my name. So now I gotta stay around Yeah, stay around for a second. 

Do you want to explain some of the NFT things we're doing just to give some transparency? So before this project I was pretty deep in the NFT space in a lot of different communities and a lot of things I did So what we're doing is we are doing a massive outreach to these individuals as Grant mentioned earlier that the space is kind of drying up So we're trying to just bring these people over and like my individuals into our community to keep it growing So I'm super excited. This should be a very successful marketing campaign. We're also working on Marketing internationally speaking. 

So we are already setting up stuff and a lot of other countries and so stay tuned on that as more awesome, and that's the cool thing about international markets is They are untapped one and two they know about let's go Brandon And they know about the movie people from Australia and and New Zealand and shit like that, which is awesome so that's perfect that's really perfect and there we're gonna be doing stuff like that and the NFT space is like like like fanboy said is It's drying up a little bit and they need and it's gonna I don't know if it's gonna come back It probably will come back. You never know but they need something in the meantime, and this is Let's go Brandon coin is what what they need. So I'm excited You're gonna hopefully be seeing some new faces in here and we have what 3,000 5,000 members by the end day and maybe 10,000 token holders So if we do I'll be fucking juiced and this thing will be a success. 

So Yeah, that's what we're doing today. That's what our focus is is on. I have a call later on like I said at 4 and another call with I've been calling people all day about getting some publications and stuff like that This is the did you do do do do and donations before? Okay. 

Yeah, we still thinking penny by Sunday Everyone's not so much. I right now Uh, hey, I would love it. I would fucking love it What does this thing saying? Some board Brandon apes. 

Yeah, we can make the Brandon a job If we could hit a penny by Sunday man, like I didn't I get I can't I can't predict the price I can't predict anything in life. But hey, man, that'd be that'd be awesome I said penny by Sunday and I'll eat a whole pizza I need to fight it to run a couple extra miles to get to get that Importance of shilling shilling is the most important thing because it's telling people About our coin that might not know about it And if they keep saying something and they keep seeing something then they're gonna be like, hey, I'm joining this thing I am absolutely joining shilling is so incredibly important. It's telling somebody else about this coin and It's Britain social media is awesome because it's a it's a it's a place that everybody can go to and see the same things So if we get on there and post the same thing and post different things about the coin about what we're doing That's like that's how you get our name out there. 

That's a it's the it's the best way. It's free advertisement It's free. Nothing in life is free except for you can just go on Twitter and tweet about it And then hey, man, we get trending we get people at seeing it stock to its is trending. 

It's it's true. It's really tremendously important So, that's awesome, I love that a lot Exactly. I dude I wasn't even on social media before this this whole project. 

I literally wasn't trying to get everything going But that's that's what we're working on man We're getting everything all set up getting all figured out couldn't be more excited for this group really could not be more excited couldn't dude the fact that we Fuckin did all this is absolutely and always somebody's message said hey, let me speak for it. Is he is he coming up here to speak? Yeah, I'd like to speak to rock said no and you want us to speak We'll just do one of these and then I should have a call at 12.

You're loud and clear brother. I Love this community or sworn to say that because of this movement and because of who we are There's gonna be a lot of people trying to come on board that either have never bought crypto before or have never messed with any crypto outside of something like coinbase or a real kind of beginner exchange and They're not gonna understand. I mean, this is hard to buy this coin right now If if you're new to crypto, I'm gonna be putting out a tutorial today. 

There's a very easy app. It's not even an app It's called a website. It's simple swap io You set up a trade for any coin and you can trade it to Binance Smart Chain BEP 20 It's a very easy way you it gives you a wallet to send the coin that you have You paste in the wallet you want the BEP 20 smart chain B&B to be sent to so like metamask or trust wallet There's a lot of people have in trouble that have aetherium that have no idea how to fund Their trust wallet or their metamask.
