[Speaker 3]
America, does anybody know what the hell happened to the patriots lately? This nation is so ashamed and hating itself. Did everyone forget that people died to pay for this ungratefulness?

United States did everything to you just to help. I just want to celebrate Thanksgiving with my family. I don't need your help to understand it was a tragedy.

Can I just be thankful for my country eating happily without you trying to kill me for the genocide and casualties? I can't help it. I just seem to see the world different.

It ain't black or white. It's a conflict designed by the system. I don't need your pronouns.

All I see is men and women. Kids are taking pills for fun while people can't afford prescriptions. If you don't like it, go.

Hate it, then don't call it home. We don't need no violence. Got no time for all you radicals.

[Speaker 2]
Screw your status quo. We're not animals. I won't kneel for...

That thing was loud. What's up, everybody?

[Speaker 1]
You guys hear me all right? Came in here, it was freaking going hot. I don't even know what that was, but it was loud.

Let's go, Brandon. Which one was that?

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Hey, agreed. What's up?

What's up, baby?

[Speaker 1]
Take me out to dinner first. What's going on, everybody? Let's see.

I just messaged in the telegram and see if they want to answer. It was Tom McDonald, Tom Mac, Tom Mac and cheese. I'll try to get him.

I'll try to get him. I'll try to reach out to his media manager. I tried to reach out to Bryson Gray weeks ago.

I'm going to reach out again and then I'll reach out again and nothing. We're still waiting. Still waiting, but it'll come.

I ain't worried about it. What's going on, everybody? How's our Sunday doing?

It is Sunday, the 21st. 30 days? 30 days, day 30.

Today's day 30. I love that. That's awesome.

That's the first 30. 50K in 30 days. Pretty exciting to see how much we're going to donate in the next 30.

Oh, shit. What is going on? Get out of here, Mr. Premium. Okay. I took them off. Do you guys still hear me all right?

I wonder if it's going through my headset. Yeah, it's got to be going through my headset. I got to wear this little headset because my computer sucks.

I actually need to get a new computer because I have a nice setup. I got like four monitors, but my computer is ass. All right.

I just wanted to hop in here quick. We're going to have a lot more of an extension, not extension, extensive Sunday talk tonight. Ryan's coming on tonight.

He's going to be here. He's going to get you guys juiced. I'm excited for that.

He's a great speaker. He knows everything about this space, absolutely everything about this space. I'm excited for that.

I love doing that. I love when he's on because he's the man. I wonder if he's in here right now.

Actually, it's Ryan. Is he in here? No, I don't see him in here unless I'm wrong.

I see Ryan B., but not Ryan Fournier. So he's not here, but whatever. He's going to be on tonight.

He's busy. He's got a busy day, he said. So he's like I'll hop on for a couple minutes later tonight.

I say great. People are going to love it. So what's going on right now?

So I saw a bunch of FUD being spread about the exchanges, about probit and whitebit and the other future exchanges. So I wanted to clarify that. That's what I wanted to take the time to do.

I'll go in and out so you guys can get ready for 1 p.m. Eastern football and enjoy your Sunday and then we'll reconvene tonight. But I'm going to be in discord all day long, so you guys can't get rid of me. I'll be in discord and telegram.

I'll be chitchatting. I'll be typing all day long. So again, you guys can't get rid of me.

We'll be hanging out if anybody wants to hang out with me, send some messages. Red Raider, there are some people spreading FUD and some of the FUD that's spreading. I saw a couple of messages about the exchanges.

They're like, oh, it's not coming. They're just lying. I could send you guys the receipts.

I could send you guys the email receipts or exchanges in the telegram chat with the different representatives and different consultants. The thing is, so for example, probit, they're from Korea. Korea is, I think, 13 hours ahead.

So that in itself is very hard to speak to them. So you have to speak to them very early in the morning like we do or very late at night. But they're on polar opposites.

And then the other one is whitebit. Whitebit, the representative that we're speaking from is from Russia. So I don't know the time difference there, but there's probably six, seven or eight maybe hours that are different.

So sometimes you'll send messages and it's like, hey, we're waiting on this for, let's say, 10, 15 minutes, sometimes eight hours. You know what I mean? So it's different.

But probit essentially said there was trouble implementing it and it hit right before the weekend. And I guess everybody and their moms took off on Friday for probit because I called everybody. I was looking on LinkedIn to connections of different people at probit and trying to call them, messaging them from my personal LinkedIn account to try to get them on.

So we're trying to figure that out. That's the frustrating part. But it is 100,000% coming.

We signed a contract and everything like that. So probit is coming. Fingers crossed for tomorrow, if not Tuesday.

Whitebit gave us the preliminary date of this Thursday. So perfectly in time for Thanksgiving. That is 2 million US traders and that's going to be unbelievable.

So I can't wait for that. But I just wanted to clarify what's going on with the exchanges. Those two exchanges are coming.

And on top of that, I was going to say this tonight, but I see some floods getting spread. So I'm just going to say it now. On top of that, we also have meetings with BitMart and Bittrex.

If you guys know those two, those are like two of the top Binance exchanges in the entire world. So we have meetings with Bittrex and BitMart tomorrow. We are already in contractual talks with them.

And that is going to be four exchanges. When we hit these exchanges, it's going to happen so unbelievably fast that it's going to go crazy. Because the thing is, and I'm not sure if you guys understand this, and you guys do, but I know that people are impatient and people like to think exactly what's going on and exactly, hey, where's all the progress being made?

Again, take a step back, zoom out, not just on the chart, but on us. It's day 30. You remember like Dogecoin from 2013?

No, you don't. Because nobody knew about it till 2020. You ever hear about Shibu Inu?

That started in like 2016. You didn't hear about that till 2020, 2019, at the least 2020. That's what's going on with us.

This is not a one-week plan, a one-month plan, which we're on right now, or a one-year plan. The whole Let's Go Brandon movement, and I've seen some people say this too, like, oh, it's just a meme. It's going to phase out.

It absolutely is not, because one, we still have Joe Biden as our president, and freaking jackass Kamala Harris up in the VP seat. They still have years left on their term. What's going to happen too is a tremendous red wave, which we've already seen.

We've already been seeing this. Look at what's been going on. This is like the Republican battle cry.

It's like the battle chant, one for freedom, for no censorship, for none of this bullshit that's going on. This red wave is not stopping at all, because we were in a great position, a great position going into this past election. Then what this realized, what this country realized is we are so shitty when we have these people running the country.

Look how we're getting laughed at on a global stage. When we're back in office in 2024, what's going to happen is this. It's going to be that funny thing that they continuously talk about.

It's like, oh, Let's Go Brandon, because it's like, F this, F that, F what happened. That's what's going to be our stigma to say that's what it was like back then. That's what 2021 was like.

That's what November was like. Remember spending $60 on a turkey? Do you remember that?

That is crazy. What this is going to happen is this Let's Go Brandon movement is not going to go away, because we know the people. We know Donald Trump is never going to let that go.

We know Donald Trump Jr. is never going to let that go. We know that Ron is not going to let that go. We know that Ted Cruz is not going to let that go.

This is just getting started. It's not a meme. It's a movement.

The chant is a movement. Look how impressive we've in the past 30 days. Give us another 30 days and then another 30 days on top of that.

Give us three months. Give us three years. Imagine being in this community and being a part of this this early on.

I keep referencing Shibu, because it's like a piece of shit. It's like a dog. They have 950,000 holders.

Imagine being one of the first 7,000. It's so crazy to think about, because you can't conceptualize it. That thing is still going on.

There's nothing behind it. There's no association to it. When 74 million people, if not more, 100% more, voted for Donald Trump in 2020, it was 1% of that population.

That's 740,000. This is going to be so much more than just 1%, because we're making this easier to buy. I see people talking in the chat, but the most important part about this, the most important part about what I wanted to talk about right now, and I'm going to keep reiterating what I just said, is when we get on these two new exchanges, we have ProBit and WhiteBit coming this week.

Then we have Bittrex and Bitmark coming in contractual meetings, where we're going to be working with them. It's, again, day 30. You guys understand when we get on exchange, when we get on these two exchanges, ProBit and WhiteBit, all there is going to be is buy volume, because it's new exchanges, and buy orders have to come in when these exchanges happen.

That's just what happens. They come in, because when you get on a new exchange, people that are getting on can't sell. They can't just automatically sell, so you're going to see tremendous buy orders come in.

Do you know what buy orders do? It increases the price. It increases the number of holders.

It increases the market cap, and it increases the price of FJB. All I'm saying is take that for what you will. Take a step back.

If you're looking at the chart right now, we haven't even gotten on an exchange yet, and we have almost 7,000 holders. Can you imagine when we get all of the new buyers coming in, all of the new buy orders? It's going to be ridiculous.

I was actually thinking that this morning. I got off a phone call this morning, and I went to go get my car washed. I was like, you know what?

It's kind of crazy, because this week is going to be unbelievable. It's going to be absolutely unbelievable, because this thing is just getting started. It's really just getting started, and it's so unreal.

This first cattle and big black jiggy to jack, that name always cracks me up. The catalyst that we have coming, it's not like if you trade small caps, where it's like, ooh, they might have data or something like that. We're working on this thing, and we're trying to get it done, but imagine being in a small cap stock or mid cap like DWAC, and then the news comes out that Trump and Truth Media is involved, and it goes up 1,700%.

Just imagine being that. Imagine having that. That's the type of catalyst that we're working on.

[Speaker 2]
This is not a small catalyst. This is not like a minor thing.

[Speaker 1]
Message that to Fanboy. Fanboy is taking the blockchain media group, so you got that. You did.

Okay, I'll text him too, but we got you. Don't worry. Everybody, we're doing great.

Don't worry about it. Have a good one. I'll talk to you.
