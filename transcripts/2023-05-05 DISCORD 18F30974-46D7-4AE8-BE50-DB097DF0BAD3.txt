[Speaker 1]
All right, so it's been a good week. We have been approved to move forward. We have been waiting on the devs.

We have the agency that we're working with for the devs has a new lead dev for us than last time we spoke to them. So they're obviously in a different time zone. Just waiting on an email back from him and then we can start.

So super excited about that. Yeah, I'm glad I finally get to share that. I think it'll be great.

Again, do appreciate your patience through the process that we will be going through. Still don't expect anything overnight. I will keep you updated of anything major.

But yeah, I think the goal now is again, been for a while to do everything correctly, even if it takes more time. So, I didn't get the email. So yeah, that's where we're at there.

Hopefully from this point forward, everything will be moving fairly quickly. Or as basically as quickly as we're really just able to. That's it.

What are what were we waiting for and what is happening? We're waiting on approval for some changes from B&B. And now we are just waiting for the devs.

Once that is completed, we will keep you updated during that entire process. Once that is completed, we can move on to the rest of the roadmap. So yeah, super excited.

I know it took a lot longer than we expected. I do apologize for that. And I do appreciate your patience, as always.

I think the... I've got to open my Celsius.

[Speaker 2]
Unfortunately, not a beer, because I just got on meds today.

[Speaker 1]
So the devs are doing the name change, then you'll announce it. No. Wow, my drink's kind of warm.

I just got it out of the fridge. No, but we will be announcing that shortly also. The name change for the app.

What are the devs doing? We'll let you know as soon as that's completed. No pumping before name change.

Yeah, we're so... Remember that basically all the marketing we are holding off until we rebrand the app, because of the whole FJB deal. So we got devs again, is what you're saying?

We've had these same devs for a while. We were just waiting on B&B to approve some changes first. They initially did approve them, and then they got back and wanted to review everything and have a few more people review everything again.

So that took several weeks. But we're good. We are one step closer, and that's what's important.

I understand how frustrating it is, and we've missed timelines. Trust me, I'm right there with you. But the important part is we're still here.

Most other altcoins are not. Moving forward slowly sometimes, but surely we'd rather do it right. This time around, so I think that's great news.

So B&B have now approved the live update.

[Speaker 3]
Which one of the live updates is the main update?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, absolutely. Yes, we are just waiting on the devs now, so we'll be pretty excited. When McNifty and Nolan...

Actually, yeah, I just had a conversation not too long ago with the folks at McNifty. They're also just chilling out, waiting for the bear market to be over. So B&B have given total approval to move forward.

Yes, we're very excited for that. When do we declare bear market over? I'm not sure.

I know there's a few people, a few of you messaged me regarding the app transfers not going through, etc. We hope to have those resolved very soon, since the devs are back on. I will be awake during opposite hours this weekend to make sure we get that all started.

At what point will they speak to us? That hasn't changed from the last call. Boris wants these changes to go through.

Then once we get there, we will discuss that. I want nothing more than for them to come on and speak to you all. And I'm sure they'd like to, too.

Close to roadmap being released. We are one step closer. How soon will you be walking out on us?

Excuse you, I've been here since day two. I don't know who else is still here from day two. I'm not sure, actually.

Where's the lesbian? Who's the lesbian? Who are you, tickle my fancy?

Oh, MJ's the lesbian? Liquid? Oh, everybody's claiming to be the lesbian.

Oh, boy. What day is considered day two? Day two of, uh...

What was that?

[Speaker 2]
October... Was that in the 20s? Was that in October?

[Speaker 1]
Day two of version one. You said the main update would take the devs a week or so back in March. Is that still the case?

I have asked our lead dev that we were assigned to early this morning that question. As soon as I hear back from him, I will let you know. I want to make sure that it's the same answer that the other devs gave us.

But if not, it's really not a big deal as long as we're moving forward. Excited to be moving forward and excited we have the funds to do so. I will be a lesbian if it's needed.

Wait, then we can't have babies. What the hell? No.

Not Finn. Finn's a man. Did we get the green light from B&B?

Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, thanks, Romeo.

[Speaker 1]
Will you be getting the new butt tattoo? I will not. I'm sorry to disappoint.

My mom would kill me. I guess she doesn't have to find out, though. Weg should, though.

Let's see if Weg will.

[Speaker 3]
I'm sure Weg will have no problem.

[Speaker 2]
You guys trying to get me killed by my mom? Or what?

[Speaker 1]
Diesel guy. I don't know what the same things are, but sometimes I do want to make an alt so I can see what Diesel's saying. What's the news?

That we did get approval. We got assigned to a new lead dev as of yesterday. He got back to me today, so we're just waiting on him to see how long this process will take.

Do we have all the funds we need for the next phase? We have all the funds we need for the foreseeable future. I don't see that being a problem right now.

Is this thing going to be better? Hey, that's what we're working on. I think as long as we're moving forward, I think we're doing much better than we were before.

It might not look like it, looking at the charts, but I think it's important to recognize that we did have people pumping the charts and dumping the charts to skew and show some volume there, along with the hype, voice chats, and all that. I understand it's not as exciting as it once was, but I think it is important to recognize that. What names are running now?

I'll update you on the names as soon as that's completed. Like I mentioned before, we're not trying to be secretive. Just in the past, like last time we rebranded, we had people trying to sell us the domains for $100,000, I think.

A few people in here got alts and then wanted $100k for a domain, so we just don't want a repeat of that. Hopefully that's understandable. Now that we have approval, can you talk about what's going to be done moving forward?

I'm assuming you're talking about the changes, which we will share with the community as soon as they're completed. What do you think of the new name? Is it going to be helpful?

I do believe that a huge reason why we weren't getting approved anywhere, even on conservative sites, is the whole FJB. So I think that'll help tremendously. Sarah, take a shot.

I can't, I'm on meds. I know, I got super sick yesterday, so I'm drinking the Celsius Peach Vibe sparkling white peach edition. It's pretty good, but it's not cool.

I usually put these in the freezer, because I like my drinks super cold. I didn't do that, so it seems warm even though I just got it out of the fridge and it's in a koozie. When next mentioned on War Room?

I've been told as soon as we have our stuff together. But of course we'll keep you updated on that. Are we ever going to connect this dumb coin?

Excuse you! I will not tickle your fancy. Or the election?

That is the goal. We'd love to use FJB to help. Whoa.

Okay, no, not that. Elections, yes. Deadline for newly developers?

Setting a deadline on estimated completion. Hopefully by the end of the weekend. We literally just got assigned to him, so I've not heard back from him yet.

Who did you use to be? What does assigned to new developer mean? We're going through this, I don't know if I would say agency.

But they had us assigned to somebody else before. That's been several weeks since we last got our first approval. So when I did message AllMyDaysAreTogether either yesterday or the day before, they assigned us to somebody different.

So a different lead developer than the one we had before. Who chose this? So it was the agency that was actually chosen through our committee.

[Speaker 2]
That was Juan's.

[Speaker 1]
Shying away from FJB. Yeah, I do understand where you're coming from. However, if we went months and months and months, because even Trump doesn't want FJB at his rallies.

I mean, some of the biggest names, Mike Lindell, nobody really wants, even concerts don't even want FJB. I think at some point, I understand where you're coming from, but at some point, I feel like a little bit smarter to change that. And our coin is still FJB.

Are there any more approvals you're waiting on, or have the bees and their advisors all been satisfied and given total plan approval? No, we're literally waiting on the devs to give us a time, how long this is going to take to complete, how early he can start, when it will be completed. Is the agency a crypto developer, collective, or traditional headhunting development placement agency?

I don't have that right now, but they specifically, the guy we have, the lead dev, specifically is a crypto developer. Does Web3 and blockchain.

[Speaker 2]
Type it in words, please, I'm not listening. No, wag, shush.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, so is the new name, is it already chosen, you just can't reveal it yet, or is it still being decided on? The new name is about 90% decided on. Okay, awesome, so today's a great day then.

Yes, absolutely, it's been a great week. How much of the funds will this take, and will you need to sell some to fund? I don't think we need to sell anything right now, but I think we'll know more details shortly.

We want to make sure that we get the same answers from the new dev that we did before. How can I commit to a tattoo if a name, I don't know, wag, you have no choice, just, it's fine, you've committed to us. What will cause the price of FJB coin to rise if usage of the app under a different name is what will be marketed?

Because we will still be selling the gift cards at these booths. Will any smart contracts created for this project be open for third-party integration? I'm not sure what that means, but I can ask.

Is this guy from Kazakhstan? Who's that? FJB tiny little ads.

Okay, so FJB coin on the app are effectively different projects at this point in a business sense. They're still operating under the same LLCs, if that's what you're asking. And the FJB coin gift cards will still be sold at the apps.

I think it's just, you know, we're just putting the app name. That'll be what's on the banner and the booths and any merch. And we're just going more of what, you know, we're pro this versus FJB.

Pro everything we are. Pro USA, pro guns, pro God. Pro freedom.

I was hoping to hear that fees from the app would be paid in FJB. How does the dev identify? We'll get a tat if she reveals name right now.

I'd be more likely to send you a pic than reveal the name. No, he was Ukrainian. Who are you guys talking about?

We need a dev that identifies as fast and efficient and good and works more than two hours a day. Yep, I agree with that. Absolutely.

Who's the Ukrainian dev? I don't know. Anyway.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. Let's see what Tyler does in India.

[Speaker 1]
Is there a way for us to invest directly in the app itself as opposed to what seems to be an isolated, although related, project? Not right now, but as you all have seen, we've had a ton of changes in the past, so anything is possible at this point. And, yeah, FJB coin, I would say, is an isolated project.

[Speaker 2]
Create an app coin and give every FJB holder one coin. When will the community get to see the presentation?

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, that's a good idea. What's the purpose of FJB coin at this point? I don't see how that's changed.

Oops. The coin is always connected to the app. Correct.

All we're doing is changing the name of the app to, and the reason we can't change the name of the coin is because then we would lose our listings on LBank and XT because they want the entire three listing fees if we change the name. Let's go Brandon or the FJB.

[Speaker 2]
I think some people in here are thinking their coins will be dead and the app will be a new thing.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, yeah, that's definitely not the case. Weak answer. Constructive criticism.

Have a better answer for that, please. I'm sorry you feel that way. This is what, so change, again, we've gone through this several times.

So we went to, we looked into changing the name of the coin because we, well, FJB, we all, I mean, that's how long is that going to last, right? But the fact that even people like Mike Lindell or Trump don't really want to be associated with FJB. So XT and LBank, too, even though with our explanations and reasoning, still, you know, which is understandable, I get it from their perspective, want complete relisting fees of 50 to 70k a piece, I believe.

50 to 60k a piece. So we would lose our listings, which are pretty valuable at this point. So for now, changing the name of the app would get us into events because we can use that name as far as, you know, going on our banners, going on our applications, and then we'd still be selling our FJB coin gift cards.

[Speaker 2]
So that's, I think, again, we've gone through that several times. And we will keep making changes as we see fit.

[Speaker 1]
We can't make them all at once. Obviously, if we had the funds to, we would easily change the name of the coin and pay that 110, 120. Been in finance for over 30 years.

I've stressed this over the years here and got my head tore off from begging you to get BNB to take 10% of all tax and use it to buy back coin and burn them till the coin gets down to 10 million. As the coin goes up, there becomes less resistance and it's easier to buy a bunch here. As it's cheap, this brings a ton of value to us who have been here since the first week.

This really needs to be addressed. That's 10 billion. Not million, sorry.

You kept saying you'll have something better than the burn. Can we know yet? I mean, I think a lot of that was in the roadmap.

But I think that'll be apparent as the changes are announced. The upcoming changes that were just approved. It really helps the coin go up and hold value with all the transactions down here.

It would lead up to the coin cheap. You said Trump doesn't want FJB at rallies. Has he had consideration with the changes moving forward?

Is he involved at all? No, he is not involved at all at this point. But I know at least rallies, I'm not sure if they're different anywhere else, but I know at least rallies he's had here in Arizona, he has not allowed any FJB into his rallies.

Zero in a series? No. You get why this helps the coin for a long-term era like us.

So what are the next steps? Timeline from devs and then when will changes be announced and when can we expect positive price momentum? Yes.

So we get a timeline from devs when they can start and then get that started, completed, paid, shared with the community. And when can we expect positive price momentum? I think that will happen as we fix the app and slowly start marketing.

You said the purpose of FJB has not changed. What has the purpose of FJB been? We could check out the white paper, that's what it was meant to be, but a lot of that has not changed.

So all we're doing is adding a few purposes. I mean this sincerely as a stated purpose has changed multiple times. I don't think the white paper has changed multiple times.

Okay, don't argue with each other. You guys could yell at me, but please don't argue with each other. Go ahead and take it out on me, that's fine.

Stop it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop it.

All right, this is where... Stop it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my goodness, you guys. Stop it.

[Speaker 1]
Please do not go at each other. If you'd like to yell at anybody. What the F?

No, stop. Are you trying to get us banned off Discord? What is wrong with you guys?

Oh my goodness. No one saw that. Yeah, because I deleted it.

What is wrong with you guys? Oh my goodness. Stop it, please.

Stop booting people. Stop... Yeah, exactly.

Chill out. I know it's been stressful, but please chill out. We are moving forward.

I understand it's not as quickly as we'd like. But please, just chill out. So the app was, is financed off of FGB buyers.

And the app name will change to promote, but can't promote FGB coin on the same level. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay.

Hold on. Flute, did you ban Nolan? Can you please unban him?

Stop. You guys. And I'm not even drinking.

My goodness. This is... He's not able to, he's not able to join the server.

Okay, hold on. Let me, okay. So the app name will change to promote, but can't promote FGB coin.

No, that is not true. The app name is just changing so we can better get applications filled out. And we can have prettier banners that don't say FGB.

So we can be allowed at events and have merch that says other things other than FGB. You know, other than, rather than fuck Joe Biden, we want to be pro, you know, everything we are. Pro-freedom, pro-God, pro-USA, pro-everything we are.

So, no. That is false. But can't promote FGB coin on the same level.

False. Yes. Do not want to give up exchange listing now to change FGB name.

I say to rip the band-aid and change both to promote both and give the people that finance the whole thing hope. Okay, so we can keep the, keeping the exchange listings. Those are valuable, so we are keeping those.

Especially once we start growing, there is a lot of users that are going to be using LBank, XT. A lot of people already into crypto. That's why that's valuable.

We will. Flute. Stop it.

You guys, please stop. Why, why is it showing expired on his end? Hold on.

I'm sorry, Bob. I'm sorry, Bob. The kids are going crazy.

Okay, rip the band-aid off. Sorry, back to that. So, as soon as we do have the funds, that, we've done that, I mean, we've done that tens, multiple tens of times over, right?

110, 120k has not been a problem paying before. We could do that again with no issues as soon as we get some volume going. I don't think that will be an issue at all.

Again, as long as we're moving forward and as long as we're getting organic growth, I don't think that will be an issue. You know, we've mentioned this before, it's not going to be smooth sailing the entire time, but as long as we're still alive and as long as we're still moving forward, and at this point, I really don't think anything is going to kill this coin. I think we'll do great.

LBank, XD, etc. are very important. I agree.

Sarah, in all seriousness, I've been in finance and IT for 20 years. Can I see the fakies? What, what is, what is the, what is this?

I don't know. What are you talking about? One solution is giving every FJB holder one token of new app for each FJB token they hold.

You have 10 million FJB, you get 10 million new app. Wait, wait, wait. The new app does not have a new coin.

We do not have a new coin. This is still the coin connected to the app. The coin is connected to the app.

If the app goes up, the coin goes up. Okay, no one's back. I understand making a coin.

Hey, we're, any, we're not... This is, this is what I'll say. It's, we're, I think at this point it's clear we've gone through so many changes.

A little, you know, as long as we're moving forward, baby steps, let's get this, let's get this completed first, then we can move from there. We're always happy to hear your ideas. Luke, stop.

Stop. That's what I was asking about. What ties the value of FJB to the app?

That, I mean, that hasn't changed what tied the value before. That's what I was saying earlier. People think their coins will die and the app will be a new thing.

Yeah, that's not... What? What is up with you guys?

Settle down. Yeah, I'm not sure that's what we'll be selling at booths is still the FJB gift cards along with the merch. We're just marketing it a lot differently.

That's it. That's, it's no more, no less than that. We are, there is not going to be some new coin.

We're just marketing it differently until we can get an official name change. Mad coin, make America great, great American exchange app. I don't know about that.

What does the news progress mean for the roadmap? Is it still on schedule? Will we meet all quarter two goals?

I'm waiting on the dev. It is about 5 a.m. his time right now. I've not heard back from him out of the rainbow.

My mind is all over the place. I think this is what happens when I drink an energy drink. So I think once we, since the ball is in the dev's court now, we will wait on that before we move forward.

The main things we have on the agenda right now is getting that big task completed and also the rebranding of the app. The rebranding of the app is very important because from there we can start a lot of the education. We can start a lot of the how-to videos and a lot of the troubleshooting videos and FAQs.

Since we want to put in whether it's a video or screenshots, I think it'll be important to wait until the rebranding is completed to get those done. I think that'll help save us a lot of time, not only in my DMs, but a lot of you who help people coming in who kind of have the same issues. Rebranding clever, Jrock.

[Speaker 2]
You might know me as Turdcoinactivist or just a turd.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Still don't know who you are.

[Speaker 1]
What I'll do is I'll just make Bernard a mod too and then you guys can just keep banning and kicking each other. See, money, you're not allowed to tell me what's a good or bad idea. Anymore.

I know you don't, Nolan. That's what made it so funny. Any news on Boris getting stolen funds back?

No. Honestly, that is not very high on my priority list right now. Don't take that the wrong way.

It's just not on there. We're just trying to move along with this task right now so we can move forward. But I'll keep you updated.

Are we now officially saying that the funds were stolen? I have not said the funds were stolen, but... But you just did.

No, I was reading a question. Ah, mod cage fight. Hop into the Lunar Eater.

All-time high by September. I'm going to say it. The funds were stolen.

Just reading, folks. Where is Redis?

[Speaker 3]
Redis.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, and he added bacon and cheese. For some reason I thought Redis was a vegan.

[Speaker 2]
Gosh.

[Speaker 1]
Was Grant banned? No, he was not. He kept coming in and out, though.

Checking the welcome channel. Oh, were you talking to me? Oh, nice.

So I'm just stuck here forever. Okay. Actually, you've caught me.

This is why I've stayed. For some reason I'm still not in the same talk, but thank you. I'll take it.

Thank you. I appreciate it. Still don't know who Tickle My Fancy Please is, but I'll take the nice...

without creepy. Fear gets involved, things get bad. What assets will be treated in the app forward?

Are we still staying pretty tight to Matic? I'll update you. Actually, I think we'll have a call with somebody a little bit more knowledgeable.

A lot more knowledgeable.

[Speaker 3]
On the tech side of that. And you guys can ask all those questions. What in the world?

[Speaker 1]
True story. What is wrong with you? Were you drunk?

[Speaker 2]
Is that porno guy still involved? Yeah, actually I spoke to him a few weeks ago. Still doing pretty well.

Super nice.

[Speaker 1]
I just hate Wells Fargo. I hate Bank of America, so...

[Speaker 2]
Probably most of us hate Wells Fargo.

[Speaker 4]
What?

[Speaker 2]
Lucky Bernard has a dog picture, so we can just assume he's speaking for his dog and not being R.

[Speaker 1]
Kelly-ish. I need to know who Tickle My Fancy is.

[Speaker 2]
Somebody get in the... Oh, gosh.

[Speaker 1]
What happened to the Jan- Oh, gosh. Don't start that. Don't start.

It'll probably come back. Jana hated me. And she hated Lauren, too, though.

So I think maybe she just hated females. Oh, and Raven. I think she just hated all the females.

But it was a man, wasn't it? I think it was a man that turned into a woman. She bans me once, you got me reinstated.

Oh, who were you? I banned her, actually, or him, whatever, a few times. It's the most satisfying thing ever.

Gender. Gender is fluid. Eh.

I don't think there's any requirements. You're welcome to jump on if you'd like.

[Speaker 2]
Anybody's welcome to jump on. Any possibility to get Jobot on a voice?

[Speaker 4]
Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
I just saw that, uh... GIF you posted. Drew used to always post that.

Have fun. Tickling your own fancy.

[Speaker 3]
Are you turning taxes off during the summer? I don't know why. Like, for a weekend?

Or...

[Speaker 2]
For the season? I'm not sure about the season, but we can definitely do, like, weekends.

[Speaker 1]
But you guys can always purchase off LBank next to you, you know that. With zero taxes.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that does look nice.

[Speaker 1]
For POS and business outreach, is the intent to focus on a specific region of the country? Right now, the plan is to start visiting just more conservative, prominent areas with just larger populations. But no, we're not starting...

We're not, like, focusing on a specific, like, we're not only starting in Arizona or starting in Florida or anything like that. So, we'll just be traveling through and starting out that way. Hoping the name change makes that go a lot smoother.

[Speaker 3]
Through businesses, concerts, rallies, political rallies, colleges, universities.

[Speaker 1]
Just leaked app name. What? I don't get it.

Why are you laughing?

[Speaker 2]
That's so funny. What am I missing? Oh, God, live, laugh, love.

[Speaker 1]
I can say I never had one of those. Will merchants have the same tax levied on them and thus contribute to the tax wallets, or will there be an alternative scheme applied? There will be an alternative.

We have not completely decided on that yet. Also, I think it was one of the guys in Telegram who recently brought it up, and I know we've discussed it a long time ago when we first brought up gift cards, was actually having gift cards be sold by merchants and them receiving a percentage of any gift cards they sold. So, we're just working out the details of that because of the way our gift cards work.

But that also would be a neat idea. I do have all of your ideas saved from Discord and Telegram.

[Speaker 2]
What degree of interest do decision-making stakeholders have in using FJV as a political fundraising tool? Uh, not sure I can answer that right now.

[Speaker 1]
Not, like, being secretive, but... Not being secretive at all.

[Speaker 2]
Sounds like a secret. No, not at all. Gosh, it's only 5.30. I have a hockey game at, like, almost 10. I don't think I'll be able to make it. But Telegram, but Telegram's moving a lot faster.

[Speaker 1]
Are there institutional investors or bigger money players sitting on the sidelines, or are we relying on grassroots at this point as a proof of consent? At this point, we are relying on grassroots. I personally, this is complete opinion, from everything...

I don't know. I've just gathered from B&B, I think, as soon as we have everything, all of our stuff together. And as soon as we get on War Room.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think we'll be moving a lot quicker. As soon as we can prove we're not a huge mess with our funds just disappearing.

[Speaker 3]
But yes, grassroots for now, which I don't think we'll have a problem with. We've done that before, and we've raised a ton of money before. That could have done a lot of grassroots marketing.

[Speaker 1]
I think that'll be really important to get our app 100% functional.

[Speaker 3]
There's a little bit of slow growth, a little bit. All right.

[Speaker 1]
Anything else?

[Speaker 2]
I think that's all. I'm going to go get some In-N-Out.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry guys, I don't usually celebrate Senko Demayo here. As usual, please do not share your seed phrase with any mods or anybody, any other users, including me, or any kind of support. Nobody will ever ask you for your seed phrase.

Also, don't enter it into any strange links. Feel free to DM me or any of the other admins if you need anything. I think that's all.

Thank you all so much. If you are going out, be safe tonight. I will talk to you soon.

Have a good night.
