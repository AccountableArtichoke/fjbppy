[Speaker 1]
Hello, happy Tuesday, sorry give me a second, trying to get my wires all detangled here because I don't, I don't do airpods, you shouldn't either, if any of you do that. Okay, happy Tuesday, I don't have any huge updates, so I do apologize for that, however I think from now, starting this week or the next, yeah, like next voice chat Friday, I think I'll start making announcements for the voice chats, just so when we do have our big voice chat, you know, it won't be so obvious when it is, all right, so as far as updates go, devs are, they expect to have fixed the failed transactions in the next 24 hours, so that's the timeline they're giving me right now, I will keep you guys updated, it seems like BNB transactions are working fine, everything but the Ethereum, so I will keep you updated as far as that goes, as far as the review, we are waiting on our original dev for something there, but this week has been awesome, we've been working with, thank you Velo for being so helpful, that's been great, so yeah, everything's been going very well, everything, most everything for the event on Saturday is ready, at least the most important components, anything else that doesn't come in now, we can easily grab at the store, I'll just have to leave my house, yeah, I think that's everything, it's been a lot of, just a lot of work on the back end as far as printed materials, promotional material, we should have a five-figure kind of event in December, once that's 100% secure, I'll update you all on that, our merch, our PatriotPay merch did come in, however, the graphics were like half the size they were supposed to be, so they're taking those back, but we have some other shirts from a local printer, they won't be PatriotPay, but it'll get us through the event, yeah, along with, I forgot about the candy this morning, I freaked out because I ordered most everything where I thought, and then I thought about the kids that'll be at the event, for Saturday, so I ordered a bunch of patriotic kind of candies for the kids and then for the adults, so that should be coming in either today or tomorrow, too, I'm very excited about that, kind of excited to see what people's questions are and stuff like that to kind of help us gauge, just because then we're not so much in the echo chamber, you know, but I'll keep you updated on that.

As far as questions, I did see a few DMs earlier, okay, what's the status of the review? We are still waiting on our original dev for some input, they don't want to change anything that he, they want to make sure they're all on the same page, when you have different devs, and you need to have different devs, you know, you don't want your auditing dev to be the one who actually developed the specific code, so they're just going back and forth on some details right now. All right, and I will keep you updated on that if I have any big updates before the next voice chat.

What else? That's all the questions, I think all the next ones pertain to the same exact thing, which is the review. Were the files you received from Velo needed for the app or the task?

Essentially for both, to help both run as well as we'd like them to. Have the devs been able to successfully use those files? Yes.

What's the issue that will prevent task reveal in October? Just waiting for the devs to go back and forth and make sure that the auditors are not changing anything that shouldn't be changed. I just hope, you know, that there's not miscommunication between the different teams of devs, if that makes sense.

Will task reveal be in November? To be completely honest, right now it's looking like it, just because, again, we're waiting on our original dev of the task, not Velo. Is Patriot Pay segment launch scheduled on War Room during November?

No, that's the way War Room works. I mean, a lot of, at least all the slots that I've been aware of that we got with Bannon have been on the fly. Like, we got rescheduled many a times.

They are so busy and their schedule is so crazy that they generally move stuff around till the last minute. However, I am working on something from B&B to get to you all. I think that's everything in Telegram.

As far as Discord goes, I don't know, you guys are asking me for info, but the Discordians, is that what it's called? So I think most of your DM's in there. I just can't answer, guys.

If you have coins on XT, please contact me with your XT email so I can get those unlocked for you so you can transfer them out. You will not see your FJB coins in XT because we got delisted. So again, if you have coins on XT, or you think you did, or you know somebody who did, send me your XT account email so I can go ahead and send it.

Or you can contact XT support yourself if you don't want to share that info and let them know that you got delisted and you just want to transfer your FJB coins out. Please do that. There are still plenty of coins on there.

Go ahead and get those transferred off, please. The same with Wire, I think it was this morning or yesterday, somebody told me they still had a few hundred dollars with Wire. If you do still have funds with Wire, go ahead and contact them so they can go ahead and send you those funds.

I think the latest you have is the beginning of December, so I would do that ASAP. They also have a chat function on their website. I'm pretty sure they still have that, so you can chat with them there.

I know when I did it, gosh, it's been probably a year, year and a half ago, it was fairly quick. But please do that. If you do need any help with either of them, let me know so we can get you taken care of, so you can get your funds.

Because before it's too late. We can't help you once it's too late. So again, please do that ASAP.

I don't know what else. Getting closer as far as the app change goes, the LLC trademark. Just all the paperwork there, which is not very exciting.

Printed material, almost done there. I think you guys will love how everything looks. Super clean.

It's like the new thing. It's like very clean, but it still looks kind of 90s. I like it.

I kind of like it. I think you guys will love that. Oh, I don't think we'll have our table, like our custom tablecloth ready, or our custom banner ready before Saturday.

So those will just be plain. A nice red table cover, that's appropriate. And then our white tent, which actually just came in today.

I think stickers should be here Friday. So that'll be good. At least the quickest stickers we can get for now.

Let's see. I think as far as everything goes, I'm really hoping the app bail transactions are fixed. Again, task is not depending on it, but that would be amazing.

And I think it would be ideal.

[Speaker 2]
Let me see.

[Speaker 1]
Questions in chat. Okay, so is Velo helping? Because we needed some files from Velo.

Yes, he has been very helpful. I think he's very excited to come back in here and chat with you all. So don't be afraid to say hi to him.

Velo's always been very, very nice. That has definitely been a constant. So do you think the second review will start this week?

I honestly couldn't tell you right now. When I have more info on that, I'll let you know. When we fork, will we keep the same amount of coins and burn coins as we do right now to not scare the existing holders into selling?

I'm not sure how that would scare the existing holders into selling, but not worried about anybody selling. Of course, we'd love you all to stay and join us on our future... I don't know what word I'm thinking, but yeah.

That will decide when we get there, basically. If we made more coins, it would devalue our coins into selling. Yeah, I'm not really sure.

That's not my area of expertise. That's the crypto guys. But once we get there, I'm not sure.

I'm sure we'll be able to share more info on that. I really wanted a glass of wine today, but I was too lazy and running out of time. So it's a margarita.

I really like those. If anybody drinks margaritas or likes strong ones, they're like pre-made ones, which usually I do. I hate pre-made drinks, but they come in little glass bottles.

I can't think of a brand off the top of my head, but if you don't like super sweet, you'd like them. What does the rest of this week hold? Will audit one be completed by Friday?

I don't have an answer on when the audit will be completed, just because that really depends on the devs, the dev team that developed it and the dev team reviewing it. But I will keep you updated. Would you please repeat what you said about Velo before?

That he sent us the files this week? Somebody asked if he's working on everything or what we needed from him, something like that along those lines. When I said Velo, I think he's definitely excited to be back in the chats and to be holding FJV.

No, Velo is not back on the team. He is not working on blockchain anymore. He is working on more AI stuff.

He was telling me about some really cool things, some really cool things and ideas. Wow, I think my dog just tooted. Yeah.

So, he's working on some really cool stuff that he, actually, a lot of really cool stuff, seems like it. It seems like he's in a really awesome place. Do we still have the dev split up between Smart Wallet and Task?

Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, yes, yes.

I think that's everything. Again, please don't forget to move your funds off XT, off Wire before it's too late. Once it's too late, we cannot help you.

We can't do anything about it once it's too late. Wire has a hard deadline beginning of December. I'm trying to remember.

Let me see. I have it up here. I want to say it was December 3rd, but don't quote me on that.

It's been quite the week. Also, my cousin, my 23-year-old cousin, passed away in her sleep this weekend of a stroke. Perfectly healthy.

No drugs, no alcohol, no medications. So, that's wonderful. Definitely stay healthy.

Let me see. I'm trying to find the Wire email they sent out. They should have sent you one out, but I know mine went to junk.

Okay, so here we go. It is, okay, December 3rd. You have, yep, I was right.

So, you have this till December 3rd to get your funds back. Make sure you do that with and then XT. Although they've not given us a hard date, it does not mean they don't have one in mind.

So, again, please get your funds off there. They're still, I'm not sure how much you all have in Wire. We're not exactly on great terms with them, but if you need anything from them, let me know.

I can still try to take care of you there. As far as XT goes, they have been very helpful getting everybody's funds off there. Again, a ton of coins still on there.

Please get them off and let me know if you need help doing that. Just because they haven't given us a hard date doesn't mean they have one, and I just don't want it to be too late for you all because then we cannot help you. I bought through the app with the Wire.

Yes, I think the majority of people with Wire, as far as I know, got their funds. However, like I said, somebody within the last 24 hours told me they still had a few hundred dollars with them, so definitely contact them before December 3rd. I know from contacting Wire before, they kind of forward you to a ton of different departments.

I'm not sure if that's still the case since they're closing down, but it may take a while, so keep that in mind, please. Yeah, if you have your coins on the app, you should be fine. I think a few people just had mishaps and things got lost on the way, and not everybody got their deposits and pending transactions and just different things happened there on that day.

But I think that's everything for now. Goodness. If you all have any businesses that you would like us to reach out to, feel free to send those over.

So we can go ahead and reach out to them. But other than that, I think that's all I have. Again, we're definitely moving forward.

Yeah, I'll keep you all updated again if I have any updates before Friday, or just tell Sam to ask. I feel bad when Sam asks. I feel like I can't not answer him.

But no, if I have any important information before Friday, I will definitely let you know, and then from now on, I will probably start posting about the voice chats like that morning or say 24 hours in advance. So when I do that on Friday, don't be alarmed or think it's the voice chat. I don't want to false hype anything, but I think from now on, I will start doing that just to not make it so obvious once we are finally ready.

So keep that in mind. I will mention it in the announcement I make, and I'll mention it in the voice chat notes today too, just so you all have a heads up in case you don't listen to these. But right now, there's no way we would be done and ready by this Friday.

So again, that's just what I'll start doing for voice chats. Sam's so nice. I feel like Sam's so harmless.

But yeah, that's everything. Thank you all for taking care of some of the users that come in here with technical issues. I know TrustWallet had some issues today.

I'm still having issues because I'm trying to connect through Wallet Connect, and I don't have a direct wallet address to pay some of them. So, oh, so our price will be a little off in the app. Well, FYI.

Until I hear back from them, they should be getting back to me when I said we're done 24 hours. So let's see about that. Yeah, I think that's everything.

I'll post to the voice chat and notes. I am very excited about finally getting the LLC and trademark wrapped up, so we can change that app name and logo. Our email is also changing around a little bit as we switch websites and servers.

So keep that in mind. I'm still checking everything but keep that in mind. Also, if you DM me and I don't respond to you that day, definitely tag me, please, especially on Telegram.

A lot of it, we get so many spammers. Most of those messages go to my archive chats, and I do check those regularly, but I think sometimes they get, I'll miss a few if I don't recognize the names. So, Simon.

Welcome, Simon. I think a lot of interesting names lately. Okay.

Well, let me know if you guys need anything else. In the meantime, as usual, don't share any of your info, seed phrase, or click on any weird links. Obviously, Trust Wallet updated their apps.

That logo is going to look a little bit different, but just be very wary of that, or me and the admins sending you any DMs. We will not message you first. If you're ever in doubt, please say so in the general chat. It's a lot easier for all of us to help you in there.

That way, you're for sure, it's not a spammer. I'll be better safe than sorry. Just because I don't want you all to lose your coins now, I think that would be a very, very bad time for that to happen.

Trust Wallet scared the shit out of all of us today. Yeah, I know. I logged in and it was as I was making, I forget what, oh, the devs were testing some stuff.

So, I definitely freaked out, especially with all the logo changes they have going on. Not sure how I feel about it yet, but I think like Sam says, a lot of stuff, sometimes we don't like it in the beginning, but then you get used to it. I stole my seed phrase, oh my gosh.

Yeah, if you are local, hit me up so I can give you the event info for this Saturday. I'm very excited about that. Like I said, they said last year they got a few thousand people show up, so it should be a fun event.

Again, I'm just curious to kind of see what questions the general public has. It'll be fun either way and give us some content for socials and stuff like that too. So, it'll be a nice test run for bigger events.

We're hoping to land in, well, a really, really big event later this year. So, we'll see how that goes. Yeah, I'll keep you guys updated if there's anything big or worthy before Friday.

Otherwise, I'm here. DM me or tag me or email me if you need anything. That's it.

I hope you all have a good night. I'll post this right now along with some type notes so you guys don't have to listen to the entire thing. I could take a collection to send some to be with you.

Wait, I don't get it. We will be giving FJB out too, so I think that'll be cool. I'm excited for that.

Someone at the event. Yeah, feel free to join anybody local or anybody wanting to do TPUSA in December. Go ahead and reach out to me there too, definitely if you're in the Phoenix area.

So, we all logo. True, some more fun logos than others. All right, guys.

I think that's everything I have. Thank you all very much. I'm very excited to do this all together.

[Speaker 2]
Have a great night.
