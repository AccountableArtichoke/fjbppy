[Speaker 2]
You've got to pump it up You've got to pump it up Don't you know, pump it up, you got to pump it up Hello, hello, hello, what's going on everybody?

[Speaker 3]
You guys miss me or what? Can you guys hear me loud and clear? Let's hear it, let's hear it, let's hear it.

Is Ryan in the house? I think I, I think I hear it. Alright, whoa.

[Speaker 1]
My computer's acting a little bit funky, but it's alright. My Discord's acting a little strange. Everybody's names are different colors.

Did somebody change the colors of the names? Because they were definitely different like five minutes ago.

[Speaker 3]
But, huh, did somebody change the names? They seem green, right? Everybody, yeah, okay, so I'm not colorblind.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if I went colorblind overnight or something. But like five, I think ten minutes ago they were all red, but now they're green. Alright, what's up everybody?

Happy Wednesday. How we doing? Donnie did it.

You know what? Thank you, Donnie. St. Paddy's Day. I appreciate it. You're thinking ahead. You might have cracked too many Guinnesses today, but it's alright.

It's St. Paddy's Day, FJB app. Everything is great. Everything is great.

You guys are probably wondering what's going on. I know that's the number one question. That's the number one question that everybody is wondering.

Obviously, for obvious reasons, this has been basically Christmas that we've been waiting for. We've been waiting for this day. We've been waiting for the app to come out.

And I can assure you that this thing is going to be baller. The team is fantastic. It's unbelievable.

And with something as complex as this, I think a lot of people here do understand the complexity of it. I think they really understand that, hey, this thing is not easy to be done. It's not easy to finish.

The team has been working on this for three or four weeks now. I think just about four weeks. It's been like a 24-7 type of grind.

There's a lot of people behind the scenes working unbelievably hard on this thing. Unbelievably hard. That are in this Discord right now.

That are killing it. Doing everything in their capability and their power so that you guys here can see it in real time. So that you guys could reap the rewards of it.

And besides them, there's also a team of third-party developers included on that team. And I don't want to blame anybody or circumstances that may lie. The reason for the delay is there's a lot of rigorous testing that goes on.

Currently, they're testing the off-ramp. They're testing the selling aspect of it. So when you have your coins and you want to exchange them, the off-ramp type of testing.

It's not an easy process. And obviously, you want to make sure that everything is great before you release it. And I know some people have messaged this.

And they said, you know what, it's okay if we have a slight delay in the app. Because you don't want to go out and say the app is there when it's not 100%. And then have to retract your statement and say, actually, we have to test some more.

Because this didn't work. You want this thing to be full go. So then when the full marketing, the full push, the full everything goes out.

Everything is fantastic. Everything is working crystal clean. Because there's nothing worse than let's say we come out with the app.

And then 10,000 people want to get FJB coins. And they can't get them. It would be a lot worse, right?

Wouldn't it be? Because then let's say you delay it like that. And then they say, oh, actually, it's going to come out in a week.

There's going to be a lot of loss of trust. And I know that you guys all hear. There's 171 people listening here.

You guys are here listening. You guys have known that we've been bad with timelines. I don't think I've hit on one timeline.

But the great thing is, oh, Turok is here. I thought he had to teach a class. What's up, Turok?

Exactly. You might have to wait a few more days. I'm just saying from the beginning.

We're trying to be as transparent as often as we can. And trying to tell you everything. Update that comes in, I will send you guys away.

Whatever I hear, you guys will hear. It's going to be real time. So you guys know what's going on.

Currently, they're testing the sell side, like I said, of the off ramp of the app. There's going to be many iterations to this web app and iPhone slash Android phone app. There's going to be many iterations to this, which is going to be awesome.

You're going to see some different things. You're going to see different aspects of it. You're going to see different things that make it better.

Oh, what's up, Ryan? Ryan's in the house. How are you doing?

And you can see Barrel League posting. Delays should be very minimal. Absolutely.

Delays are going to be very minimal. The team is killing it. And part of the reason why there also have been some delays is one of the developers is actually in Kiev.

He's in Ukraine. And obviously, everything that's going on there is awful. And there's bigger fish to fry than work.

So trust me, he's still working. And that's the really awesome thing, which is incredible. He's still working, and he's still pushing through it.

But obviously, there's things that are going on in the external world that are bigger focus, as they should be. So a lot of different aspects, a lot of different moving parts going on with this, a lot of testing going on. Delays are minimal.

Delays were expected. It's not easy to do this. I know that people that work in software or in IT can probably attest to this.

If you ever try to make an app or even a website, there's websites that just get delayed, and websites are easy to make. It's easy to do so. It's easy to have delays.

There's a lot of things. And especially when you're anticipating a lot of people looking at it. Our web traffic is through the roof.

It's going unbelievable, especially look at it like this. We've been saying March 16th. Web traffic this past week has been believable, unbelievable.

So there's a lot of people that are checking it. They're refreshing it. I'm getting texts.

I'm getting DMs, messaging, saying they're refreshing the website. They're looking for it. They're waiting for it.

There's a lot of excitement around this. And trust me, the people that's involved in this, aka Boris and Bannon and Finn and Eric Finman, there's nobody better that can plan this type of thing. We have a tremendous team.

We have Ryan in here as well. We have so many people behind the scenes. We have Poso.

We have Bernie Carrick. We have all of these endorsers, too, like ready to go. They're all jacked up.

They're all absolutely unbelievably excited. Why do you think Ryan's still here? This has been how many months has Ryan been here?

We got Ryan in early November, and he's still here. Doesn't that go to show that we're here for the long haul? I've seen other coins, not going to name any names, that like to gather a lot of endorsers and then doesn't do that well for them.

We've stuck through all of this. If we can stick through all of this, we can stick through a couple more days, especially when everybody's so excited as you guys are because this community is the backbone of it. 177 people listening on a Wednesday night when I announced this voice session, what, three hours ago?

Discord? Exactly. Ryan said he's been busy.

Absolutely. This guy's tremendously busy. This guy's always on the road.

He always checks this chat. That's how important this thing is. FJB, Freedom Jobs and Business, we all know what it means.

We've all been here. It's like hearing me say it for the thousandth time, still so incredible because it's so important that we're all here. The same group of people that I've seen from the beginning still here with a lot of new faces to a lot of old faces on new faces.

We're all waiting for this. No, we are. We're all excited and jacked up about it.

The great thing is we're right at the door. We are so close. We are so unbelievably close.

Can't wait to give you guys any more updates. I can't wait for you guys to see this. More importantly, you're going to be like, oh, crap.

This is the real deal. And the best part about it is, too, it's going to be adapting. It's going to be moving forward.

There's going to be a lot of change going on. I know you guys just want to see it. So the team is working unbelievably hard.

I'll see if I can get any snippets of something I can send your guys your way by the by the end of the night. I know it's getting late here on the East Coast. I'll see if I can send anything your way so you guys can see something to get excited about.

But this thing is awesome. This thing is really awesome. You guys are even better.

Happy St. Paddy's Day. Thank you for changing the colors to green. That's a nice little touch.

I thought I was going colorblind. My computer was a little bit messed up. I couldn't differentiate who was a mod and who was just posting.

But I will update you guys with any updates that we have. The team sends me. I will send anything your way.

Like I said, transparency has always been here since the beginning with us. We want to continue to do so. Stay excited.

Stay pumped up. I love seeing the fact that we're trending on stock twits like randomly because you guys are unbelievable at that. And everything is fantastic.

Everything is great on our end. A little bit of patience. That's all you need in life.

And a little bit of patience and patience gets rewarded. This this has been a tremendous ride. And we're so close to the door.

So you guys can can see everything that the team sees. You can see the vision. I know you guys see the vision on on paper.

But you can really you can really see it to fruition very shortly. So stay patient. Everybody have a great day.

Patty's day. Be safe. Donnie, take it easy.

Cut back on the Guinness. Maybe mix in a water. Who knows?

You guys have a great night. Be safe. And eat a Frank.
