[Speaker 1]
All right, can you all hear me? Woohoo! Awesome, thank you.

MP, I did get your DM. I figured I would answer it on here since it would probably get asked anyway, so that's why I didn't get back to you. Happy Tuesday.

We are waiting for approval. However, I did get in contact with the devs and we are waiting on them to get started on some other things in the app this week, so as soon as they can start, I will let you know. Or you'll probably find out, but I'll keep you updated as soon as they're able to start.

I don't think it should be later than this week for sure. So that's good news right there. I did get a few questions.

Sorry, hold on. It's really warm. We're already in the hundreds here, so if you're anywhere cooler...

I am jealous. Okay, yes, I understand. Everybody is frustrated.

Can you tell us what is causing the current delay? That hasn't changed. We are waiting for B&B to approve a change that we really need to get done first.

This was initially approved, several weeks ago. Then they came back and said, actually, hold on, and now they've just had different people reviewing it. Who is the proposal sitting with and are you communicating with them?

Yes, our last contact was yesterday, late, pretty late in the day, and it is somebody from War Room, even though the change does not really have to do with War Room, if that makes sense. I know I've seen a few comments in the chat, like this means they don't have all the information they need, comments like that. That's not the case.

Yeah, they do have everything they need. I think just a mix of them being busy, them really trying to make everybody happy. Reiterating, guys, if you have issues, please do not go crazy on B&B.

Just you can feel free to... Hold on, somebody needs to be muted. Guess not.

Feel free. My inbox is always open. This is not to protect me by any means.

All the calls are recorded. All the chats are rolling. Everybody on the team has access to all of that.

This is more so really just to help things move along a little bit more quickly. Again, this is not saying this is your fault by any means, just kind of a little reminder. Also, what does approval mean?

Approval, it's literally just approving this one specific change. Are you waiting on approval for the project to continue as per the roadmap that has been presented? Yes.

Everything else has been approved. We're just waiting on this, and then we can move forward. Does this mean that nothing at all can happen until approval is granted?

No, we're going to start with a few other things that we've gotten the green light on while we wait for this. But again, by the end of the week, changes will start. If approval is not given, does this spell the end of the project?

No, not at all. I will make sure that changes are happening by the end of the week. Like I said, at this point, we're waiting on the devs, so the ball's on their court now.

Recording? Yes, I did. I'll make sure again that it is recording.

Yes, it is. Four minutes, 54 seconds. No, and B&B, I see B&B are the ones holding it up.

Again, I think the reason behind that is they really just want to make sure this isn't going to mess anything up and make sure nobody tries to go after them on getter or is unhappy and have a mob. They want to make sure they do right by all of you, and that's it. No more, no less.

What are the other things? Everything else on the roadmap, starting with some app changes. We're going to go along with those.

Have the devs start fixing things as long as those are things that we're not going to have to change again after the approved changes, if that makes sense. What expertise does War Room Person have for review? He is, I don't know if I can share that, but I know he helped B&B initially with the whole getting on boarded with FJB, and he does have a background in finance.

Are the devs the end-to-end team? Yes, that has not changed. Unfortunately, our other dev, Nomen, which was amazing, kind of just went MIA.

We really hope that he's okay, but even on his public profiles, he just completely went MIA. A little concerning, but we hope he's okay because he was amazing. I know you've said it so many times.

You're probably turning blue in the face. My reading is that B&B are still here and wanting this to go ahead, but are finalizing things for production and risk mitigation. Yes, absolutely.

B&B are very much here. They very much want to be involved. They are very much involved.

Boris specifically, since I think I've made it clear to everybody I speak to him way more than Bannon, he realizes we're in a bear market and he just realizes we have the time to get everything right. I would let you know if B&B were stepping away. I would 100% let you know if that were the case.

That is not the case. I hope not. Yeah, even on his public profiles.

It's not just like FJB related or that he blocked us or anything like that, so yeah, I'm not sure. What happened to the missing funds? I don't think we've discussed that for a few weeks now because honestly getting everything on the roadmap completed or approved has been more of a priority, but I will update you with any updates.

What is your gut feeling on time for approval now? I honestly could not tell you since we have one more person reviewing it, but I do again realize their reasoning behind having just one more person review it and one more person review it and one more person review it, which is why I am begging you all if you have any complaints or want to yell at anybody, please do it to me. Don't go after B&B.

They are busy enough. They have enough on their plate. They have done a lot for us and I think we're all on the same page where we all do want the same thing.

Once approved, how much work needs to be done before we get going? Once approved, it's on the devs and that changes with how busy they are, but when we checked with them last, they said they can get started within less than 48 hours, two days, and the changes would be fairly quick for that first change to take place. Again, this is not saying that would happen without Murphy's Law, you know, things will come up, but as long as we're moving forward, I think we're on the right page.

So get Jan to send the cards directly to you. Yes, I know. I saw two different ones of me.

I saw that on Discord. Somebody posted two of me and then one of Boris and one of Bannon. What the heck?

Why do I get two when I'm here the most? Oh, I saw Pierre asked a few questions and then tagged me because his lunch was over, I think. Because Jan loves me twice as much.

[Speaker 2]
Here we go.

[Speaker 1]
Mechanism for FJB holders. Lock LP tax-free. NFT support.

I did see that, I think, from the morning where you're talking about adding something to the website for social media. People get points based on tasks completed. Those points get totaled to determine what percentage of that pot each person gets.

So, with all of these, uh, and why everything else is pretty much on hold is we really need this approval to go through so we can get that out of the way and move forward with everything else. So, as always, love all your ideas. I promise I'm not ignoring them.

We just we need this approval to move through to go forward. B&B are very aware of this. And yeah, I mean, we can get going on everything else.

There's no, because otherwise we'd be, otherwise we'd be making um all these changes to have the devs or, you know, whoever is making a FAQ or the education portion or how to buy video or any of these things. Even with just the rebranding part, we'd have to redo all that over and that would get very expensive and that's why we have not. And that's why we're waiting on the approval.

Again, by the end of the week, and again, that would be the only thing there would be waiting for the devs. Um, yeah. Um, okay.

When it is decided to go live. When it is decided to go live, will we be able to have a voice chat with B&B to pump our dance and spirits? Um, I did discuss this with Boris the last time.

He said, let's get through these changes first and then we will discuss that. Um, but I am definitely pushing for that. That's another reason I say, please do not go out yelling at, you know, B&B on getter, uh, or Twitter or, you know, and Boris's emails.

Um, because I would imagine if it were me, I'd probably be less likely to come on. Um, what on the roadmap has been completed? Uh, we've been pretty much paused minus, uh, really planning.

Um, yeah. Is the roadmap still valid? Are Q2 bullet points achievable from this point in time and same for Q3?

Um, I, I think a lot, if not all of it will be, um, looking at right now, we do have the funds to definitely move forward with that. Um, and I think once we get the ball rolling, we should have no problem there. Um, but I just don't want to put any more time or estimates on that.

Um, I think we'll just better be able to answer that question when we get approved. Um, yeah. We need marketing for new holders, big wallets, keep buying, but there's more value in more holders, less chance for big dump.

Yes, absolutely. I agree. Um, yes.

Oh, thank you. Oh, shoot. I think I mixed him up all the time with Pierre.

One further question about the approval. Is it all encompassing or is it for individual tasks? Uh, so the approval is really getting one main task completed, but, um, again, it would just cost us a whole lot if we were to continue on and then have to go back for several reasons, but that being a big one.

There's a portal to go ahead and close. Forever close? What does that mean?

Need more exposure to get new holders? Yes, absolutely. How specialized?

Doesn't he live near you? Yes, he does live near me. I have not, uh, spoken to him.

I've not seen him either. I'm sure he's doing well. So approval can mean a couple of things.

Approval as it stands doesn't just mean approval for the project. No, not at all. Um, yes.

Approval is for a particular item within the project. Um, yeah, in no way, shape, or form is this approval for the project to move forward. Um, Boris, uh, yeah, has said time and time again that he realizes it's a bear market and, you know, everything's down and we have time, which I, trust me, I understand.

Um, I have a little bit more urgency like you all do, um, but just kind of understand it from that point of view versus, um, B&B no longer wanting to be involved with the project. If that were the case, I will be the first to let you know. If approval for one particular point isn't given, that doesn't mean B&B are not approving their involvement and progress?

Question mark. Uh, no, that's, that's not the case, um, but we will be moving forward. We will be getting approval.

That is, um, like I said, I, I understand where they're coming from and I hope everybody else kind of does, although I realize the frustration, uh, that comes with it. Um, yeah, they just want everybody happy, um, and want, you know, want to make sure that, that this is the best for the coin, the community, and new holders to continue growing the community. If approval isn't given, do we still move forward with the rest of them?

Approval will be given. Just kidding. Um, yeah, approval, approval will be given.

That's, that's, uh, approval will be given 100%. Um, do we still move forward with the rest of the roadmap? Uh, yes, absolutely.

In the event that it's not, uh, we do, however, um, approval will be given. We will make it. Raise your voice again.

Oh, yeah. Okay. That's actually what I was going to say.

Um, somebody, somebody messaged me after the last voice chat saying that they can't hear the voice, that my voice is really low on their iPhone. Um, I'm not sure why that is. Try to play the other file that I post, um, because, yeah, I played it on my iPhone and it wasn't, it wasn't very, very low.

So, either that or something up with your speakers. If approval will be given 100%, then why not start now? Um, because last time I shared something prematurely, y'all went after me.

So, so that's why. Put it in very little words. But you're going to move forward with the smaller things without approval.

Um, approval on smaller things, uh, how do I say this, I guess, um, the approval we're waiting on is just for the bigger item. Um, the point was to make it, uh, all go more smoothly that way. But if we're going to keep moving, um, then we're going to move on with the very minimum we can, um, even if that makes it more difficult and takes more time, uh, if that makes sense.

If we're waiting anyway, then may as well. That's all I'm going to say about that, Dallas. Uh, why hasn't that been happening for the last few months?

Because we did get approval and then two weeks later, I want to say give or take two weeks, I think it was more like a week and a half, they came back and said, uh, no, actually, hold off. Or maybe it wasn't half a week, I don't know, don't quote me on the time. But anyway, um, yeah, it was either a few days or a week and a half.

It's been so long now. Um, so yeah, and because it costs more and takes more time, the logic was, you know, that it would happen a lot more quickly, uh, if we waited for approval. But seeing it's taken so long, um, yeah.

Would you be surprised if you haven't heard feedback by the end of this week? Uh, I am, I am being very annoying this week. Um, so yes.

Still growing rapidly in 2023. Oh, I think we have, I think we have plenty of time and as soon as we get approved, I think we'll be moving forward very quickly, um, for as long as our debts and funds allow, which I think at this point is not a problem whatsoever. Um, again, this is not saying there won't be things that come up, um, but I think like we discussed in the last voice chat, um, that's kind of just asking for more of the community's patience and please don't go after B&B and make us kind of more of a liability.

Um, yeah, I think it'll be good. We have plenty of time. Um, yeah.

I am still very bummed at FJB, um, itself keeping us out of so many, um, even conservative events. Um, but yeah. Does there speak of a chain jump from, um, yeah, that's, that's been discussed several times.

Um, yeah, but I think we've also discussed the costs of getting back on the exchanges. Uh, I'll choose another 100k, 110, 120k, uh, just for L Bank and XT. Um, but we've done that and raised that much before with absolutely no problem.

Um, I don't think we'll have a problem doing that again with the funds being used appropriately. I don't think I can give any more hints because it's, I've given out too many even, uh, even indirectly, I think. So what?

Why are we yelling at Ed? He's a nice guy. Um, any chance of tax?

Yeah, so the only reason we stopped, um, selling tax-free from the tax wallets is just the, basically the negative impact that it has with the LP. So really for long term, uh, for the best interest of the coin and bidders, which is you. But we haven't been, um, selling anything either.

I haven't really needed, uh, needed to. Check on that right now. So tax-free buy, not sell.

Yeah, so, um, increase sell tax. Uh, tax-free buy, not sell. Yeah, so it's the tax-free buying, just the impact it has on the LP with that.

I mean, yeah, I get it keeping the charts up, but those funds aren't going towards the LP. So I would love a tax-free weekend to consolidate wallets. Why do you want to consolidate wallets though?

Probably better to kind of keep it spread out a little bit, no? Oh, is that what Ed is gonna be? Jealous.

Uh, oh, to move it to a hardware wallet. Okay, yeah, I think we've discussed that. Who's 20 and 24 on?

Um, we haven't missed anything really. DJT. I feel like it's a bunch of new people, but I don't know.

Yes, it's still the same guy from War Room, um, that we're waiting on. Our last contact was late, uh, last night. Well, late for them, not really for me.

Everybody else is on the East Coast. Pornhub, Pornhub blocks all of Utah from its site. I want to check Discord and what did I find?

Uh, they still haven't given us an indication of timing. Uh, no, unfortunately not. If we're doing a new name, why even bother putting the name FJB?

Um, yeah, that's, uh, some of the reason why we're not really moving with, um, some other items on the roadmap. That has a lot to do with it. It's just gonna cost us more.

Um, it'd be kind of pointless. I may be out of line, but any chance to refund taxes on Bird King's wife's swabs when she moved his bag? I didn't hear that.

What was all that about? Uh, new wallet name, not new coin name, correct? Yes, um, because LBank and XT both wanted to charge us four new listing fees, uh, if we did change the coin name.

Um, that includes the acronym or the actual name. We tried. Patriot Coin, Freedom Exchange, Trump Coin, Liberty Exchange.

Nothing is running out of supply. Is the new name Truth Social Coin? No.

Is there a Truth Social Coin coming out? Have we decided on a name yet? No, I will let you know once that all, that's decided and all the, uh, uh, accounts have been made so that, uh, we don't have the same sort of events that happened last time when we rebranded from After Biden to Freedom Jobs Business.

No, it's not. I'm not wondering what the name is, just curious if we picked one. Gold coin.

Voice chat on Friday confirmed? Uh, yeah, we can definitely do a voice chat on Friday. By the way, I'm always open for a voice chat if you guys want one, just a lot of the times recently if there's not really an update and, you know, any questions have been answered, um, in the chat, um, I just don't want to bore you all or take up your time on a Tuesday or Friday night, but I'm almost always around, so.

What a gauge from your voice. You are still absolutely confident we are going to move forward and eventually get a war room launched. Oh, yeah, I don't, um, it's, um, that's been my answer, honest answer, um, for months since, uh, BNB came out and said they are fully supporting the project, um, and I believe this was in February, no?

Um, I have been 100% confident of that. That has not changed as far as us, uh, moving forward and eventually getting a war room launch. Um, now the times have changed, and that's why I just hated timelines for over a year now, um, but that's the best we can do.

Um, are they supporting it or will they actually be involved? Um, they are involved, um, they are not just supporting it, and that's why we are waiting on approval, which, um, like I've mentioned before, I know is very frustrating to, you know, wait for so long on something that honestly doesn't, you know, necessarily need so much time. Um, however, um, the good thing, I think, and again, I, I realize, trust me, I realize for me to say that, it's like, oh, well, that's easy for you to say because, you know, because we don't have all the information, um, and I understand that, so I do take, say that with a grain of salt, or please take that with a grain of salt, um, is that they are involved now, that more than, honestly, they have ever been, um, rather than just supporting it, and I think that says a lot, and that's a big deal.

Supporters or owners or both? Um, I would say supporters and owners. They, you know, have come out and said to you all and made it public, um, that they support the coin, and, uh, they own it all, so, and they have since, um, December of what, 2021?

I don't mind waiting for a good thing as long as it will happen eventually. Um, yeah, I understand that, and, um, you know, I understand, I understand not having an update and just waiting, but that honestly is all we're waiting on right now, so, um, and, again, when a lot of coins have died out, I think just, uh, staying alive in this market is a good sign. Is there a way for the devs to find out how many V1 and V2 wallets remain?

I'm sure there is. I think, uh, I think a few of our holders can even figure that out with their super, uh, high-tech and smart brains. They're high-tech tools and they're smart brains.

I think they've done that before, too. That was good to work. Uh, will the update change ownership of the coin?

No. BNB, um, are remaining. The owners of everything, the coin, the LLC, um, yeah, everything that is not changing.

If that were changing, I would be the first to let you know, even if I get blamed for it. Oh, the baby. Two months old.

I have two puppies and I'm going crazy. I can't imagine having a baby. I know, Russ.

Start a wallet. I'm sure he already has one. Three.

Oh, somebody give me their baby so I could babysit for, like, an hour. I know a few people in Discord. Oh, yeah, we will, uh, this is something to go along with.

Well, I think we kind of reviewed it anyway, but please remember to not share your seed phrase with anybody and to not share your seed phrase with anybody, not an admin, not me, not in Discord, not in Telegram, you know, nobody from TrustWallet or LBank or anything like that. And please be careful where you enter your seed phrase. Please don't enter it into any sketchy links.

Yeah, nobody will, admins will not DM you first, so please be careful. I feel like it's been a few weeks since somebody got scammed, so I feel like it's time to say that. Oh my gosh, two, one, three, and ten, six, four, and three.

Wow, nice. Love it. You guys timed them out.

Be nice, Ed. Uh, yeah, thank you all. As usual, let me know if you have any other questions.

Yeah, feel free to DM me, or if you just need somebody to yell at, you can do that, too. Um, let's see. Why is universal fun?

Why is universal... I love him. That's just gross.

Gross. By the way, I made some really good cod today. It was, like, best fish recipe I've ever had, and I'm really not a huge cod person, but it was in the freezer, and I had to use it.

We do, uh, cherry tomatoes, onions, shallots, garlic, what else? And klamata olives. It was the weirdest recipe I found, and then I added a few things to it just in the oven.

Amazing. If anybody wants to make fish this week. Um, recap of call before you go, and also what you're expecting this week.

Um, recap of call. We're still waiting on the approval. Um, reiterating, B&B are still here.

They are still, they still own the project. They are still supporting the project, um, but again, honestly, what's behind, um, I believe them taking so long to approve is really wanting to make sure that this is for the best interest of the coin, the community, um, current community, and future holders. Uh, so please try not to go after them on social media or in their emails.

Again, reiterating, if you need to yell at anybody, my inbox is always open, or tag me, call me, I think a lot of you have my number, text me, you know, whatever it is, uh, email me, but please, please, please don't go after them. They have way more important things to do, um, also reflects poorly on us, um, and I do say that with all love towards you. I know you all have been more than patient, um, and I do understand, of course, where you all are coming from, so please don't take that the wrong way, um, but for the best interest of the coin and to help everything move a little bit more smoothly, uh, again, everything, I have no doubt, uh, approval will happen, that's 100%.

Um, what else? Expecting this week, um, we are waiting on the devs, the devs will be starting updates as soon as they're available to, we do have the funds to get them started, um, to make any changes we can make, um, this will mainly start with getting, uh, bugs in the app fixed, uh, that aren't allowing some of you to swap, um, between FJB and some other coins, uh, some other things like that. We will hold off on the bigger changes because that's going to be a little bit more costly for us to have to redo again.

Um, what else? Um, when marketing, marketing will be after we are done rebranding, um, I don't think there's any point to market while we are trying to rebrand, especially with how hard of a time we had getting into, um, even conservative events with, uh, just FJB. I think that's a really big one.

Yeah. If you're spending your own money on these smaller fixes, what does the reimbursement process look like? Um, I've not been reimbursed.

Don't take that the wrong way. Um, it's just, it's, uh, it's on a balance sheet, but I have not because, uh, fixes like this, we usually pay the devs straight from the marketing wallets, um, because they take, well, some of them, like an example for the gift cards, the devs wanted a straight cash, uh, I believe Zelle payment, if I remember correctly. Um, but most devs take a crypto, crypto payments, so that's paid easy to pay straight out of the, uh, marketing wall.

And I think, who was it, it was a peer, somebody else asked something earlier, um, I think it was yesterday, but somebody tagged me, um, in it, which I'm not sure, to be honest, what it meant as far as, like, something about me paying for someone, but something, but don't worry about that. That is not holding, uh, anything up. Me personally paying for something or not is not the reason we are waiting for approval.

That has nothing to do with it, um, I would not be holding it up about it, because, um, oh, going back to MP, what I'm waiting for this week, um, I'm bugging the heck out of everyone I can to get approval. Is there a certified public accountant retained to track finances? If no, has the CPA reviewed the finances for FJB?

Um, that's more a, a Boris question, um, I know, I believe the person, uh, yeah, I'm not sure if I can answer that. I will, uh, I will hold off on it, but as far as the, for the second part, as far as the review of the finances, um, that goes with everything legal happening that Boris is taking care of. Uh, is there a certified public accountant retained to track the finances?

Uh, the current finances, everything gets logged and, uh, gets sent to somebody on, uh, the war room team. Um, Friday night party. To get this right, B&B have the presentation, won't give the green light, so we're moving forward without the green light.

Hopefully they'll do war room shows, but that's, um, no. Um, no, that's not the case, Sam. Uh, Sam said to get this right, B&B have the presentation, but won't give the green light, so we're moving forward without the green light.

Um, no, we are waiting for their approval. However, um, there are some smaller changes that we can start getting done. The reason why we haven't gotten those completed before is because it's really just going to take a lot longer, um, but at this point, uh, with us just waiting, I think it's right to just, uh, continue moving on, even if that does mean these changes are going to take longer.

Um, hopefully they will do war room shows, but that's not 100% certain. Um, I've been told that that is 100% certain as far as long, or as soon as, I'm sorry, we have everything, um, completed that they need completed. Oh, Cinco de Mayo, I didn't even realize that was Friday.

Who came up with the rebrand? Um, I think that's a decision, um, or conclusion we came to that we do need to rebrand, uh, mainly after having so many, uh, particularly in person, but also websites like my store, uh, refuse us, uh, with no reason, really. Um, and we have no, I don't know, I have no reason to believe it's anything else other than the FJB acronym, which is understandable, because I know even Trump rallies back in the day, you know, they, they don't want FJB there.

If we can get Jeff Roach as a guest on War Room, what would we get? I don't know. So, it was a group decision between you, Bannon, and our crypto advisor.

Um, it was a group decision, I mean, first we brought it up to the community, I think we discussed it several times as a community, um, and then, yes, with our, uh, advisors, and then when the new advisor came on, we also discussed it with him, along with B&B. And everybody, everybody agreed that that's, uh, um, just a good thing to do, move away from the FJB, um, but again, especially since we're having such a hard time getting approved, really, for anything, honestly. So, a new name hasn't been chosen.

No, we have a few. We have a few names, but we'll let you know as soon as that's, oh. When approval comes, will the name have been decided?

Yes, 100%. No, that is not extra time. Just sell the coin to, does, is Truth Social looking for a coin?

Is, uh, Trump all of a sudden into crypto? Sam, I saw it. Are you, oh, you're not in.

Okay, I gotta type to Sam. Let's see, um, thank you all for his glory.

[Speaker 3]
Old school, like, apples.

[Speaker 1]
Ew, what is curried eggs? Uh, what percentage of tax wallets are B&B going to keep for themselves? None.

Absolutely zero. Thanks, MP. I puked when I read it, but no one was eccentric.

I don't know what those are. I tried giggling them, but I don't, I see curried deviled eggs. Or I see, like, actual eggs in curry?

I don't know. I don't think that's what he was talking about. Or maybe he is.

I don't know. It says potato egg curry. It's very interesting.

People always ask me about curry. When I find out I'm brown, then I have to explain to them.

[Speaker 2]
All right, y'all.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that seems to be it. Um, I will post a recording with a few points. I'm sorry, it's not a huge, uh, date.

But, uh, I hope to have one very soon. We are still moving forward. We are still here when many coins or most alternate coins are not, um, which does say a lot.

Your patience does not go unappreciated. Um, yeah, B&B are still owners of everything here. They are, they still fully support everything here.

Um, please go easy on them. If you need to yell at somebody, please do it to me. We're not trying to be a liability.

We're not trying to, uh, you know, reflect poorly on our community. Um, but I think that's it for, uh, Tuesday night. I will talk to y'all later.

Um, have a great night. you
