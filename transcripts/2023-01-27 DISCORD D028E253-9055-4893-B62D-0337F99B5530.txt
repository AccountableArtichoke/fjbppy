[Speaker 1]
I did have the window up, but I didn't record yet. So I literally hid it as soon as I saw that. All right, well, happy Friday.

App or gift cards for the app are as close as they ever could be. They just need to be pushed through the App Store. Very exciting.

I've been testing it the last two days. I can't believe how easy it is. I think it'll be amazing now that we do, as soon as it's live, then we'll go on to paying for events.

And getting those set in stone, which brings me to the next kind of good, kind of bad news, ultimately good, but I know some people will probably be a little bit upset over it. I've seen some talk over this through the months about our FJB. So we are getting denied again and again and again.

And of course, they don't ever give us a reason, but I think it's a no-brainer to thank the FJB and all the FJB stuff in our merch store. So in order for us to actually start getting our applications approved, we will be removing FJB merch from the store. Of course, the Freedom Jobs business will stay, but we will focus more on making it pro-America, pro-what-we're-for, pro-freedom, freedom, jobs, and business, right?

But kind of steer away from the FJB because a lot, I mean, not a lot, everything so far, we're just getting denied left and right and I get it, and most of these are conservative events too, but I'm sure if, you know how that works, if they have other sponsors and they're trying to make money too. So, and we will still have, I should clarify, we'll still have FJB merch with just the FJB, and we will still do that for events that we do that are outside of sponsors and sponsorships, if that makes sense. So if we have our own independent stand just in the middle of nowhere, I know here we had, during elections and probably a year before elections, we had, I don't know if this happens where everybody lives, but here anyway, there's just stands you literally on the side of the road that people stop by and buy shirts.

So we'll still definitely do that, those places, but in order for us to actually start getting accepted and our applications approved, that's what we'll be doing. And we can still have a platform without, yes, absolutely. Yeah, I think, I mean, and it's, you know, it's the places we're applying to are all, I mean, if not, you know, maybe the majority, if not all, very pro-America and very FJB, but again, I get how that works.

They have this sponsor and that sponsor, and they also don't wanna be dropped and they don't want bad publicity. And guess what? Nowadays, if you're wearing a shirt with an American flag or a USA flag, or if you have, you know, your flag hung outside your house, people know you're saying FJB, sadly, right?

So yeah, and yes, absolutely. I definitely do think a lot more people will get in without it. So I think it'll be good for us, but starting there.

Hi, Lauren, I hate Ellen, oh God, but I do like that girl. Okay, got that out of the way. Let's see if I've gotten any questions.

Hi, Sarah, my only question. Oh, that's so nice. My only question I want you to answer today, are you doing okay, I assume?

Going okay, doing okay, yes. Absolutely, yes, I am very, very excited. I think this was a very solid week.

And I think we're finally getting to what we've been waiting for. As far as Bannon and Boris, I am really pressing on them for us to get something scheduled monthly. Otherwise, we gotta get, you know, to some sort of conclusion.

I will definitely keep you updated on that. My call with the attorney that was supposed to happen within one to two days from last Tuesday, last week's Tuesday call, actually is getting pushed to this coming week. So I'll let you know what comes of that, yeah.

So are we forking to lose the FJB? No, not at all. We're still FJB, we're still Freedom Jobs Business.

Just a lot of our merch, which is what we need to turn in on every application for these events. You need to turn in samples of your merchandise. You need to include your website.

And again, I mean, even my store denied us, you know. So, and I think we've seen that before. Like Trump wasn't allowing any FJB inside his rallies, you know, which is fine.

I think we'll do great with that. And I think there's a lot of other really cool things to put on our merch. Oh, thank you, excellent.

Question was more along lines of your personal well-being. Yes, I've been doing really, really well. Thank you so much.

I honestly have, yeah. Just getting some sun, you know, winter. It's winter time, sun went away here for a few weeks and I'm a true Phoenician.

So born and raised here, I need the sun. That's back. I'm hoping for warmer weather soon, but I'm really excited for what's to happen here because that does have a lot of impact on my personal well-being too.

Oh, it's almost sad kind of, huh? Okay. No, absolutely nothing wrong with freedom jobs business.

Absolutely. Let me see what questions. Have you aggressively tried to get BNB to do a voice?

Yes, absolutely. Trying to get that on a monthly basis and really trying to push towards a permanent solution for us so we're not running into this whole, like we're busy, now the legal talks, now this, and I will keep you updated. Do you not have much access to them, I'm assuming?

I mean, text and phone calls. So I'm not sure to their direct numbers and to their assistants. So I don't know what that means, sorry.

Are they aware that the community is devastated and a small sign of a, hey guys, we're still on board and optimistic would help out tremendously, even something prerecorded? Yes, absolutely. When we agreed to do the last call, that was rescheduled a few times.

We finally agreed that it would be prerecorded mainly due to legalities, just in case some, you know, we can edit out, excuse me, listen back and edit out before sharing it with the community. The complete silence is driving everyone insane after investing consider amount of money. It seems really unnecessary.

I completely agree with you. I absolutely agree with you and I'm just as frustrated, if not more frustrated than you are, trust me. However, we are working on a solution to this because I totally understand what you're saying.

I am not happy about it either. I think that's all the questions I got in my inbox, but let me know if you have any other questions. I can't believe how easy and seamless the gift cards are.

So, so easy, of course. You know, that doesn't mean there's not going to be bugs that happen, but we do have our support email on there. And yeah, I'm really excited for you all to see that.

Thank you, appreciate that. Sorry, I missed the last part. What aren't you happy with?

Somebody said the community isn't happy in my inbox. There was a message in my inbox, isn't happy with BNB, not, let me see exactly what it said. The complete silence of BNB is driving everyone insane after investing considerable amount of money.

It seems really unnecessary. So I said that I'm not happy about that either. I totally understand where you're coming from.

I'm just as, probably more frustrated. What else, what else? Our social media still looks amazing.

Our website is very, very close. Time to build, pulling up on two gift cards. Thank you all for his glory.

Are the beads happy enough with the slow going of things and did they ever express some motivation for the project last year? You regularly reported that they were 100% behind the project and pumped. Sorry, it's cool, and really pumped.

I know Boris has been very unhappy with the missing funds and I know he's been focused on the legal aspect of that. I honestly, that's what pretty much all the talk has been regarding. And I will have an update for you as soon as I possibly can.

Our recording that was scheduled for, last it was scheduled was for earlier this month, I believe. Maybe it was like the end of last month. On a Tuesday, was supposed to be a recorded message for the community of him just updating you all, making sure that you are all aware that he's aware of what's going on and that he got on this as soon as he was made aware of the missing funds.

And like I said, that was not able to get rescheduled, not out of me not wanting to get to, not out of me not trying. And I will let you know as soon as I have an update. I've helped a couple.

Okay, so I've helped a couple of boomers set up FJB app. They all want to do the option, I'll do it later, regarding, I think if you all have done like your FJB app. Excuse me, the, yeah, the FJB app.

On the FJB app, your vest, where you have to go through all those steps, like back it up with a friend or add a browser, any of that, and then at the bottom, it says I'll do it later, I'm guilty of that. Will their funds be inaccessible if they brush off completing that process? What measure will be taken to make that a more seamless process?

Okay. So, the talks I've had with Vest regarding this when others have asked is that this is really a security issue. Why the I'll do it later, you know, those steps is for their own security.

That's why they need to be set up. Because say they lose their keys or say they never wrote down their keys, that's gonna be a problem. And if they didn't add a friend or add a browser and say they got a new phone, like a lot of people did that after Christmas.

And I had several DMs of people wondering where the heck their keys went because they didn't realize that with a new device, you know, that's a new browser. So, will their funds be inaccessible? Well, yeah, say they got a new phone, a new device, and didn't have any of those steps, they didn't, what is it?

Sorry, I can't think of the verbiage that Vest uses. You know, and they did the I'll do it later instead of adding a friend or recovery, another browser, some kind of recovery, right? Then that's gonna be the problem.

They're not gonna, they're gonna be locked out of their own account and that's for security purposes. You know, you can go ahead and recover, but again, you're gonna need some sort of information, right? If you have any more detailed questions or suggestions, please let me know and I can definitely talk to Vest about it.

And we can discuss further options. Are the missing funds in the US? Yeah, I'm not sure.

Are they're still pumped? I know Boris is, I don't know if pumped's the word when you're like really pissed off. Yeah, fired up, definitely.

But I'll let them get on hopefully to speak to you about that. Can you tell BNB not to push it until the last minute so we can keep buying at these low prices? They're still buying?

Man, I've spent all my money. I'm eating ramen over here. Let's see if, sorry, when DMs come in, I'm just wondering if they have questions.

Gonna watch my friend's play softball for her work thing, you know, they play softball and some stuff like that. That should be exciting and cool as heck. That's why I'm having a coffee so late, a caffeinated one.

Me too, I'm ready for price action. What update was Willow talking about? Hmm, I don't know.

What update was he talking about? In here or Telegram? Hmm, I honestly haven't paid attention to much of what's been going on this afternoon in Telegram because I've been testing the gift cards.

Let me see. He's just being silly or was he actually talking about a real update? I feel like I would know of an update, but Code Merge, would what?

Let's see. Okay, I see an update coming here. Code Reemerge, check with Sarah for official release schedule though.

Oh, that's the gift cards. Yeah. I have to search Code Update or Code Merge.

Super exciting. Information is classified. I feel like some of you all are already drinking and it's only 5.55 here. If FJB coin isn't appropriate anywhere on Freedom Jobs Business, this is a new path, one will be an update. Let's see, get a big mouse camera, Grace or Mo. Gosh, I wish I had a microwave in here.

Do gift cards automatically create an account through the app? So, you'll all see how it works, but the way it'll work is there will be a QR code that you can scan or you can also go to a website and enter the code that's on the paper, on the gift card envelope, paper in the envelope that you receive. So, you either A, scan the QR code or go to the website, link attached there and copy and paste a code in there.

And that's going to take you to the app. If you don't already have the app, then it's gonna ask you to either open browser or download the app. So, you'll do that.

And then after that, that's like literally it. Once you make that, you have a gift card. It's so easy.

Any news what they're deciding on LP and borrowing from it? I believe that will be taken care of if the call with the attorney happens next week. Like it's supposed to, then that will be directly afterwards.

And I mean, like the same day. If that does get rescheduled, which I'm sorry if it does, completely out of my hands, it will be again, whenever that call gets rescheduled with the attorney. Pretty important to take care of that first.

Unless Slinky's just taking the LP, I guess. Will there be instructions in the envelope with the gift card? Yes.

With an email address and a link in case you have issues. But it really is very, very, very easy. I feel like the IRS has tracking capabilities everywhere, but you know, I love you guys too.

They take in Diesel's place. I feel like that's what usually Diesel's place. Are you Diesel?

Maybe you're Diesel. Slinky is Diesel after all. Will there be instructions on the website for the gift cards?

Yes. You'll have a specific gift card page and that's on the physical gift card in case they want that. Go off YouTube after 800,000 views.

Has 20 million views on Twitter though. Did you guys see all the memes people made about that video? Somebody made one that James O'Keefe posted that said, chicks when you catch them in a lie.

And then they had the guy's reaction. The Pfizer employees reaction right under. The ones like when you start smoking again after a long break.

So a quick recap. FJB becoming formally Freedom Jobs Business. Yes, so we gotta get into events.

Boris still angry and following legal recourse for missing funds. Boris might make a recording for the group. Gift cards almost ready.

Merch being changed. No update. Referencing LP.

Yes, the LP, no update as of now, but as soon as we have the call with the attorney, that'll be literally the same day. That decision should be made. No update.

Referring app readiness. No news. Okay, so Bannon, no update on Transac.

Transac said today that, because I had messaged them a few days ago because a few people were having issues using their Zelle. And they got back to me today at 7.08 a.m. So we are back. They are back, Transac, testing our flows for Zelle and Venmo and working on the feedback we received from the initial release.

That said, our Cash App deployment is working successfully and users can use that alongside cards, Apple and Google Pay in the US. They will keep us updated on the developments with the above mentioned APMs. So, so that should be Cash App is still good. Again, alongside cards, Apple, Google Play, like he said.

However, yeah, the Zelle and Venmo is still being tested, which I figured what was happening earlier in the week, but we just wanted to confirm. They did say they will update us once everything is live. And yes, I did, somebody else updated me too regarding the six month, that being extended.

And I mean, we know how that works. I'm sure there's a ton of hoops for them to jump through too to be able to off-ramp here. So it looks like their deadline changed a bit, which is totally cool.

Holders buying gift cards helps the cash flow of the project, correct? Yes, although right now our wallets are pretty much paused regarding what's coming out of our marketing wallets, waiting on that LP decision. But yes, absolutely.

This is why gift cards was a huge deal because we figured if we do get a booth somewhere selling merch and ultimately it's for the FJB coins, people are impatient, especially if they're at an event, they don't wanna sit there and do KYC there or do all that stuff in public or their debit card, call their bank. So we figured this would be a super, super easy way to do it. That way we have these cards already preloaded and they step up, they slide their card or give cash and walk away with a gift card.

And they can go ahead and install that and turn it into their phone or computer at their convenience. That is our number one goal, really is getting BNB to commit to more of a monthly, something hopefully the community, the 27th. I do apologize for that.

I promise it's not out of me not having an answer for you as soon as I possibly can, just waiting on them. Oh, when I say Boris, it's Boris and Bannon. Boris is just a lot more involved.

Do the gift cards work through the app or is it a separate process? No, they work through the app. It's amazing, it adds it right to your app.

There isn't even a demand for gift cards. Weren't those promised at Thanksgiving, then Christmas, then New Year's? Yep, and development takes longer.

Devs started it before Christmas and it's something they haven't done before. They have never had gift cards on an app like this. So yes, we're doing something for the first time and it has taken longer than expected.

If you can do it better, you are more than welcome to. Will holders be able to buy gift cards for friends and family to distribute however they want? Yes, absolutely, because the gift card literally comes in a sealed envelope with a little window that has the wallet's public address.

So if you wanted to buy $10, $25 gift cards, you do that and then you pass them out to whoever you want to pass them out to. Super, super cool. Again, it's not something you need to set up.

It's not something, you know, it's just in the envelope. All they need to do is scan it or enter the link and then go through Vess. I'm trying it with new email addresses and you know, Vess, you could do the, I'll do this later.

So all it is is entering your email address, which sends a code to your email address. You put that code into your browser and that's it. That simple.

Of course, you do want to add your recovery steps. You don't wanna do the, I don't, I wanna do this later because you don't want to lose access of your funds. Do we buy the gift cards through the app or the website?

So this is what we're trying to figure out right now. It's, the devs are getting the update pushed through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. But I will update you on that.

It will for sure be available on the website. Not sure about the app yet. That's awesome.

Also, what we'll do is add, so on the merch store, we'll add option where you can get it, say like a shirt plus a gift card and it'll be, say the shirt is, I don't know, 25 bucks, gift card's 25, it'll be 50 bucks. And you'll get those in separate packages, but you'll get them mailed to you. Do we pay for the gift cards in dollars or FJB?

Dollars. And this is all beginning. Of course, there's always room for change.

So we can always make this better depending on what kind of activity we need. Make it work for us. But I'm very, very, very happy about it.

I can't believe it. Not pay for gift cards with Monopoly money. I'm very sorry.

Do I think the missing funds will ever be recovered? I am not sure. I'm sure as heck not an attorney.

So that's, yeah, I'm not sure. However, as I said from the very beginning, I myself will go after the responsible parties if I need to. And that has not changed and it will not change.

I can promise you that. But as far as recovering the funds, yeah, I'm not sure. I think a lot depends on the call with the attorneys.

But trust me, it's not a lack of volunteers. It's not a lack of writers, editors, people volunteering, or my time. I'm just waiting in limbo right now.

But as of less than two hours ago, I'm told that this will be taken care of next week. And we should kind of have a solution. So very excited for that.

Oh, I just realized I misspelled Friday. Okay, so expecting an update about the direction next week. Sorry.

Okay, so expecting an update next week about the direction of the project. Correct, we're waiting on some pretty critical points regarding legalities, regarding scheduling a monthly sort of appearance commitment with B&B. So I'll update you as soon as I get an update.

And then directly after that is when we'll have an answer regarding the LP, whether we'll borrow against the LP or not, and yeah, to help us a bit with funding. Sorry, Ronnie. No, I just started reading it, and then I know a lot of people that listen to the recordings have asked me to read the questions out loud.

So I felt like I needed to reread it a little bit more clearly. I know I talk too fast sometimes, and I know I'm really awful at mumbling. So I'm sorry, I apologize.

All righty, is that all? Any more questions before I get off here? I just ate dinner, but I feel like I wanna stop it in and out.

Grab a few burgers, burger patties, I should say. That's all, folks. Yes, I'm gonna wait for plus P to see in case he's typing a question.

And then I'll upload these in case anybody needs to listen to them. Again, thank you for your patience. We will get through this.

I know it's not been an ideal road, but we absolutely will with the community that we have. Okay, last question. If they take a loan, would you expect the app to be fast-tracked to launch ready state?

Assume if this happened, we would... Image, that's all stations. Yes, absolutely.

If we did take a loan out, I would 100% expect the app to be fast-tracked, absolutely. I'd expect that. I'd expect some pretty big events.

Oh, actually, a tiny little update. I kind of got really, it was like totally not unplanned, but somebody we're pretty, pretty close to, which I had no idea, is pretty big at TPUSA. So I'm very excited about that.

I just learned it this morning. So I don't wanna jinx it, but yeah, I don't know how I didn't know this. So I'm really excited about that.

But I will keep you updated. Maybe that's a little bit of why I'm in extra chipper mood today, too. But yeah, so I'll definitely let you know.

No, not an influencer, like somebody who's actually just higher up at TPUSA. I'm sure they can get us in somehow. Yes, please.

I need exit liquidity. What? What are you talking about?

You are very welcome to Relish. You all have a wonderful night. Buy more of JB tonight, so we moon, Dogbone says.

Dogbone, thank you for all your work on the website. It looks amazing. The FAQ looks amazing.

As soon as we have a, some little details filled in from upper management. But thank you for all you do. I know that's a ton of work, and we'd be lost without you.

When Diesel, hey, I miss Diesel. But we put him in Gulag, and then he started claiming, asking me how much I pay myself and how many coins or how much of the merch money I make. Guys, I make zero.

I literally get paid zero anything here. Not a percentage, not a coin, not a dollar. So, yeah.

But Diesel's welcome back when he can, I understand he's frustrated, we all are, but when he can stop being a little, little you know what. What's up with all the Jasmine things? You are very welcome.

Alrighty, you all have a wonderful night. I'm sure I'll be here. I just gotta upload these and then make the trek all the way to the west side of the valley.

But yeah, I'll talk to you later tonight. Thank you for sticking around. I can't wait for it to be all worth it.

Have a great night.
