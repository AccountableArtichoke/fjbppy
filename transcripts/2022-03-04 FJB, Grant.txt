(0:00 - 0:10)
Guess of of where this project has gone. It was on 1 path in the beginning, and then we kind of took a left turn and then change again and change again and change again. And we've really.

(0:10 - 0:46)
Like, the as a community and the app. Has really geared itself up. And set itself up for the future and that's like the most exciting thing because where what we started this on. 

I started this back in the day on October 22nd and then. Uh, it was a lot of movement and changes and stuff and now fast forward to March 4th. Kind of crazy that we're here to be honest. 

It. It was like, just yesterday it was back in October, uh, talking about what we were doing and where we wanted to go and that they want energy and and everything like that. And now it's March 4th and.

(0:47 - 0:56)
Just to see this thing through. And to see it, it come, uh, almost to fruition. I think once we get that app, then it's like, wow, this is.

(0:56 - 0:59)
We really, we really did. We really made something amazing. Um.

(1:00 - 1:19)
JB really did something amazing and I couldn't be happier to be a part of this community to be, uh, to be a holder here and to and to. Have a blast, I think mostly this is it's been a lot of fun. I know that I've been maybe a little bit more quiet as of recent, um, there's some personal things and some things that are going on, which.

(1:20 - 1:53)
I don't, it shouldn't affect this, but maybe I've just been a little quiet and I apologize. So, um, however, I'm going to be here. Always, like, I, I will always be in this discord. 

I'll always be in the telegram. I will always be. A huge supporter and a huge fan, a huge fanatic of because I really love what it's all about and that's about freedom jobs and business. 

That's about, uh. Unity that's about having fun. That's about having the right to do.

(1:53 - 2:14)
And say what you feel, and that's what this is. That's what is and. I can just say, um, I am so tremendously excited for this app. 

I really don't have much else to come up here and say, like, hey, we have this news or that news. Um, because the way is it's not me. You know, it's it's I'm I'm a holder of this coin.

(2:15 - 2:29)
I'm a, I'm a excited for the future of and I'm really excited to see. What's going on and to see the fruition of this? I know I, I maybe, maybe actually what? So it's the 4th right now. Uh, Donald pump.

(2:30 - 2:54)
I told you guys that I would do a whole pie of pizza. I still got to do a whole pie of pizza. So, it's the February 4th, it's March 4th right now, which is good now, because it's starting lent. 

So, on Fridays, I don't eat meat. I should do a pie pizza today. I didn't do 1. I was like, you know what? I can't. 

I'm not going to do a whole pie pizza, but maybe next Wednesday. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll let, you know, when I'll eat a whole pie pizza, 8 slices of a large pizza as fast as I can, because you guys deserve something. You guys deserve a little bit of fun.

(2:54 - 4:30)
And I think that you guys get a kick out of that. You guys, that cracks up a little bit, but just know, just know that the team is very established and the team is very credible and they're working to make sure that every single 1 of your questions that has been asked in the discord, all of your concerns about security, all your concerns about, hey, is this going to be easy to buy? Where's my wallet? What's it going to look like? Is it a native wallet? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. What you're trying to find out, what you're trying to see, they will all be answered beforehand. 

And I can assure you, because just think of the people that are involved, Bannon, Boris, Finman. These people are very calculated. They, they wouldn't do something without getting all of their eggs in a row before they hatch. 

They wouldn't do that. These people have worked with the president of the United States, with Donald Trump. They know when 1 person's on step 1, they're already on step 6. So this team is really, really amazing. 

Really amazing. It hits me randomly sometimes. Like I said, I was on a walk today. 

It hit me. I was like, holy hell, this team is awesome because there's so many powerhouses and heavyweights here and titans. And that's the best part about it. 

That's really the best part about it. So, March 4th, March 16th, the app will be here. It's going to be on time. 

It's going to be awesome. It's going to be amazing. It's going to be the thing that we've been talking about and leading up to for so long, because we had so many different goals and so many different.

(4:30 - 4:47)
Uh, I guess checkpoints that we wanted to hit and now it's like, the app is going to be there and then and then once you hit that, then it really, then you have to hit the ground running with marketing and things like that. And just know that there's a team there. Like I said, Boris Bannon, uh, and Eric and.

(4:48 - 5:14)
These guys have done a tremendous job, uh, marketing and pushing and, uh. Basically strategy strategy in general strategy is probably the best way to describe it and these people are. In that field, absolute experts, so I'm so excited. 

I couldn't wait. I can't wait for for this to happen. I to rock. 

I love that video. That video cracks me up, but, uh, you guys are awesome. And and just know that that.

(5:15 - 5:50)
I'm just having so much fun here. I hope you guys are still having fun. I think that's what separates us as as a coin is I've been in other discords. 

I've been another telegrams. I've been another follow the other instagrams and so on and so forth of other communities and stuff. And there's, there's nothing like this. 

There's no, there's no other. Group or coin or, uh, community that does what we do. I saw a, like the tip statistics and fuego is tipping like thousands upon thousands of dollars. 

And it's, it's like amazing to see. It's a, it's amazing to see people here. That exactly the top tippers.

(5:50 - 6:09)
It goes tipped almost as much as me. It's crazy. I was like, I need to set my game up. 

You guys are absolutely awesome. You guys are insane. And it just, it just goes to show, like, people here are really, really, really amazing. 

They're really amazing. And the hype train is real. The hype train is definitely real and can say is.

(6:10 - 6:50)
I'm so happy to be here. I hope that you guys are all happy to be here and. Just just keep having fun. 

Keep being excited. Keep that day 1 energy going because that's all we can do. You know, that's all you can have is energy. 

And I heard something a long time ago, but it's, it's really true. Is that your attitude determines your altitude. How you think of things and how you perceive the world is just how high you can go. 

So, if we're thinking, hey, this is our attitude. It's really, really great. Our attitude is always fired up. 

Your attitude is day 1 energy. Even when nobody's telling us, we're shilling. We're telling somebody new. 

We're out to dinner or at a bar. I see somebody we're talking about. We're bringing it up.

(6:52 - 7:18)
What I do, like, on a day to day basis, I still love this thing. It was something that I started such a long time ago and it's been passed off and everything like that. But this is still like a passion project. 

It's just to see it, see it through it from the sidelines is awesome. So, your attitude determines your altitude and that's really what it's all about. Like, my attitude about coin and about about the app and about everything that we're doing and everything that we've done is so tremendously high.

(7:18 - 7:52)
And I think that is a great way to put it where it's like, you can go as far as you want to. And that's what I really do think separates us from everybody else because we have a lot of true patriots here. We have some absolute amazing people in this community and yeah, people might think, oh, it's taking forever. 

We have so many more days until the app, but look, just take a step back. I won't even I won't even say how many things we've done because we've done so many amazing things. So many amazing things.

(7:53 - 8:04)
Uh, the list of accomplishments can go on and it's because of you guys. It's because you guys are in here on a Friday night. What is it? 160 maybe days later since we started this project and you guys are still here listening.

(8:04 - 8:16)
I can't I can't wait until we're like, 1 year removed next October. We'll throw a whole we'll throw a 1 year party next October. We're going to throw a 1 year reunion of, uh.

(8:17 - 8:27)
And we're going to have we're going to we're going to have a blast. We're going to go on a cruise or something. We got to do something big, but, uh, I just, I just love all you guys and I'm just so happy to be here to still be.

(8:29 - 9:04)
So, be a part of this because it really is a lot bigger than just 1 individual and I hope you guys all have a great weekend. I will connect again. I will do another voice call probably next week. 

Like I said, I owe you guys a pizza. Um, so I'm still gonna be having fun here. I hope you guys all have a great Friday night. 

Hope you guys have something great to drink. Donnie actually sent me a Guinness. All the way from Ireland, so I got to drink it sooner or later, you know, so everybody have a great night. 

Be safe. Happy Friday. And God bless you all. 

This is I'm really, I'm really, really am so excited. Everybody have a great weekend.
