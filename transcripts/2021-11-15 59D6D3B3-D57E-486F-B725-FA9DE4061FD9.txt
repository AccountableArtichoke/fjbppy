Can a lot of deals and trying to figure out some things Some things that are gonna make this coin go to the complete next level and then find the next level after that So this thing is really tremendous. This was today was day 24 Feel like it's I was saying this before to day 24. I feel like it's been freaking 224 years. 

I feel like it's been this project's been a long time and Best part about this is I'm gonna leave this short and sweet and I'm gonna bring somebody up here somebody that I've Come to know in the past week or so great guy a tremendous experience in this field and he's he's going to be one of the people that that take this project to the next level through his connections through his experience and Yeah through everything he's done. So without further doubt, we're bringing up. I just invited him to speak I was gonna wait until he popped up. 

I think he's got to click it Yes, what's going on Ryan? Hey, you guys hear me Now we hear you loud and clear man Awesome. Well, let me just say this. It's it's great to be here. 

This is a phenomenal project Something I didn't even anticipate would pop up, you know I think many people got involved in this crypto stuff a lot earlier this year with the AMC and GME and now it's kind of evolved into something much bigger than that And I mean really proud of you guys. I mean this has taken a turn for the best I would say I mean you guys how many weeks old and you have this many organic people holding this coin I mean just a few weeks and already over 5,000 I mean that that is impressive in itself and I and I think that this is Indicative of a much much bigger movement here Because everybody says right, you know, they say Biden the most popular president 81 Million votes 81 million votes and people are chanting Let's go Brandon and fuck Joe Biden all across the country every Saturday at football games This is what you're seeing, right? And so to see a coin now Not only just you know people making money off of this but actually seeing money go to Good go to charities for veterans You know, there's homeless vets all across the country there's veterans suffering from PTSD and there's not enough help out there and so To see that some of the portions of this is going to such an amazing calls tunnels to towers wounded warrior project Quite a few more from what I understand coming up. So really amazing really amazing stuff guys Hey, man, and thanks for coming up here. 

And for those of you guys that that don't know Ryan I know that I'm seeing the chat right now blow up. Don't let Ryan humble himself. He is tremendous He's done extensive work in this. 

He has he knows the Trump's personally. He's the founder of students for Trump This guy's is a powerhouse in this field and so don't let him come up here and Talk himself down because many people in this community know and and I know This is a fucking exciting moment to have him a part of the scene because you have him a part of your team You're gathered. It's like, you know, like in Space Jam it's like getting the Monstars like we were assembling the Monstars and Ryan is playing point guard and we have we have a killer team and we're only getting better and stronger and and This is a fantastic start. 

And if this is this is the start then I am so excited for what's next And yeah, thanks for being here Ryan and thanks for hopping on voice. He's a busy guy He does if we think that that we're busy doing all this and I think that I'm busy doing this For him to hop on a call tonight at 8 is pretty tremendous because this guy probably travels more than he sleeps So thanks for coming on man Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean in truth on that. 

Yeah. Thankfully I've been grounded for for about two or three weeks now not having to travel And so it's giving me more focus here, but you know, I don't usually endorse Crypto, I don't endorse a lot of these different things I haven't turned my page into a giant ad like some of these other folks have Because when I push something I believe in it, right and I think that that's how anybody should be with a following with a voice You guys here are pushing this coin because you believe in it whether that be because you want to make some some quick income or Because you believe in the fact of the mission in the movement and really what it means because it's much bigger than that Because there are like I said earlier There is a big need out there For flop for funding for numerous vet organizations Independence fund is a great one that I recommended to these guys as well who provide these motorized chairs For these veterans. They look like mini tanks. 

They're absolutely incredible and for any wounded warrior wounded hero out there you know, they love these things and so Funding and donations that is so important. But one of the things also is that This coin and and this is interesting to say if you really think about it is this has got at least a four-year haul Because there's at least you guys have to understand And and and when I say this, I really do mean it and I hate that I say it Obama Was better than than this guy and and I'm and I'm really serious about that because with him the first year of Obama's presidency We didn't have anywhere near what we have now In this country with the the staggering unemployment rates the border crisis the vice president who only shows up when it's time for a vote It's astronomical to see the failure And that in itself Pushes the slogan pushes the coin pushes the hype and that's what you guys got to keep targeting is that you know this may be a little bit political, but the coin is political in itself because the guy's an idiot and I You know, there's no point. I don't know yeah, I don't know how you fumble the ball so much but this guy fumbles the ball like he's you know, it's like it's an everyday thing and Every time there's a story every time there's there's a new gaffe You guys got a jump on that stuff because it doesn't just help this it pushes the message and everything else you guys are doing But but nonetheless, I mean, this is tremendous growth. 

The community here is absolutely amazing To say the least to see you guys helping each other Being informative creating these graphics. I mean, this is the type of stuff that I never expected Coming to a crypto community because I don't really you know, go to these communities and stuff. I'll look at what's on Twitter It's like oh shib is trending I'll buy some shib or whatnot, you know stuff like that but to see that there's a whole community a base of people who want to go out there and Be together and really and make this movement something bigger than than what it is really is is incredible And one more. 

Oh, go ahead. I know you keep your you're good man. Keep going And then one other thing here, you know, one of the things that I told grant here is that This is gonna blow up You know once influencers start touching this stuff and you know, of course, they're all gonna do their own vetting They're all gonna do their own checks because nobody wants, you know to think they're being scammed or something like that But you know, I looked into this personally myself. 

I had my team look into it. They've provided Everything that you can imagine to to show that this isn't some rug pull. I'm learning all these new terms. 

So, please excuse me This is something great and they really do mean what they're doing. They mean what they say And I think you guys are in really good hands and from what I understand There's some more influencers who are interested in this and are interested in promoting it So and I'm gonna be pushing myself as well I've got a couple calls coming up here in the next week or two with some pretty prominent folks within you know They have a pretty good gravitas Around them in terms of their political Influence, so we're gonna be working on that as well. And anything I can do for you guys You know, my DMS are always open. 

Please. Let me know. I don't want this to just be some sort of Endorsement and you never see me again I'm definitely committed to this you guys have my a hundred percent full and complete endorsement and Somebody asked me earlier actually because they know me and they were like, why don't you do your Trump impersonation? And so I guess I'll do it. 

We're gonna build a big wall And the FJB token is gonna pay for that wall. Believe me. Believe me It honestly my favorite token man, that was actually fantastic and like when you and I first spoke to you Cuz I hear you hear you on like videos and I've been following you for a while I think yeah, he kind of does sound like Trump that I him and I had a zoom call a week I was like this guy sounds like Trump man And I I just said you just you Google yourself and you see pictures of you and Trump you see pictures of you and Eric It's awesome. 

And this is the type of guy that we got on our team, man And he's he's a powerhouse in this space and he's a guy that's gonna be around for a long time Like I said the founder of students for Trump again, don't let Ryan talk himself down Yeah founder students for Trump. He's got over 400,000 files on Instagram students for Trump almost has a million He's extremely well connected definitely has the phone numbers of some extremely important people He's already been working tirelessly on this project Giving me giving us ideas for graphics giving us ideas for how to keep moving this thing forward and and that's the pretty amazing thing right Ryan we have nine people listening tonight and it doesn't seem like that many but for the crypto world to Get on these discord calls and and to have active users It's it's so I've been in communities with 12,000 members, but only 200 people are active We have 3,700 people and over a thousand of those people are active every single day a thousand people send a message a day a thousand different people which is like unlike any other discord and and telegram to you have your telegram group with a whole lot of people But we we have a tremendous following already. We have over 5,000 holders I think we're at 5,300 was last time I checked and this is only three weeks in three and a half weeks in don't need A $30,000 a charity you've provided some tremendous insight It's as some new charities on who to donate to and this is just the start man We're we're going up. 

We do we do a lot of fun things in here And in this community and we also do a lot of good a lot of donations a lot of people helping out everybody And if you ever seen the movie semi pro the ELE everybody love everyone That's what we got in here and we got we got a we got a great. We got a great crowd. It's a lot of fun Yeah, and and I've noticed that and that's great And and you know, I am very new to this stuff Like I said, and so jumping on board with this has been you know Sort of a learning curve for me And so I'm thankful for some of the people that have helped me actually set up Trust wallet and all this stuff because it's another level of crypto, but you guys have to understand You know once this stuff gets on these other markets It's gonna be much easier to buy and that's that's when you're gonna have an influx I think one of the biggest things that holds people back your average Joe is having to download these wallets and stuff like that But I mean that process gets much easier When it gets added to these other exchanges and you guys have to to look forward to that as well But I like I said, this is kind of a cultural market piece where you know you have Just this viral term that comes out of nowhere to really just peacefully Detest and protest the sitting resident, right? That's what I call him the resident of the white house, you know and and and really it's probably one of the most effective forms Of protesting that I've ever seen in my life because now you have a cryptocurrency You have a cryptocurrency now that also is Promoting that message I mean 2021 couldn't get more wild and you guys are sitting in the next dot-com boom right now I would you know, and I'm not a financial advisor I must say that as well because I don't want the SEC coming at me those guys probably They're probably got everybody on their list. 

But you know, it's I'm not an accountant. I'm not a CPA I don't take my advice yada yada yada. Let me just do the Dave Portnoy But I will say that this is something that you know, I purchased some I'm personally gonna be holding For a while because we're not done with this hellhole of a roller coaster yet And I think people need to look at that as we got another three years of this nightmare you know and It's not gonna change, you know, hopefully nothing happens to Joe, but then it's like let's go Kamala is the next thing, right? I mean, it's it's like it's failure after failure and those failures Propel this this movement this propel this This thing of change right and so keep doing what you guys are doing You know keep pushing this stuff do as much as you can Because you know, I think a lot of folks are like, oh man I wish I had a gun on the ship train or wish I had gotten on all these other things back in the day And believe me I've been in that same spot where it's like, oh, I wish I'd put more money in that now But I mean it's like the story with the guy who had the ship, right? He put $8,000 worth in ship last year. 

Now. It's worth like what three point four three point seven billion dollars How the hell do you even cash that out right and and it's just incredible how it's changing lives Is really what it comes down to at the end of the day and this is isn't changing Individuals lives in this channel or have bought into it is changing the lives of people who bought for and and possibly Even died for our country sign that blank check up into including their life perhaps and so It's a very honorable thing for you guys to be doing this be giving money to these charities I can tell you as this thing picks up more steam the media is going to give it notice I promise you guys that I saw they gave this other coin some notice. I don't really know who this guy is I heard he's a hedge fund guy down in West Palm Beach. 

We don't like the hedge fund guys. So, you know how that goes But this is this is really great work here grant really great work Amazing community you guys just keep doing what you're doing and and my Prediction my my honest prediction as a commentator is it's gonna go to the moon. So There's that Hey, man, thank you so much for having for hopping on. 

You're a busy guy I won't hold you too long, but I'm looking at the chat right now and the chats blowing up to have you on here is tremendous and there's a lot of people that follow you very closely and We have some big fans in here and when when they found out that we were bringing you on and then when they actually heard You speak man there there their whole day is made and they feel very confident that this is the right horse to back Because this is the right horse to back and like you said, it's not financial advice or anything like that but this is a tremendous coins than a lot of good and a strong community and people like you that's all the building blocks and all the makings of This thing going to the moon like you said Well, let me tell you something Let me tell you something This coin is perhaps going to be one of the best coins in the history of this country Let me tell I have my own coin and there's nothing quite frankly as good as that one. It's DWAC But let me tell you something this coin this coins gonna be some competition. It's gonna be some big league Competition but let me tell you something. 

We're gonna build that wall We're gonna use the FJB coin to fund it and we're gonna put Joe on the other side of the wall. Thank you and God bless Thank you so much Ryan. You're the man Anytime.
