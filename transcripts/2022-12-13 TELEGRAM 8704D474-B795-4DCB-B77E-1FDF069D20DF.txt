[Speaker 1]
Hello, happy Tuesday. Can you all hear me?

[Speaker 7]
He says it wasn't me this time.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. I'm not sure what happened, but telegram looks like anybody in it. I don't know if those were settings I could change.

I actually haven't looked into that. Well, thank you for joining me. Happy Tuesday.

I'm finally feeling better. I'm 100% over whatever it is I got. So, first thing first, I'm really sorry Boris had to reschedule.

I told you last week he had to reschedule and that's why I hadn't said anything, but everybody was kind of getting on me. I felt like people felt like I didn't want to get Boris on and I didn't know how important it was for everybody that he'd get on. So I had to tell you that we had scheduled him and then he actually had to cancel pretty last minute.

So that's very unfortunate. We are waiting for him to reschedule an exact time. I'm really sorry.

I've told him how much you all want to hear from him and how important it is for us to hear from him and Bannon. So I'll keep you updated for sure. Still getting messages of people thinking they're walking away.

I can assure you that's not the case. I just feel that things on the back end are taking longer than expected and I just feel like he wants to settle some of that before speaking to the community, but that is my complete assumption. So that's that.

Again, I am super, super sorry. I wish it were completely up to me. It's just, you know, he has slots for everything in his day and certain time slot is his FJB time slot.

And right now that's being used up for more important calls. Not that you're not all important, but I feel like these calls are all necessary to make sure everything keeps flowing and help move us in the right direction and make everything right for us. I do think he will appreciate it in the long run.

So let's get, I got a few questions. How much of Velo's list has been tackled since October 1st? Sorry, I have answered this before.

So since all the changes we had, we actually switched gears in that list that Velo had shared with us. We are not, our number one goal now is to get that smart wallet working and to get the FJB gift cards and then start working on bugs. We did onboard a brand new dev yesterday to help us.

He has already started. He's been working all day. It's been super, super busy.

I'm sorry, I've not been in the chats much, but I am reading everything. He's doing a great job and helping out Velo since he is very, very busy. So we're, right now we're hoping to get the smart wallet, the testers that started this weekend.

Some functions weren't working correctly, so he is working on that. I think in the last hour he already found why some transfers weren't working, so he is working on that right now as we speak to get that working for the testers. Let's see.

Hopefully it doesn't kick people off. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, it doesn't.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. The second question I got, and these were the only two questions I got, with Binance in the news and the uncertainty surrounding it, is the team considering leaving VAB and going to another chain? If so, what other chains are the team considering?

I believe Optimism, if you all have heard of that one. It's also, so it's on, it's basically, I don't know. I'll let somebody who knows the technical side explain more of that for you all.

But yes, that is being discussed. I'm not sure we will do that just because we do think this is something that's going to pass, but it is being discussed as recent as today, and we are keeping that option open. It would be, let me go into the chat, so even as recent as today that I can probably say it all better than I can, because, you know, technical stuff is not my area.

So we wouldn't be getting rid of the anything that's existing, and basically it would just be a bridge, which we spoke about before. So yeah, that's CryptoMoon just included a link. So that's, there is talks of that.

We're thinking if we would bridge to a different chain, it would be that. So, but again, this is just being discussed. Nothing even remotely in the works or anything like that.

I'll definitely keep you updated if there is. So we'll see how, especially how Bannon feels depending on, you know, if he keeps going hard on Binance. But yeah, so, and that is we're able to do that.

We've already confirmed with Velo, and actually this was his idea even before all the Binance news. So I think that would be good for us if we do decide to go in that direction, but we'll definitely keep you updated. Let's see.

Other updates. So the app, I already mentioned that we onboarded the new dev who's already been working on getting the smart wallet up and running. We did get two approvals back.

One is for Amazon to sell merch. The other, I think I told you about, and somebody from the community actually sent this one to me back in November, and we never heard back from them. It's Noble US.

I don't know how you say it. I think it's just Noble US. But we got an approval from them today too, and Amazon, they were both today.

So pretty cool. Some bad news. We did get denied, but we are trying again from the MyStore.

We got denied. They told us four to six weeks, but we actually heard back, I want to say yesterday, and my assumptions, they don't give a reason. They just tell you, like, you got denied.

Good luck. Mike Lindell, very nice. But I assume it's because of the FJB possibly.

So we will try again. We're already through that application. We are adding some non-FJB items and more like pro-America, pro-USA, pro-Patriot, and hope that goes through.

Again, they did not give us a reason. I am just assuming that that may be why. I know a lot of, like, if you wear anything FJB, I've heard you don't even get into Trump rallies and stuff like that.

So I'm assuming that's why, because we didn't even put like any FJB coin items in our application to them. So I'll keep you updated on that. We do expect to hopefully keep getting a bunch of applications back or approvals from all the applications we're filling out.

I'll keep you updated on everything. We haven't gotten any other denials. So I hope that it's just these people take a really long time.

Like when I heard from Noble US, I think they estimated like a few days and it's, I think like 48 hours or something like that. And it's been weeks. So it gives me a little bit more hope.

What else do we have coming up? Oh, the marketing wallet, the tax-free buys. We did not forget about that.

I promise it's not because I was lazy or because I was sick. What actually, what we had to do is we had a few people asking to unlock their wallets. So I did not, we unlocked their wallets and I did not want to start the marketing wallet buys and then have them dump on you all.

So I just wanted that to pass by. That's what I was telling you. There's some things we need to take care of before we run that, but we can start it as soon as you all want to tonight.

I'm pretty sure the wallets we unlocked have been dumped. I know the first one has. I haven't checked on the second one.

So that's all I was doing that for. I didn't want to, you know, get you all to buy from the marketing wallet and have that happen. So feel better doing it this way and it's better for all of you, but we can start that ASAP.

Just go ahead and DM me if you'd like to buy from the marketing wallet. We'll also have the 12 days of Christmas contest starting tonight. We're thinking for prices that we'll just do, and I don't know what you guys think of this, or maybe we'll have it be an option where you can have the option to have 20 or 25 bucks to the FJB store, or you can have FJB coins.

Maybe we'll give you that option. I'd prefer the FJB store because then you get to, you know, have a shirt or stickers or whatever it is you decide to have and kind of more of a gift to get in the mail, but maybe we'll leave it as I don't know in case some people don't want an FJB shirt or mug or something like that. We also have, oh this is another thing I actually wanted to ask.

We have, so Baby FJB has a donation, small donation. It's just what's been, you know, adding up in the donation wallet for, they'll have a donation ready for us before Christmas, by Christmas. So we were thinking instead of just writing out a check for 100 bucks, again I know it's a small amount, but you got to realize they, you know, haven't had a ton of buys and kind of just started all of this.

So 100 bucks or what have you. We're thinking instead of writing a check to a organization that we actually go somehow in the, like usually for Thanksgiving and Christmas, I either cook for homeless in the park or like I've done all kind of random stuff, you know, pass out bags, make bags for them and pass them out, like very random stuff, but more direct outreach versus going through organizations. So if you have any ideas on how to do something like that or not how to do, basically how to pick, like do we want to pick a family or do we just want to go out to, you know, parks where we know there are homeless at and just cook for them with that, you know, that 100 bucks could feed quite a few people.

But let me know any ideas in the chat or DM me if you have any better ideas. We think it would be better to kind of reach out that way versus just, you know, handing it over some money to a big organization. I'm hoping it goes a longer way that way and touches somebody personally.

Okay, let's see our website. Our website should be, let's see, should be very, should be updated. We still have some pages being edited, the text, but other than that, it's looking amazing.

Let's see if I hear back from Dogbone, our website developer. What else? Actually, I also have, whoops, sorry, is that better?

VES is also, that's weird, why can't I hear myself?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, let me see. Sorry, I just have to mute.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, VES is also editing some of the issues that you all, let me go into Discord, that you all mentioned in Discord. So they're actually, they're very thankful for that input. Some people said it's still a lot going on and very overwhelming with all the text when you first try to back up and get your recovery options set up.

Other people were saying that it does, it never clears, like there's some messages that even once you do whatever it asks of, it keeps asking that and you have to keep clicking it every time you go through. I know mine does that, but I honestly just don't go in there often, but I can imagine if you go in the app often, then you're dealing with that constantly. I'd rather just not look at my balance right now.

So they said they've just been very busy, but they're gonna get into Discord ASAP and start working on that. They said they'll be busy for the rest of the night. So it'll be either later tonight or tomorrow morning.

[Speaker 3]
Let's see, I think, I'm trying to think of anything else.

[Speaker 1]
I think that's all. We're still waiting on more applications. I'm super excited about the Amazon.

I think also, I don't think we've started, since we're doing the booths in person, I've started shopping for the physical parts of the booth, table and tent and all that. And I think it would be better for us if we find someone to do our shirts that we're selling in person, because I think that'll be just a lot better for us profit-wise. So I'll find somebody local.

I already have a few people, actually. I just need to reach out to again from when we first were gonna do merch, and I think that'll be better for our in-person events. Are the devs full-time on this project?

Velo is not. The dev we hired on right now is still a contractor, if that's what you're asking, but he is working. This is the only project he's working on until he gets it done.

Of course, that's as much as our budget permits. Winston says, better form of charity. Thank you.

I'm just catching up on this. When FJV treated like a winner and not a punk. This is a long-term project for Bannon and Boris.

I can assure you, they are not treating the FJV like a punk. They are not walking away. They just realized that we're in a bear market.

And again, just, you know, when I'm like, hey, the community really wants to hear it, they're like, well, it's a bear market anyway. All crypto is down. So it's, I assure you, this is just a very long-term project.

And you know, they're, they have time. I am getting them and letting them know how important it is for you. I have let them know.

I keep reminding them. I promise you that. Dogbone just posted two new pages for the website that are live.

Nice. I like that. And news one, got a news page and then the market page.

And a few more that are in the works are going to be really cool. I love it. So cool.

It looks so sharp.

[Speaker 2]
Subscribe. I haven't done that.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you for your message. It has been sent. Oh, you're welcome.

When do you project we'll have a serviceable app? Honestly, right now, like I said, we have a dev that's working on this full time. Whatever our budget permits.

I'm really hoping the buying from the straight from the marketing wallet tax-free helps. But whatever our budget permits, that it'll depend on that. We have the smart wallet, we'll have the FJB cards by Christmas, it's looking like.

And then we have like the bugs to work through. Like you, I hope it's sooner than later. It'll be also really cool to have, you know, a less clunky app of the website.

What do you guys think? I think Dogbone did an amazing job. How is budget established?

Well, it's more so the funds we have coming in from our 8%. And that's obviously the 8% from every transaction. So the more volume we have, and that's why, that's why FJB adding the FJB gift cards, although that's a nice chunk of cash, why it was so important.

Because we hope that really helps us with in-person rallies and just booths in general. Same with the merch. White paper and tax structure released pre-Christmas question mark.

By the new year is what we're shooting for, for the tax structure. The white paper, we are still waiting for B&B to decide whether they want the old white paper revised or the new one. We'll see.

I'm personally fine with the old one being revised. I think a lot of people liked a lot of what was in there, and I think we've already started getting a lot of what was in there completed. Russ says, gotcha, that's why I buy through Pancake Swap.

Unvaccinated. Who's vaccinated in Discord? I'm not.

FJB rocks. I don't even vaccinate my dogs anymore. Vaccinate your dogs once, and then you can do like a titters on them, and then you can measure actually how much vaccines you already have.

We've done that for one of my dogs, the youngest, before this, and six years later, he still has his, so just an idea. That way, even if you need it for like daycare grooming or something, you still have the paper showing that they still have the vaccines in their system. Winston says, well done on the website.

Yeah, it looks super sharp. I love it. That's a lot of the work that's been going on in the background, so thank you so much, Dogbone, and all the other volunteers who are putting in all the work in the back.

It's definitely appreciated. Sorry, Mark, I'm gonna mute you. I'm always nervous because when I mute someone, they go to the bottom, so I have to go check that I didn't kick them out.

Gwen Bannon, who officially endorses the project, officially endorsed FJB merch on War Room. Yeah, we just have to pay, actually, so we asked them to sign a few pieces, so we're hoping they do that, and then we just have to make sure that he doesn't have a contract with someone else, so like before when we had him put an FJB coin cardboard kind of mini poster behind him, he had to remove that because it was in one of his other contracts, so unfortunately sometimes it works like that, but it'd be nice if they sign a few items for us, too. Dogbone says, the daily voting link's on the website now in case you forget where to go. That's awesome.

Dallas says he can't endorse his own project. I think for contracts, that are already there is what I'm assuming. This was a long time ago.

I want to say, gosh, probably more than six months ago, if I remember correctly. If they already have a contract in place that says anything specific, then I'm not sure it matters, but contracts also expire, so let me see. Did Boris update his website yet?

[Speaker 3]
Nope. Is that that? I still have the XD banner on there.

What else? Let me see.

[Speaker 1]
I made a coffee and a Nespresso martini in case I don't get enough caffeine. I feel like today flew by.

[Speaker 2]
John Frederick's.

[Speaker 1]
What else?

[Speaker 3]
What else do we have going on?

[Speaker 1]
I'm just waiting to hear back from a bunch of people. I hate me and boring. Well, I think so.

The Noble, I need to know how to say that.

[Speaker 3]
I think it would be Noble US.

[Speaker 1]
Forget who it was, one of you sent it to me. I think right before Black Friday. Riva People USA says, doing an amazing job, sir.

Thank you. And you're doing an amazing job on the social media. I think I was looking at our Shopify store, and most of the traffic we're getting is actually from Twitter.

Now that Twitter is not shadow banning us.

[Speaker 3]
It's so strong.

[Speaker 1]
How is merch going? Good. We haven't had, I think our last order was two days ago.

And that's why I was thinking we should do that for the 12 days of Christmas, we should do like vouchers to the merch store, help keep that going. I think that'd be nice. And that way we can open it up to any open the contest up to anybody on social media.

And that way, if you guys want to show it, then hey, any of your friends can enter this contest and you can win, you know, 25 bucks, a shirt or shirt and some stickers or something like that. Any of the devs going to join a call? Understand you have raised this with Bella in the past and it was independent on his schedule.

Is everyone too busy? No, we can ask the other dev we just literally onboarded last night. We can ask him and I can ask Bella again, too, now that he has some help.

I know he's been super, super busy with work and his personal life, but we can definitely ask again. It was awesome having him on. Somebody says my heart's hat's pretty wicked.

I still haven't ordered mine because I was still waiting on what my husband wanted, but all he sent me was like critiques on the store. Oh, which by the way, we have been working on cleaning that up a little bit for easier viewing. Let me see.

It doesn't really give you much options, like not a lot we can control as far as that goes, but we did try to clean it up a little bit. Also put like the t-shirts on the home screen, but maybe we should move the categories to the home screen. I don't know what you guys think, but at least temporarily moved at least all the t-shirts to the front.

And then you can go to the FJB merch, which takes you to the collections. I suppose we could have the collections on the home page. I've been trying these on the rocks is what they're called, little mini bottles.

I think Raven or Lauren posted them once, and they're actually good because they're not sweet. Usually premixed drinks are so sweet. Free pan and trim contracts.

We got to tell Grace that. I think she takes care of that. Free Grace.

There was, I was looking at events to apply to that I was applying to earlier for in-person events here locally, and there was one that was an MLK merch, and I was trying to decide if that would be a good idea. We would love it. I'm not sure if we've been attacked.

When morning, what? Morning Micah? FJB chill.

Oh, bills are paid for the month, so that's always good. Our website and app aren't going down.

[Speaker 7]
Gen X says, yep, definitely, definitely would get attacked.

[Speaker 3]
What else?

[Speaker 1]
May have covered in first 10 minutes, I miss, but what is finance troubles looking like for us? We have to discuss that as late as today. Ultimately, the consensus is that most everybody thinks it'll die down.

It's just temporary, you know, in the news, something goes in the news cycle, and everybody's talking about it, what have you. But if we do move to a different chain, it would be a bridge to this coin.

[Speaker 2]
Go ahead and somebody posted in this optimism, but let me scroll up.

[Speaker 1]
So, that's an option. Evan says Cardano. What chain, what Cardano is?

Let me see. Is it, is Cardano on the ERC 20? So, that would be a lot easier for us, a lot more cost effective, which is kind of why we have it.

So, spending several inches is not, not really limiting. But Velo had actually suggested this one before all the Binance troubles in the news. So, we're just revisiting that, and it has come up a few times.

But again, we're thinking that it'll, it'll die down. If it doesn't, and it does become a more serious discussion, I'll definitely keep you all updated. Maybe that's actually what we can get Velo to come on and kind of discuss, because let's see.

We were talking about that earlier. Let's see. He mentioned like some of the benefits and how that would be good for us.

But again, it costs time, costs money. So, we'll see. But it's definitely an option.

We'll do whatever it takes, you know, like anything else. I mean, I know we've been through a ton and more than, I think, normal in a year's time. But we'll keep adjusting anytime we need to and keep moving forward.

The nice thing, I think, about having folks like B&B on is they're not new to any of this. They understand bad things happen, you know, unfortunate circumstances happen, whether to just, you know, finance, whatever's happening with finance and FXT, that's not really anything we can control or anything that was due to anything we did or didn't do or to stuff that's happened that's more directly and more specific with us. And I think the nice part about that is they've kind of done, you know, dealt with it all.

Maybe not in the same context, of course, in crypto or crypto project. But I think that's it's not the end of the world. And I think nothing we're going through is the end of the world for them or something they feel they need to walk away from or, oh my gosh, you know, this is too much for us to handle.

I think they've been through much more than that and realize that, all right, cool. All we can do is move forward and carry on. And I understand that's, like, easier said than done when you're in a bad place.

But like, there is, they're not quitting, they're not walking away, that's not an option. So yes, the market is down, but so is everything. So is real estate, so is the stock market, so is the whole crypto market.

You know, it sucks. But it's literally, it's a cycle.

[Speaker 3]
And just like it goes down, it'll go back up. So, let's see.

[Speaker 1]
It goes really low. I want as many coins as Bannon and Boyce have. Are Himalayan devs being considered?

Please say we're talking about it. I'm actually not sure who those devs are. But again, I don't do a lot of the technical stuff.

I'm learning, but very slowly. My brain can, so like in school, my favorite subject was always math. But now that it's like doing other stuff, it's like my brain can only think one way or the other.

If I'm doing numbers and more of that, like don't try to talk to me. And then vice versa. Like I can't, my brain can't function both ways at once.

I need to get in a different mindset. Oh, I saw a FXT guy got arrested. That was nice.

Let's see, what did the Fleet post? Interesting. I think this is straight from their legal papers.

Russ says, Carrie Lake wants some FGB. You know what? So, when she had her campaign here, I actually filled out their, you know, their online, their websites for volunteers.

And I never heard back, but I honestly think they just had way too many. Because anytime we went to her rallies, it was, I mean, thousands of people there. So, I should try reaching out to her again.

Maybe it slowed down a ton now that all the volunteers are gone. I'm going to add that to my list. Because I reached out to her, well, you know, not to her.

I'm acting like I know her personal phone number. I don't. I reached out and filled the application twice.

I actually filled out the application and then I emailed them and then sent them something on Twitter or Facebook and never heard back. So, I should reach out. And when I did the, I used to, like, post on her social media on Twitter a lot.

Sometimes on Instagram, too. But, definitely add that. She was trolling Katie Hobbs.

I don't know if you guys saw that. Looked like a picture of her at the Cardinals game last night. Russ says, awesome.

I'm waiting for the, um, Trump to announce his rallies. Last time I checked, they weren't announced yet for 2023. Let me see if there's a schedule out yet.

[Speaker 2]
Does anybody know? I looked everywhere last time. I mean, I guess it wasn't out.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Our new dev says he's currently deploying the contracts on the testnet and checking. Cool.

Hopefully, we'll have our testers back on to test the smart wallet to ASAP.

[Speaker 2]
Russ says Trump, Trump, Trump.

[Speaker 1]
What are turnbuckle pads? Oh, my gosh. Binance customer withdrawals exceed $3 billion in 24 hours.

[Speaker 4]
Let's see how the crypto, most of crypto got a little bump today, I think.

[Speaker 1]
I was looking at optimism earlier, so. Any update on the date for tax change? Definitely by the end of the year.

I would love it if it was by Christmas. And I think the, like, percentage is staying the same, but more of the tax structure. But that'd be super awesome.

[Speaker 2]
I'm very, very excited for it.

[Speaker 1]
Long term, when official launch, we'll probably need lower tax rate. True. Although, I mean, app is, you know, if you're using the app, you're good, right?

But yes, definitely agree, especially for businesses. And I don't think that'll be a problem once we have volume. I mean, look at what we did in the past year.

Insane. And look at what we did even before war. I think everybody here still, and I mean, everybody, a lot of people who've already sold are still nearby and watching.

And I think everybody sees the potential. We've just, you know, gone through some very unfortunate events.

[Speaker 3]
Winston says we call them creepers.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, if they want to buy back in, that's fine with me. They could be creepers all they want. And to be honest, I mean, if I sold, I'd still be watching too, because looking at, like, every other project I was in, like the smaller projects, I think every one of them has disappeared.

Any interest shown by Cortez, Pink Panther, or other war room frequents? Not that I know of. But again, those are people we can start reaching back out to again.

I've been so focused on, like, more so applications. But that's definitely, I think more and more, we've gotten a lot of help, which has been amazing. A lot of volunteers helping out a ton.

And as we continue to catch up, I think we're really getting in the flow of things, which is really awesome and really encouraging. Kind of heartbreaking, because I feel like, wow, we could have been doing this for so long with everybody being so talented and so helpful. But it is what it is.

What are you going to do? So Bannon has a conflict and MyPillow rejected FJB. Why are you going to the Hillbillys chats?

Well, I mean, we don't need to be here if you don't want to. Wasn't MyPillow, so it was my store, and they denied our application, I'm assuming, because it's FJB, you know, merchandise with FJB on it. But that's why we'll try again with just pro-America and not FJB and not F anybody else.

Hi there. I think that was Wolverine. FJB live price on website versus app.

Yep, all the app stuff will definitely, all the app bugs will definitely be settled. Very, very excited. I know we're slowly moving, obviously, with the, you know, limited budget and just starting completely over.

But I think we're really getting there. I think that's a great idea. And you know, I get it, like, because some of, so they asked us for to include pictures of a few items we have.

So I included a few shirts, I believe a candle and a hat. So even though it's FJB, you know, and I think the shirts I put on were specifically like actually with an American flag and Freedom Jobs Business versus FJB. But I get it.

And I'm assuming that they didn't have a reason listed in the email. So that's completely my assumption. Candle smells good.

Oh, awesome. That's good to hear. I used to love candles.

I mean, I still do. I wish I could burn them. I can't anymore.

[Speaker 2]
So I'm super jealous.

[Speaker 1]
Why does Bannon treat us like Redhead is Dead Child? You know what? Who knows?

[Speaker 4]
Maybe Bannon will get on a voice chat with us.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe if we get on Getter. I mean, we are on Getter, but if we do our voice chats on Getter, then he'll get on. He's not.

They just, they realize all we're going through. So they're like, okay, so, which I do get part of this. It's like, so you want us to get more people on board to be unhappy right now while we don't have our stuff figured out?

So I totally understand obviously what we're coming from. Because I don't, I don't like being way down on my money either. Like I know you all don't.

But I also get and understand where they're coming from. We're like, there's, there's no rush. It's a crypto bear market.

And, you know, we're working towards getting everything together. And now we have some legal stuff going on. So I hope that kind of helps and makes sense, a little bit more sense.

But we know like we did before, all it means is literally one, you know, one time unwarranted. And we'll have every time I think about those, you know, that one day of wire where I could barely keep up with the emails coming in. So it's just support emails coming in.

Hey, I'm trying to buy a butt, blah, blah, blah. Hey, I'm trying to buy a butt. You know, we just don't want to go through that again.

Bannon is not happy about that, I imagine. Dallas says, I'll transfer Bannon 1 million coins if he does call this week. Let's start a GoFundMe here.

Winston says, okay, Johnny, I'm in his box. I mean, same, to be honest. So are we matching that 1 million?

Oh, yeah. Russ says he'll match. I'll match it too.

I'll match it tenfold if that's the case. That's all we need. Maybe Discord will even match it too.

If you guys let them. Sam too. So what do we have now?

12, 13 million.

[Speaker 3]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. He's in the chat with Velo now. They could not match a selection of two.

[Speaker 7]
Winston said Discord only knows the sell button.

[Speaker 1]
You know what? I really disliked Discord in the beginning, like when I first got on it, because it was so confusing. But I wish Telegram was more organized.

That's the only thing. I wish Telegram had more, you know, the way Discord is. A little bit more like that.

But I hated Discord in the beginning for that same reason. It was all so overwhelming. Super low sell order on LBing.

Someone put in a small buy order. Oh, let me see. I don't think I have any funds in LBing though, honestly.

[Speaker 4]
I can transfer some over there. Let's see. I kind of want to do all my buys on Friday now though for the happy hour.

Let me see. Yeah, I don't have like 91 cents of Bitcoin. Let's see.

I want to do that now though.

[Speaker 1]
This Friday diet. Friday is going to be swapping. I know.

I was actually thinking of doing, giving the option of the marketing. Maybe we do the marketing buy option, marketing wallet buy option. That's a mouthful.

Like till the end of the month. We'll see. We'll see if we can get that approved.

Or maybe till Christmas. That's kind of a good, you know, till Christmas.

[Speaker 2]
Get a nice little idea.

[Speaker 3]
What else?

[Speaker 1]
I haven't been on Twitter to see if they still troll us like they used to when there was a bunch of bots. What else? Oh, we have TPUSA.

That starts this Saturday night. We haven't heard anything from them yet. It's actually on my to do list to email them again tonight.

But again, I know media passes usually come like two days beforehand. Like at the latest. Tim, that's so cute.

So we'll see. I'll update you on that. But we're supposed to leave town tonight, but it was snowing on the way there.

I don't know how you people who live in snow do it. So we might wait till tomorrow. I'll be back by Saturday.

So I really hope I hear back from them. I already have the order for the cards already. We just need to send them on.

They usually have it within a few hours if we need to be at the event or if we get tickets for it. That's a nice surprise, Tim. This page will help.

FJBFly needs a few more links. PancakeSwap may be global transacting. Yep, absolutely.

The website is so sharp and so beautiful. And they're still adding to it, which is amazing. The few pages that are being worked on right now are very more so educational.

And I think will be perfect for boomers. Looks amazing. Oh, we also heard back from a crypto company.

Well, okay, so they sell crypto gift cards, right? So they can't sell our gift cards because it's more like Bitcoin and bigger well-known coins. But we can add a link on our website or our app and we get 10 to 15 percent of the proceeds of anybody who purchases these gift cards.

I'm not sure if that'd be a good idea or worth it, but we can definitely try it. There's not really any crazy sign-up fees or anything like that, so there's not much for us to lose.

[Speaker 2]
So basically, yeah, I wonder if it would be nice to put on the app somehow.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are so talented. That's funny. Santa Sunday.

Where is this that they had to have a big snow there? I see the Discord telegram. Feud is still going, huh?

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, Discord is talking about crypto scans. Cat.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I know. Actually, P.G. Hold on. Okay.

P.J., I think. No, I think his name was like P.G. Tips before. I'm pretty sure.

He's been doing a lot of our graphics. So our newest shirt is actually a pretty good one, I think. I do think I want it in like curly colors, but I'll show it to you.

[Speaker 4]
I think I want like more muted purpley colors. I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
But here's a shirt. It comes in a bunch of other colors, of course, but I'm gonna ask if you can make it in some more like feminine colors. Not that red, white, and blue isn't awesome, but something more mellow.

[Speaker 2]
So I can wear it everywhere.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's a cute cat.

[Speaker 1]
Your story, by the way, rescuing those cats is so sweet.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think I've told you that, but I read that. I think you posted like a blog post once, Crazy Trucker, a few months ago.

[Speaker 4]
I want to say it was a blog post.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's how it works. Boss kitty. That's how it works.

The animals own you or rescue you.

[Speaker 4]
I know mine do. I've been giving mine whipped cream. Well, they love whipped cream from like, you know, when you go get Starbucks or something.

Yeah, I know they're woke, but they're like the least woke coffee place here.

[Speaker 1]
So I got heavy cream for the last few months and I've been making them whipped cream without the sugar so that they can have that since they love the whipped cream so much.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if cats like whipped cream too, but...

[Speaker 1]
Please pass on to whoever designed the coin logo medallion that on the marketing pages that they did an awesome job. Awesome.

[Speaker 4]
I actually am trying to remember if Dogbone did that.

[Speaker 1]
I think that may have been, but yes, I thought that looked amazing. And I believe we're getting that in like an actual coin, which will be really, really cool. The whole website looks really, really slick.

I love it.

[Speaker 4]
So sharp.

[Speaker 2]
Checker says, oh yeah, they do anything dairy really.

[Speaker 1]
I know I thought, oh, so I didn't know that, but somebody was talking about they love potatoes and I googled it and like, I guess a lot of cats are really obsessed with potatoes, which to me is so strange.

[Speaker 2]
Lactose intolerant, I assume, huh? No. No dairy.

[Speaker 5]
Ooh, Rescat merch. Show us, show us. I want to see what you get.

He said, he literally did get it then, huh? When bring your dog to FJV day? Yeah, that's a good idea.

[Speaker 1]
My big dog, uh, which is a, well, he's a golden doodle, but he's a black golden doodle because his mom was a black doodle. He likes, um, there's another bed in my office, so he likes laying on that. So when I do the calls, I kick him out because he'll usually like snore and fart and pant and do all kinds of stuff.

Crazy trucker says, live cam, we want to see Russ and his kitties with merch.

[Speaker 8]
I'm sure he'll be back. We should have him jump on a live video.

[Speaker 6]
Isn't that Russ? That's so funny. Oh my gosh.

I can't. Oh my gosh. I gotta stop looking at that.

That's so funny.

[Speaker 5]
I'm sorry, Ed. That's so funny.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my gosh. Oh, that's so funny. Oh my goodness.

I'm just imagining Russ.

[Speaker 5]
I'm imagining Russ in his FJV gear doing that. We need FJV boxers now. Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yay. He's gonna kill someone. Oh my gosh.

Oh, boy. Oh, yay yay.

[Speaker 5]
Let's wait on Russ. I don't want to get off waiting in anticipation now. Gosh, how far is your porch, Russ?

[Speaker 6]
He's still holding his gear.

[Speaker 5]
Well, he probably ordered everything in the FJV store, so maybe he's trying it all on and taking photos for us.

[Speaker 2]
Gosh, it's really sad, huh? Being cheaper than gas.

[Speaker 9]
I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's awesome. I love it. At first I thought you were holding the beer, Russ, but it's the candle.

That's amazing. Does it feel nice?

[Speaker 8]
We were all sitting here waiting for you in anticipation.

[Speaker 1]
No, don't apologize. We were just like, wow, we hope he's okay. His porch has to be pretty far.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know why I started typing back, but actually, for the gun holsters, my husband asked for that, too. I think that would be pretty awesome. I need one, too.

I actually don't have one. I never have. Cool.

You'll have to show us what else you get. Yeah, I'm excited.

[Speaker 1]
I really need to ask my husband for his order because I really need to put in my order because some of the brands I put the shirts on should feel super nice. The Bella and the Canvas ones and what was the other one? American Apparel, I think.

They should feel pretty nice.

[Speaker 2]
I'm excited to see. Awesome. Thank you for your support, Russ.

I'm sure I speak for everybody when we say we appreciate it. Crazy Trucker says, an electric start lawnmower, we hope. Well, I think that's all the updates I have for all you.

I think we went through all the questions. Again, please accept my apologies for Boris having to reschedule.

[Speaker 1]
I promise again that it's not because they're walking away from the project by any means. Again, liability is number one to Boris and Bannon. Obviously, Boris is an attorney.

If they were to walk away or even thinking about walking away or they would not have their name on anything, you all would be the first people to know. All their social media and websites would be updated and they would ask us to remove their names from everything. Similar to what happened with Finn.

When Finn decided to leave, honestly, one of the very first things he asked us to do is wipe everything of his name in any articles or anything like that, which is understandable. That's what high-profile people do. Again, even if nothing but for liability purposes.

So, I do appreciate your patience and your grace. It does not go unnoticed. I am so, so sorry.

I promise I'm trying my hardest and it's not that they don't care. It's just that, you know, Boris has this, like, 2-3 hour slot every day and that's his FJD slot and I think a lot of stuff is taking much longer. Every time we think he's wrapping it up, more stuff comes up.

But, I promise you we will get him on a... Russ shared that again. That's too funny.

You guys need to go into Telegram if you listen to this later to look at the GIFs they're posting. Ooh, look at Gen X. Actually, I like that shirt too.

Maybe we should have some shirts like that. Those are the shirts we've probably put on the MyStore because they're not, like, FJD-related and more so just, like, you know, pro-America and MAGA and Patriot-related. So, I'm really hoping.

The nice thing is about the MyPatriot or the MyStore application is they actually got back to us a lot quicker than they said they would, which was I think they estimated 4-6 weeks and we just applied to them maybe a week ago. I want to say less than 2 weeks, definitely. So, at least we have that.

But, yeah, again, thank you. Thank you so much for your patience. If you do have any suggestions or any ideas for the baby FJD donation on Christmas or, you know, around Christmas, if you have any, like, cool ideas to donate to, say, a family or something like that, please reach out and let me know.

But, I think right now, the idea is that we will do something like that more personal and, of course, document it all and share it with you all. So, please let me know of any ideas you have. I think that would be great.

And we're coming, I mean, what? It's December 13th. Okay, so we have less than 2 weeks till Christmas 12 days.

So, yeah, please let me know if you have any ideas there. Please DM me if you'd like to purchase straight from the marketing wallet without zero tax to prevent us from having to sell any coins to keep funding all the, you know, overhead costs. Winston says, we got Amazon, Linda, better step up with my store.

I would rather Boris be a lawyer than talk to us but I understand why some need to hear his manly voice. Oh, and website updates. Yes, absolutely.

I completely understand and I 100% understand, especially after everything we've gone through the past year, which, again, I wish I could give you more details of that would make it clear up a lot more things to you. Unfortunately, we can't for the time being, but I understand why, you know, some of you may not trust me saying that I promise Ben and I and Boris are still on the project. I do not take that personal.

I completely understand why you feel that way. Again, I do promise you they are both still here. They are not running or walking away from the project and have no intention of doing that or shutting us down.

But we will get them on here. And I am so sorry again that Boris had to reschedule. Cool.

Awesome. Well, thank you all so much. Long call.

Yes, I know. It's like starting was funny. I say cold, but it's probably like 60 degrees out, but for me, that's cold.

We need to go walk like the dogs at night and it's way too cold. But thank you all so much for your patience and grace. Please DM me if you need anything else.

Otherwise, I'll be here. I have a lot of coffee because we still have a lot of work to do tonight. And we will do our regularly scheduled call on Friday.

I'll do it from up north. Thank you all so much. Have a wonderful night.
