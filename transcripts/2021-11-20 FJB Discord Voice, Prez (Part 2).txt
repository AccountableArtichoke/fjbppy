Disconnect this bad boy. It's a busy day, man. Freaking Saturday flew by and it doesn't even feel like Saturday.

(0:08 - 0:32)
It's pitch black outside. I haven't been outside all day long. I've been getting this thing done. 

You can hear me? It's funny. He posts the best ones. That's hilarious. 

You guys can hear me? Yup. Yup. Yup. 

Awesome. We got how many people we got? I'm going to make this one quick because I know that, one, we got things to do, and that's going to be to chill. That's going to be definitely to chill.

(0:33 - 0:39)
Two, I got some calls to make, too. Some late night Saturday night calls. We're going to be good.

(0:39 - 0:43)
So we got how, 79? Let me get one more second until we get 80. We just need 80. That's all we need.

(0:43 - 0:50)
That's all we need is 80. Post this over here. Post in the telegram.

(0:50 - 0:54)
Send on voice. On voice now. Boom, boom, boom.

(0:57 - 1:38)
81. Perfect. What's going on, everybody? How are we? How was your Saturday? I know it was crazy because it gets dark out so early now, but just wanted to hop on tonight really quickly. 

Not many updates from this morning. I talked to you guys just a couple hours ago, so not bad, but hey, it's a Saturday. I checked the price actually for the first time today. 

I had a meeting with a lawyer and another phone call, trying to figure some things out on this end, and we're figuring it out. We're doing really well, but that's the best part about it is I checked the price, wasn't stressed at all, got some direct messages from some people that were stressed. My response, all it is is, and Drew Solo hit it perfectly.

(1:39 - 1:48)
I want Drew to come up here too because it's a Saturday, and he said, hey, it's my fourth Saturday doing this. I'm immune to it by now. People just take their weekend money.

(1:48 - 1:52)
We have swing traders. They come in here for a week. Then they get out.

(1:52 - 2:14)
They say, you know, it's time to cash out. The thing that's just crazy to me is they're selling basically for pennies. We haven't even hit a cent yet. 

This thing, with the news that's coming and everything on the way, we're 29 days old, first of all. With everything on the way, this thing is going to fly. It's like, hey, yeah, you can make your beer money now, but do you want beer money now or do you want to own Budweiser? That's the thing that kind of blows my mind.

(2:14 - 2:26)
Just a little bit silly to me, to be honest. It's okay. People have their own provocative. 

They have their own things that they want to do, their own trading plan. I'm not telling you guys to buy. I'm not telling you guys to sell.

(2:27 - 2:40)
I'm just giving you my forecast and my forecast is we're going a lot higher from here. I wish I could tell you exact figures. I can't do that because I don't see the future, but I know what's in the pipeline and I know what's coming.

(2:40 - 2:52)
I wish you guys just couldn't see into my head for just a second because you'd be damn excited. What happened today? Turok, he's in our chat. You want to come up here and talk to us for just a second if I would love to have you up here.

(2:53 - 3:09)
What you've been doing is absolutely incredible. Because of that, where is the channel itself? I guess I'll just do the donation tracker at Turok. I post this from my phone while I'm talking.

(3:12 - 3:23)
Thank you. Do this. Because of Turok, because he's so incredible, he just came up here to speak.

(3:23 - 3:31)
I just tagged you and I just donated $500 to Breast Cancer Portrait at Turok. He sent me that donation. He sent me that charity.

(3:32 - 3:41)
He's been doing fantastic work this past week. What we're going to start doing as a member of the week, we're going to pick somebody that goes above and beyond. Goes above and beyond shilling, goes above and beyond whatever they're doing.

(3:42 - 3:49)
I'll donate $500 of my own money to it. That's what I did today. Great, great, great foundation.

(3:51 - 3:57)
I did a little bit of research on it, but Turok, you're up here. You want to say something? That's amazing, Prez. Thank you.

(3:57 - 4:22)
I think as soon as everybody realizes that this is not just a shitcoin for fun and giggles and games, but this is a movement about real Americans, hardworking men and women that are fed up with this bullshit and getting behind this coin is a way to right this shit. That's it, man. Thank you.

(4:23 - 4:31)
Much appreciated. Thanks for coming over here, Turok. I know that $500 is going to do a lot of good, and I'm excited to be here for weeks.

(4:32 - 5:05)
52 plus weeks we're going to be doing this, at least. I'm excited to be here doing this every Saturday. I'm going to be donating $500 a week, and I don't want to tell my mom that because she'll definitely be upset that I'm doing that, but that's why I love this. 

That's why I'm doing this, is to help others. This is absolutely incredible, which is awesome. Drew, you're up here too. 

You want to say something? Hey, what's going on? What's going on? How are we doing today? Boss, how are you? I'm doing good. How are you? I'm great. I just checked the price. 

People selling? Fine. It's okay. I ain't worried.

(5:06 - 5:10)
That's fine. That's fine. Look, for everybody who's worried, don't be.

(5:10 - 5:13)
Look at that chart. Look at the 12-hour chart. We're not trading minute volatility here.

(5:13 - 5:26)
This is a long-term hold here. It's a Saturday. Remember what happens on Saturdays? Saturdays. 

I call them bloody Saturdays. This is my fourth one. I got in here October 29th, I think it was, Friday, the day before.

(5:27 - 5:32)
Day after, on the 30th, boom, dropped 50%. It keeps happening. Guess what? We didn't drop 50% today.

(5:33 - 5:37)
This is the best Saturday of all the Saturdays. It's the best Saturday yet. It was actually a win.

(5:37 - 5:52)
Today was a win of a Saturday, which is awesome. Right? This was the best one yet. Saturdays happen. 

It happens. I actually, after I picked up the phone this morning, or the voice, I was like, you know what, we're probably going to have a sell-off because it's Saturday. I was like, actually, I'm jinxing myself because we're actually doing pretty well.

(5:53 - 6:09)
I was in a Zoom meeting, and I just see my phone blowing up. I'm like, oh, what the hell is going on? I pulled it up in the back, and I was like, geez, Louise, of course this happens. I'm not worried. 

Like you said, I love the 12-hour chart. Zoom out, see what we're doing. What we're going to do tonight is, we haven't done this in a little bit.

(6:10 - 6:21)
I think it might have been last Saturday or the Saturday before, we had a huge dip. You know what we did? We came back, everybody in the group, and I know you guys are tired. I know you guys are shilling all day long. 

Your fingers are hurting. Two ideas. One is, Phil G sent me an idea.

(6:21 - 6:30)
He said we all take, and we all post the same thing, tagging the same people. So I'm posting this right now in the announcements. This is a click to tweet. 

Easy. You tweet, tell somebody else to tweet. That's an easy one.

(6:30 - 6:43)
What we're going to do tonight, though, that's kind of hard. I want everybody on board, every single person. We're trending on StockTwits again. 

We're going to trend on StockTwits. That's what we do. We get up there, we go forward, and we trend on StockTwits.

(6:43 - 7:05)
So everybody, we've done this before. It's not rocket science. It's not hard to do for us. 

We've done this. We've become number one on StockTwits. Let's do that again. 

Let's get on there. Let's get on StockTwits. Let's start trending again because that's how you get the name out. 

That's how you get us noticed, and that's how you get us more holders. Let's get to 7,000 holders by the end of tonight by trending on StockTwits. Everybody, I'm making this short and sweet.

(7:05 - 7:20)
Get your ass on StockTwits right now, and let's get this thing trending because I know I'm going to be on there shilling. So if I'm on there shilling, everybody else has to be on there shilling because I'm not taking a break until this thing's on the moon. I'm hanging up now, so now tweet that, tell somebody else to tweet that, and then let's get this thing going on StockTwits.

(7:21 - 7:22)
See you guys at number one.
