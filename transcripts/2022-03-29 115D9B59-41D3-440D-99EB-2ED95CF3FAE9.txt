[Speaker 1]
This community so unbelievably much however, I can do more and I haven't been doing more and I'm sorry and I and I wish that I have been and I Told you guys back in in December when when this whole thing happened that I Was never going away and I was never leaving and I never will I could be the last person how many people we have in This discord over almost 7,000 people there could be one person left and it'd be me I would not leave I I you literally can't get rid of me I'll eat hot dogs until the cows come home because I love you guys so unbelievably much this this project That has come such a far way and we have such a long way to go and I already think it's a tremendous success but I know that the sky is the limit and this has been such a life-changing event and something that that we'll never forget because This is so much bigger than what you started out as a coin back in October And we have this this app it which is like the fruition of all of the hard work all of the the shilling events all of the donations we've made all of the friendships that we've had and Even playing chess with each other or playing jackbox or whatever. It may be It's all coming to fruition with this app. And I know that people can get upset people can get worried and at The basis of it all they want is some transparency and I haven't been able to provide that for for a lot of it because again, I don't own the project however any information that I can get I will happily tell you guys and It's not like I've been withholding or not telling you guys as much I just haven't been doing as much as I can and my day one energy I've been I've been trying to bring it back.

It hasn't been as strong as it should be But it's back day one energy is back and we are firing this thing up and I think you guys have seen Even if it's silly Those the eating videos or whatever. I may post in the announcements just because This is what you guys love, you know, and I mean like I love posting those videos and doing that I love going and getting like a big egg and cheese Because it's gonna make you guys smile and I don't know why you guys are you guys are funny You know what? I mean that you guys like to see that but I'll I'll go to the depths of hell to Make you guys happy.

You know what? I mean to make this project succeed because I Love you guys, and I love this this project and this has become so much more than just a coin So you're probably all wondering What's going on with the app? Exactly.

Wait, I went with one slice instead of three Yeah I got some more dog see but the good thing the thing that I can tell you is this and I'm not gonna set timelines because I'm bad at them and and I'm also not the the developer. So or the one coding it so I don't I don't understand coding I Went to a technical school. I took coding classes.

I couldn't tell you one percent of code I don't know how I got through those classes. However We have some people that can legitimately code a whole computer. They can do everything front back left, right?

They are American Made patriots that love this country and that love the idea behind this coin We had developers in the beginning and they were like kind of on the fence like you know What like I don't know if this projects for me FJB sounds a little bit too crazy for me. We found one developer who found another one and then found a whole team now and Basically when we asked them if they were up for the challenge, they said let's go They were immediately excited like absolutely excited and Since then they have not let up. It's hit a little beef Saturday at 3 a.m. And they're asking questions about code and What that just goes to show is how tremendous We are as people because sometimes like you lose feet you lose faith in community and you lose faith not in this community But in the community in general like in your everyday world I watch TV sometimes and I'm like, how how do people think like that? people like go about their days and I'm like, how are people such shitty human beings and then you see people in FJB you see people in This community and you're like this gives me reassurance in Humanity to be honest and Ryan actually just posted I'll tell you guys this I've done app development before it took about a quarter million At the time to get it off the ground. It's not easy It takes time and you need a good team. There will be bugs.

There will be issues, but it will work out Absolutely. I could not have said it better myself Basically, I Can assure you that the eating is going to come to an end very soon. I've heard within the week Within the week means the next seven days the next seven rolling days.

Can I give you an exact time frame on that? I know to rock. I know you're talking about hot dogs, too You're at a point where you're probably coming to your your clothes with hot dogs, too.

Hey Swan I don't want to hear any anything from you. I'm not giving timelines. I'm just saying within a week That's what I'm not.

Hey, I'm not I'm not saying anything specific You know, you're like what is uh, what is Jordan Belfort saying on his boat when he says it's it's in the ballpark range And and the SEC guys like can you say that just just how you said it and it's the same thing I'm not good. I'm not giving it. I'm not giving a timer.

I'm not giving you anything, you know All I'm saying a ballpark Frank's. I like that. I like ballpark Frank's however However, however, however, I can I can assure you from the latest that I've gotten from our dev team Was I was talking to them tonight was that it's within the week.

There are some minor bugs that they're fixing However, that's for the first Real version of this there's going to be many working versions of this So I want you guys not not I want you guys to hear me out and to hear the team out Is it gonna be a thousand percent right at the first shot? Yeah, everything's gonna work smoothly. Everything's gonna work great However, it's gonna be things that add on and keep moving forward throughout this process and there's been a tremendous Roadmap and white paper that was sent out Please if you haven't read that read that again because it was really in-depth and Fantastically done and outlined everything and I'm sure anybody in here is right the white paper that has read the road map can be pretty dang excited about it because I Haven't seen a white paper or a roadmap in the crypto world like that ever and I've seen a lot of them I've seen a lot of them. A lot of them have a lot of fluff and a lot of BS and Before they even post it the projects in the gutters You've been around for over a hundred hundred fifty hundred sixty hundred seventy days Somebody said what's up with Bannon? Is he still involved?

Absolutely. Actually, they ask questions all the time They they they are working as well Boris and Bannon do not stop They Eric Finman is still apps. I'm actually in a group chat with Eric from been talking to him right now these people are Some of the best in the business, whatever they do.

They are the some of the best in the business and For them to be leading this like I was literally watching the news before and I saw a Steve Bannon being mentioned and I was like eating dinner watching the news. I hate watching the news to be honest and I saw a Steve Bannon pop up and I was like, I Know that guy. I was like, that's pretty awesome.

I just kind of laughed I was like this sometimes it kind of just hits me and I'm like, this is really tremendous Like what what what a life, you know what? I mean? Like this that and and it also hit me too.

I know that We as a community can get I guess a little bit fortunate because remember when Steve Bannon and Boris came in here and talk to you guys You guys had literally like a direct line like you you have a direct line to One of the most important people in the world like and when Trump was president Steve Bannon was One of the most important people in the world and he is a probably one of the smartest people in the entire world, too And we and you guys were listening to him in a private discord session Like that's the type of things that like blows my mind. I'm like you guys are so fortunate like you guys are so lucky Boris is an absolute stud in this industry and You guys get to hear him speak and go on war room and talk about this Eric Finman is the buddy who's on Tosh point out He was he is the first Bitcoin millionaire and I'm like look at this team that we got We have Ryan posting in the chat right here. This guy's got millions of followers around the world I felt this guy when I was in high school like oh My god, I'm like look how crazy like this is the degree of separation that we have is just tremendous And I've never seen any crypto project like that in my life and Somebody asked will the marketing start as soon as the app launches.

Absolutely. We've been we've been meeting with marketers we've been meeting with people To get this thing revved up immediately when the app drops and Continue to keep the foot on the gas. It's just not going to be hey your car goes zero to 60 miles an hour and just a second and Then it runs out of gas now this thing is this thing is gonna keep going keep putting the foot on the gas and it's Gonna keep moving forward Somebody says describe the burn.

Yeah, so I'm gonna start just taking questions I like to talk if you guys haven't noticed this about me. I like to talk Describe the burn Yeah, so essentially the burn is Going to be based on whatever the available supply is at the time So, let's say for example, that's like the available FJB that's In the Treasury is like over a billion coins right now. I think it's like 1.1 billion coins this slow burn is Going to be like 1% of the purchases made through the app will go towards that burn So if that makes sense, let's say you're buying like a hundred coins. One of those coins will be burned So that's if that makes sense so the supplies know this way go the supply is not changing when I said that the The supply is currently over 1 billion. That's like the number of coins that are like it's the float It's the number of outstanding coins in the market so like if you were able to buy if you're gonna go buy a coin you're buying from The Treasury float right now if that makes sense I saw somebody post a picture of me with with some McNuggets Yes, the number of coins in the PCS liquidity exactly spite Let's see, let's see, let's see I'm reading I'm reading I'm reading Jake said so app latest in a week. I said that within the week is is the is the goal I will not give a date on that. So we are going to When whatever information I get I'm gonna tell you From the team.

I also am getting to a point where I just I can't I need to slow down the eating I posted a throwback video today of me eating ice cream because I was like I'm taking a day off because my stomach's gonna start hating me, but tomorrow I'll get back on it I'll do something. Maybe I'll do something spicy. Who knows?

Maybe I'll just eat a Frank. Who knows? Somebody's pictures are unbelievable, but What other questions we have I'm trying to catch up on it Well, the first version of the app be released in the first seven days include a fully functional Fiat on-ramp.

Yep the first version of it Will be fully functional. So you guys will be able to use it and it's gonna be fully functional in That sense. So if I'm trying to catch up on it, I Have all these messages here the one chip challenge I was looking at the one chip challenge and it was like I try to buy it on Amazon and it was first I was like $50.

I was like for one ship. I'm like, that's unbelievable. I don't know how the hell they do that Tell us about the marketing plan.

Yes glassy what's going on man? It's more than just a war room I'm not gonna shed more light than that But I can assure you it's gonna be more than just a plug-and-play on war room We had the team has been sending up interviews with some publications some outlets we have I Don't want to say who they've worked with but the PR team that we have has done PR for some pretty damn amazing people And some pretty important people and exactly someone said don't release the app on April 1st Actually, that was one of the conversations we had and we're like, okay We can't we can't do April 1st because everyone's gonna think it's a joke Yes, so somebody's asking questions about XT Sending XT coins to the app where that's what the goal of the FGB app is to be a native wallet for FGB Staking I will follow back on that.

We don't have anything like I Can't give any more information on staking right now. That's something that we've been working on. It's probably down the pipeline I See I miss you man, I haven't seen your name pop up here in a while I'm reading I'm reading I'm reading I'm reading.

I said what we did As well like when the app does fully come out you guys will understand completely more about how you exchange the coins from the app to Wallet wallet to app back and forth back and forth, you know Will you start posting crypto tick tocks? I do not post tick tocks I think I I I only asked that somebody posted a tick tock about wag and that made my day and I whenever I'm feeling Down I go back and watch it, but I will not be an influencer. That's that is not for me Yes, crock loves fuego.

That's the you want to know like the real reason why we've been held up so long For the app is for dark mode. We've been waiting this whole time for dark mode I'm absolutely kidding. If you guys don't don't know that That's it's not a real thing.

Okay, somebody asked about Q coin and I think I've I think I've cleared the air on this But I will clear the air again about Q coin Q coin is not an American company. It's not an American exchange Because of that a play by their own rules We had talks with Q coin extensive talks they loved our project in the beginning What they do what they did to us and what they do to other coins to their young is They get you in this talking stage. They get you in this contractual stage and then basically They don't pull the rug from you, but they say oh, well if you want to list with us it's gonna be X amount of dollars and some of you guys would probably throw up if you if you heard how much it was and When that happened, we're like, well, why don't we just make our own app?

Why don't we just make our own thing? That's American made because that's not American made and that's what FJB is about. It's freedom jobs in business not in China Not in Korea Not in Russia.

It's freedom jobs in business in America. So like yeah, we love we love our exchanges We love XT L Bank for what it is But that's not American made like every if you look back to Trump's presidency and that's like Where we try to model what we're doing because Trump's presidency this country was fantastic We were bringing jobs back to America. We were bringing things back to America.

That's what we're doing Yeah, Barley posted a Q coin listing is 800 K is actually 850 K I remember I saw that number and I was like, I'm that makes me want to throw up $850,000 to list with Q coin and What they do with that you want to know a little secret about that, too the developers of those exchanges Make you send them coins so they can quote-unquote like monitor the float They pump and dump the crap out of the coin. So a lot of these new coins.

They don't care about the community No, they don't care about the holders Hey, you pay them all that money if you're that successful enough to pay that money and you go list with them It might pump because they'll like basically artificially pump and then dump their share of coins So that's a little trick that you guys would hear about Q coin a little inside secret I'm seeing some more things about Yep, Q coin will come with those of me exact screw Q coin, but in short I'm looking at some more questions to do to do They rock of crypto.

I will say I will say your name. I Love you. I'll say I'll say that too Anymore let's if you have some questions, please tag me And it'll be it'll be very awesome.

Are you saying? Okay salty surfer, dude Are you saying buying it is finance the same way you're talking about like finance that u.s. That exchange they oh Man finance, let's think back. They wanted like 1.2 million to list on I'm not and then I'm not even kidding What about Google Analytics tracking scripts will they be removed from the app at some point see I'm not sure about that one Universal Fund I will get back to you on that But I will definitely Circle back on that one I'll see said our donations still going to be a part of the project can't remember what the white paper said about the new tax Yes, so the new tax in the white paper is going to be Basically having a tax for project management and part of that a big thing that we built on was donations And that's the reason why I started this coin was the donation piece and I remember speaking on the phone with the post millennial on November 18th, I remember the date talking about the donations and he basically the the reporter asked why did you start this coin and I was like to be honest like I saw this movement going on and I know that Republicans love to help people and I was like there has to be a way for this movement to help people and that's what I wanted to do and I the donation part is my favorite part of this coin and we I really do think we're gonna be planning on donations in the future because I think that's what the backbone of this coin is and Speaking of that.

I went down to Texas for that helicopters for heroes event And we donated $20,000 to and there's me people say that it was fake But it was definitely down there in Texas because of the donation. I Have never felt like that strong And like proud of proud about like what we've done until I got there Seeing all these veterans there was I don't know the exact number but hundreds of maybe even a thousand Total veterans that were in and out that weekend and just hearing their stories and hearing how Hello that some of their lives were after volunteering Ives for this country and then coming home and being treated like nothing and Seeing these people and like real-time and seeing how incredible they are I Donated more money while I was there at my own pocket because I was like, this is unbelievable and that's what like this coin did and I was like This coin is so much bigger than me you all of us It's helping out people that need it and I wish you guys could all see that. I wish you guys were all there Being able to see just how incredible those people I'm getting on a soapbox now. Just that was just a really unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable

[Speaker 2]
Thing that we're talking about

[Speaker 1]
Our league just said about to post swap testing from today with the BSC scan attached that's pretty Incredible So, yeah Lucas you said Lucas one three five and then it's 930 already So I have to actually happen another thing, but He says is my understanding When we say app we talking about web app I'm not expecting an app in the Apple I store on this door First iteration is going to be a web app from the web app, you can essentially wrap that quote-unquote wrap that and Bring that into the Android Android slash iOS App app store application store. That's the next step There's a like an approval process for that That's like you have to jump left and then right and then touch toes it's a it's a process so in the Short term, it's the web app.

The web app gets wrapped It's basically package it up and you bring it into the Apple slash iOS store it's why we're freedom jobs in business because we'll get approved and then we're gonna be in the app store themselves I'll take another question. So it says is the target goal still to be a top 50 crypto coin? I'm not gonna comment on that.

We're just gonna do the best that we can work our asses off and Let let God take it. That's that's basically where I'm at in life or just it's in God's hands. It's in God's plan All right, I'll take I'll take another question one more and then we'll clip it I'm scrolling up I'm trying to find What we're seeing I see some when Online Somebody asked about merch Merch will be coming with this as well.

It's gonna be all integrated essentially, I'll give I'll give the basically the Complete rundown of what the app and goal is the we're creating this FJB This FJB App I was gonna say web app, but it's also a phone app. We're creating this FJB app This is the last thing I'm gonna like really get into because this is exciting It basically be the bridge to get 74 million plus people that voted for Donald Trump in 2016 into crypto Into the blockchain defy space because it's such an incredible space But the thing is there is such a hard barrier to entry if you were to give somebody like a phone Already downloaded with coinbase and said go buy a Bitcoin I'm sure that like most people over the age of 40 couldn't do it.

That's not a knock at those people it's Pretty unbelievable that it's this hard. So what we're doing is we're creating this all-in-one centralized space For you to be able to have this crypto wallet, it's so easy It's so conservative and at the same time very user-friendly Well, you have in there and the goal is going to be an NFT marketplace. It's going to be even Retailers such as my pillow or whatever that maybe it's in the works things of that sort It's going to be even merchandise things.

It's an all-in-one Marketplace essentially, that's what the FJB coin is going to do It's going to be tremendous. It's going to be awesome Somebody said is any retailers on board yet? Like we've mentioned we're working on a few that's gonna come hand-in-hand with the app and doing all of that Our league actually just mentioned a message before in here saying that the testing is Going to be coming on very soon Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see Some people are asking about specific wallets again. I'm not in charge of those wallets and I wish that I could give answers However, I can't give answers right now If I do find out information Some people are messaging about it Then I will pass on that info in short. That's like the best answer that I could give Let's see, what measures are the team implementing to withstand cyber attacks that's been Exactly.

Somebody just said what kind of security will there be for this app? That's been a big like Aspect of creating this app is we're double-check it double chopping checking triple checking quadruple check every single thing about this to make sure that This is going to be tremendously secure because I know we all know That some liberals or whoever may be people in China people in Russia are going to try to hack it This is going to be extremely structurally safe and to be backed.

I I Don't even know how many statements of work. It's gonna be however It's going to be perfectly Set up and perfectly safe for all of us. I Can tell you guys that this thing is going to be very very safe Do not worry about it.

That's what we are. That's what we are doing That's what we are Figuring out that's also part of the reason why we're so delayed and as I say that Just know that the app is coming Our league just posted something I'm going to say at everyone so everyone sees I want to thank you guys all for Everything tonight. I miss talking to you guys.

I Haven't had one of these in a long time and I Way go. I just I just mentioned that I I hope I answered all of your questions. I hope that I Specifically talked to you guys and Somebody I'll answer one more.

So somebody said no burn of the Alban coins The coins that are only going to be burned are going to be the ones that are associated with the app. So it's only app Some said someone said some of us are getting a blank screen
