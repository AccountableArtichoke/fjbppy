[Speaker 1]
Hello. Happy Tuesday. Gangsta rap.

All right. I hope everybody's doing well. I hope you all had a wonderful Father's Day.

I know most of you are fathers. Hopefully, you got to spend some quality time with your kids and families, maybe your dads, like I did. I hope you all had a wonderful Father's Day.

All right. So I just wanted to hop on here. A lot of people were asking if we had any kind of timeline idea.

Right now, we, the dev with the third parties should be done by the end of the week. If this changes, I will keep you updated. Again, this is just tentative.

We're only sharing it because I've gotten many questions in the chat and DMs asking for any timeline. This is a timeline we have. So, sharing that with you so you know as much as we do.

Again, if this changes, I will keep you updated. So. All right.

As far... Yeah. So feeling really good about that.

Again, I think we all will, I'm confident, we will love these changes. It's most, if not everything, you've all asked for. I saw somebody earlier today say, like, an LP lock.

This is a much, a much bigger deal, I think, with a lot more details. Moving forward, I know you've all, well, some of you have probably realized the rooms have been ... Okay, I'm going to stop reading the chat because I'm getting distracted.

The chat rooms have been a little bit more moderated. Moving forward, that will be ... we're going towards that direction, or back towards that direction is what I should say.

We've all had, I think, plenty of time to vent and with the upcoming updates and moving forward, we'll treat this like a place that newcomers, whether it's, you know, people looking to buy into FJB or future partners are coming in to check everything out. So please don't take this personal, but I think, like I said, we've had enough time to vent. You all, I'm sure, are aware of all the other side chats that you can vent in, but that, we're putting that in the past as far as the official FJB and Patriot Pay chat rooms, the telegrams and discords go.

Again, don't take this personally. I think you're all family now, but it's for the best interest of the coin, the holders, and everybody in coming to check it out. If you need to take a break, you know, do so.

If you need to sell your coins, do so. We'd hate to see you go, but again, no wallets are locked, so we're not doing any of that funny stuff. We haven't for a very long while since the old team stepped away.

So kind of wanted to share a little bit of that and what direction we're going through, especially once these changes do take place and we have the foundation to start all brand new and fresh and start building everything and moving forward. Mods will be available to, of course, help with all that, and again, if you have any questions, always feel free to ask those or DM one of the mods. Okay, I think I can go back to the chat.

Who's okay with Sarah giving away everything? See, we even thought about that, but actually, there's some traders that are still messing or trading FJB. So those people are still watching and yeah, that's all I'll say.

We'll discuss that further in the future when we're live.

[Speaker 2]
Um, one airdrop? What are you airdropping?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I think Sam just got that tag. Okay, so yeah, I will keep you updated even as far as tonight. We should be hearing some updates tonight.

I will keep you all updated, but we are so, so close and really on the last possible step. I'm excited for some changes. Close to what?

Uh, close to announcing everything the team's been working on with you all. No, if everything is completed this week, like we have been told, like the team has been told, then we will be able to launch this week. I'm not sure, Nolan.

I am not answering those questions. Two years, how's it going with that? I will update you anytime I get updates to share with the community from Boris.

And for everybody on the call, that's uh, I'm assuming regarding the missing funds. All right, um, yeah, I think that's everything. You'll see some changes with the chat rooms, um, and then we'll get all our social media and websites as soon as we can.

I don't know why you guys are all my favorites. I'm assuming we launch this week. If that happens, when are we getting B&B on voice?

Um, that is not up to me and that answer has not changed. Uh, Boris said we will discuss that once, uh, basically once we have our stuff together. Okay, let's see MTV members.

You are all favorites. Universal fun. Also, there's a lot of people I haven't seen in a while that'll pop up in DMs. Let's see. It is fun looking at some of the stats in here because you guys are from all over, probably the probably all the VPNs, though, because I don't imagine. I know we have a few people. Top members.

Flute was the top member in the last week. What stats are saying? Flute, Nolan, Pierre, Russ, and Winston.

That's Telegram's, uh, top five from this week. Oh, and I guess Voodoo Child. Oh, I don't even know.

No, the dev is not working on the app, Johnny.

[Speaker 2]
North Korea.

[Speaker 1]
Can't say I've been there. I'm still not Gran's mom. Although that was, apparently that exploded into a little bit more than a joke.

Or stepmom. I think it turned into stepmom. What, when will the new website be released?

Um, once that, that, uh, logo is complete. Um, it's like, we've got some very, very tiny details. Let's see if I can spell that smart wallet.

Is branding complete? What's the logic in holding?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think I just answered that.

[Speaker 1]
Um, yeah, I think you'll really love the logo. I think, um, I think it's perfect. For our identity.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I just got a tip on Discord. 1FJB. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
I know, I'm so rich now. I can, uh, I can give it to you, Universal Fun. I forget what your Discord handle is.

Let's see. It's not Universal Fun.

[Speaker 2]
All right, um, Discord is scary.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think most people we got from War Room came to Telegram. Back then. Are you waiting to buy back in day before launch?

Um, I am not. I think my money would be better used right now for everything we have coming up. And that's not to put it in a negative way, we just, uh, that way that's another $1011k.

I have there, uh, well, now, actually. It's probably a lot less now. Let's see.

To use. I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
It's still like, yeah, definitely less.

[Speaker 1]
All right, um, I think that is everything. Again, um, I will keep you updated. Those are the time, you know, that's the time estimate we have from everybody.

We should be well in that, is what we're told, but stuff comes up, I will keep you all updated. Yeah, we don't, you know, we're not like, waiting, but everything that has come up is, really not within our control or, yeah. That's all I'll say about that.

I feel like the more I say, the more I'm getting myself into. Do you ever wish you never got involved in this project? Um, I did, I think, definitely back, wow, it's been probably close to a year now, once a lot of the, once a lot of the wrongdoing came to light.

Um, but recently, or even remotely recently, no, sincerely. I think, um, I think like all of you or most holders, I do believe the project has great potential. It's very unfortunate what we were dealt.

I think everybody on the team is very, very disappointed by that. And, well, we just got to move forward. We could be dead.

Um, so that's also something I remember. Um, but, and I know people aren't as excited now, because we don't have, you know, a guy eating hot dog, hot dogs, or, you know, hyping up people on a voice chat, or somebody pumping and dumping the charts. I remember that would just like happen overnight, like we'd go to bed, wake up the next morning, and the charts would be dumped on, or vice versa.

Um, so yeah, I think there's a lot of differences there, a lot of wrongdoing, doing that was happening, that made us all, including people on the team, like Finman, like me, like B&B, think that everything was going, you know, great, when it really wasn't. So I think, uh, yeah, sometimes things aren't what they seem, and I feel like even though there seems to be a lot less excitement now, I think we're in a lot better place. When did you sign your NDA?

Um, that's a long time ago.

[Speaker 2]
Gosh, definitely more than a year ago. Um, okay, great.

[Speaker 3]
Let's just start back.

[Speaker 1]
Let's ask for another time estimate. I feel like you guys are constantly asking. I just got a message, so I had to ask for a time estimate again.

Um, speaking about the wrongdoing, what's the update on missing funds? I do not have an update on missing funds.

[Speaker 2]
What's the motivation for asking about turnaround possibly be? Huh? I'm not sure what you're asking.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so it looks like we're still on track as recent as right now, so that's good. Well, that's very good news. Because we did have a...

I was a little worried earlier today. Back on track as of right now. No, it never got changed.

I was just worried with the updates.

[Speaker 2]
What's your estimated token price?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, like I said before, this isn't, you know, this isn't something that's gonna be an overnight. I think this is just what we need to move forward and a lot of what you all have been asking for. Don't comment on price.

That's a joke. I'm not allowed to. Overnight oats?

Are people still eating oats? I didn't realize that. No, genuinely, it's...

oh, yeah, well, I think that's... that's probably why I'm not allowed to answer that. Wild guess.

Having this like, uh, zivia with heavy cream. I started drinking a margarita for every voice, but then I was having two voices a week, and then I felt like an alcoholic because it's like, oh, I'm drinking two nights a week? It's like I'm switching it up with the teas and the sodas.

Is Eric Finman the world's youngest... Eric Finman's a very nice guy. Very nice guy who did actually so much for us.

No, he is not the secret crypto strategic advisor. It is not Eric Finman. No.

No, no, no, he's not coming back. He was not fired. He decided to leave.

And that's the god honest truth. I'd take him back. J-Rock, why are you talking like you're talking about one of your exes?

Oh, he looks so cute. How old is he, man? Like, 12?

16, maybe? I don't know. I don't know if he had a baby face when he was a teenager.

Eric can be mean, gosh. I guess I've seen the stuff you've said about me, too. Yeah, so...

Yeah, I think this will be everything we need. You guys being sarcastic? Who's being mean?

To Eric Finman, not to me. Jan really does not like him. Universal Fun.

Posting that photo of him. Yeah. Come on.

[Speaker 2]
You guys are so mean.

[Speaker 1]
You cute kid. You little baby. I think he's probably still in his 20s, maybe.

All right, guys. Okay, so I will update you if everything is complete before Friday. We will have a voice before Friday.

I'll update you guys. I'll keep you updated. And again, please expect the changes in the chat rooms moving forward.

I'm excited to finally be able to talk to you guys. Get going. I'm really, really hoping on this week.

But yeah, I'll definitely keep you updated. You all have a great night.
