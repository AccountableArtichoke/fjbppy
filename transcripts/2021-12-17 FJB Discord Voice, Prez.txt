What's going on? What's up? What's up?

How we doing? Drew just sent me a... What's up everybody?

How we doing? How's everybody holding up today? How we feeling?

We got three notifications in general chat. What do we got? What do we got?

What are we seeing? I know I sound better. I feel fucking great.

Oh, see, there's a curse right there. That's a curse word. They got me.

I apologize. I don't even know what I'm at right now. What am I at?

110 maybe? 120? I think 120,000 probably.

150? I think it's 120,000. I think it's 120,000.

How we doing? I wanted to get on here earlier. I know that I'm sounding healthy.

We got Guinness Donnie. We've seen all iterations of Donnie. We've seen a bunch of different Donnies.

Fscomo, you guys usually see him in the early morning crew. He's an Australian beast. He's an animal.

I love the guy. He says, can you make the announcement about our 1v1 Mexico MMA match when FJB hits a dollar? That's what Fscomo wants.

Fscomo is going to get it. He's going to get a MMA match in Mexico. We'll do a pay-per-view.

Me versus Fscomo. We'll do a tag team. Me and Fscomo on the same team versus Donnie and Drew Solo.

It'll be a 2v2. We'll do a 2v2 match and it'll be fantastic. So I got you here a little bit earlier tonight.

I got you here. Keep an eye out. Yeah, keep an eye out for the Silly People, the new Silly Police.

I like the Silly Police. Maybe even DS Nuts will be there in attendance. He'll be doing the commentator.

He'll be the Joe Rogan of the MMA match. We got a 2v2 steel cage death match. Don't worry about it.

We'll be good. How we doing? How we doing, everybody?

How's our Friday going on? We're getting ready for the weekend. I actually haven't even checked the price.

I have not even checked the price. But after last night's speech about everything, about the change of ownership, the change in basically what's going on, I'm still here. People are like, oh, we're going to miss you.

I'm here more than ever. I'm still working my ass off for you guys. I've been, what is it?

It's 12-17. It's been, what, 15 days? I'm still here more than ever.

I'm not leaving. You can't get rid of me. I love this thing too much, and I love you guys too much, and I love this community too much.

Day 56. It's day 56. It's my lucky number.

And I was talking to the other people. I was saying, you know what? We haven't donated in a long time because we've been trying to figure out everything.

We've been putting all of our eggs in this basket. We haven't donated in a while. Like, can we do something?

They said, absolutely. Let's do this thing. I said, 100%.

Let's get this thing done. So what did we do today? Semper Fi has a match your donation.

So whatever you donate, they match. It's day 56 of the project. 56 is my lucky number.

And look at the time right now, 5.56 PM. That's a sign from God right there. What did we do?

We donated $5,600 to Semper Fi. Semper Fi right there, they double the donation. So that's $11,200 that was donated to Semper Fi at 5.56 PM on day 56 of this project. That's exactly what we do. I'd even line that up. And that's absolutely perfect.

Absolutely perfect. I love that so much. That's awesome.

That's huge. That's a big boom moment. Let's show that everywhere.

Let's get everybody going. We got graphics being made right now. Thank you, Ryan, for the amazing work.

You got the purple name up there. I miss talking to you, Ryan. I haven't talked to you in a little bit.

Maybe we'll connect. We'll get some things going. But exactly, exactly.

$5,600 to Semper Fi, which doubles to $11,200. $11,200 to Semper Fi. Unbelievable charity.

If you guys haven't seen it, if you guys haven't listened to it, if you guys haven't heard of it, Semper Fi is tremendous for all the work they do. I'll even throw up what they do. See, look, if people don't believe me, look, I'll take another screenshot.

This is what the whole page looks like if you don't believe me. I'm still on the page. Look at this.

You can see everything. I'll even put the timestamp in there. Look at this.

Look at this. Look at this. I'll screenshot my computer so you phonies don't think that I'm being a phony because we are 1,000% legitimate.

Look at this. I just posted that again. Look, that's another screenshot from the Let's Go Brandon Coin LLC.

Semper Fi and America's Fund, blah, blah, blah. $1,217. PayMyPayPal, $5,600.

Converts to $11,200. That's unbelievable. Unbelievable.

So excited. Couldn't be more excited about this coin. Couldn't be more excited at all about this whole thing.

See, there's the donation. See, people are posting it. Unreal.

Unreal. I think it's on slow mode. How do we turn the slow mode off?

Let's turn the slow mode off over here. I don't know how to do it. But you are immune.

Amazing. I don't want to be immune. I want to turn the slow mode off.

I want more messages. I don't know how to do it. Whatever.

But we're here. Drew, what do you think of the donations? Dude, you're kicking ass, man.

That's so awesome. What a great thing to do. Day 56 of the project, we're donating 5.6K, and it turns out that Semper Fi is doing the double. So the double's perfect. $11,200. They matched it.

That's going to do a lot of good. I cannot wait.

[Speaker 2]
Unbelievable.

[Speaker 1]
I can't wait until they call me. I can't wait till they hit me up. I've been getting things, emails, phone calls from these charities.

They're saying that we're doing life-changing work, and I can't hear. See, look, we're back. We're back.

Chicago Jacobs, we are back. That's why the name of this is Guess Who Is Back, because we're all back. We're up here feeling fantastic.

We're going to get this momentum going into the weekend. We are perfectly, if you have seen the chart, we're perfectly at support levels. Drew, fingers crossed, no Saturday sell-offs, no Saturday sillies.

Those are going to be called Saturday sillies from now on.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, man.

[Speaker 1]
I had great Saturday memes ready to send to you, too. Oh, really? So hopefully no Saturday sillies.

We're working our ass off.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, hopefully you don't have to see them.

[Speaker 1]
Let's show ... I want everybody to know what we donated today, and everybody ... So now we've donated what entirely?

$55,600, give or take. We even donated $500 to Alzheimer's. We donated $500 to eating disorders.

We donated $500 to a couple of different things. So all in all, we've probably almost donated $58,000. Unreal.

That's more than $1,000 per day. Who else is doing that? Nobody.

Exactly. That's more than $1,000 per day. That's fantastic.

Fantastic. And we're going to keep that thing going. We're going to keep that.

That's the clock that we got to fight against. We got to race against. And for the people that don't believe me, look, I'll even post ...

I got this notification. I'll send ... This is from my phone, because I get a notification to PayPal.

And I've donated a bunch to our holders, too, thank you. See, look at the picture I just posted. You sent $5,600.

If anybody doesn't believe me, oh, look at that. Look at that. We did make an $11.2,000 donation because it got doubled. That's a beautiful, beautiful graphic of that. This project is awesome. I hope you guys are excited.

There's no way you can't be excited. It's hard not to be when we're in this thing. When we're in this thing every single day working our butt off for this coin, and you guys work probably harder than me.

Unreal. Unreal. We raise this.

We absolutely ... This is not a donation from us. This is a donation from all of us.

This is a community. We raise this. We work hard.

We do things. We get things done. I know there's a lot of people that have questioned us in the past, but I can't think of a time ever where we haven't come through on something, whether it was liquidity not being locked, or version one to version two, or version two to version three, or saying that we were going to get things done and make things, or donate X amount of dollars.

All of those things have been hit. All of those things have been done. All of those things have been done.

That's what I'm saying. That's exactly what I'm saying. Freak beast.

I'm sounding good. Sounding real good. Thank you.

That means a lot. What do we got? I have to donate 120,000 coins, right?

I said that. This is my swear jar. We'll keep it going.

We'll keep it going. 130 now? I think you guys are messing with me, but whatever.

130. We're at 130 right now. It's the running clock.

It's the running clock, all right? Let's make it 150. Fuck, fuck.

That's 150. Now I'm at 150. I have 150,000 coins that I'm going to donate.

Now we're here. We're all set. We're all good.

It's going to be a great Friday night. I'm not stopping this thing. I haven't done an eating thing in a while.

I think you guys deserve one. That'll come soon. I haven't thought of it.

I'm trying to lose a couple pounds. You guys are making me put on the weight. I don't want to put on the weight.

We also have two new Project Veritas people in here. I don't know their usernames yet, but Turok, thank you so much for getting them in here. Drew, Solo, and other moderators are going to work on getting them a new designation because Ryan has his purple designation.

We have the meme team with theirs. We have the moderators with theirs. We all got different colors.

I got my blue color. Do I like the blue color? I don't know, but I got the blue color.

Maybe we'll even get Fskomo his own color. We'll get him as my tag team partner color. We'll get everybody their own colors over here.

Everybody, have a great night. Enjoy your weekend. I'm going to be talking to you.

Don't worry. I'm always here. Have a great night.

Be safe. Don't drink too much. Chill.

Let's chill. Let's chill. Once I get the official graphic of it, we're going to post that everywhere.

I want everybody to see that. Let's take the StockTwits. Let's take the Twitter.

Let's take the Instagram. Take the TikTok. Let's chill.

Let's chill. Let's chill. I know that we always say chill, but let's keep doing it.

Have a good one. Have a good weekend. Things are going to be great.

Don't worry about it. We always come through. Have a good one.
