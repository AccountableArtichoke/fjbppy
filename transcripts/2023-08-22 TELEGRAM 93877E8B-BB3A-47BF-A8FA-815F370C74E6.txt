[Speaker 1]
Happy Tuesday. Can you all hear me? I assume you can because Nolan said something about the music.

I hope you are all having a wonderful week so far. I'm ecstatic because it's been a little bit cooler here but not super humid, but I'll take that. So I have good news, bad news, um, I mean not necessarily bad news, but I just don't have a timeline for you guys yet.

I was waiting on, so I had the meeting yesterday with one of the third parties to lock in the time frame if they're still good with that and that would, that determines if we'd go live before the end of the month in August. We were supposed to have a second meeting today and the guy I had the meeting with, his colleague, informed me late this morning that he's actually out because he does not feel well. He did say he will be in tomorrow, which our time is later tonight, so hoping he's back in the and we get that answer from him and I'll keep you updated.

So that's majorly what we're depending on right now. Again, I'll let you know as soon as we get the updates. Yeah, I know, hopefully it's not a, hopefully it's not a COVID thing.

I hope it's not this new COVID thing where everybody's start being out of the office again. Send them all some ivermectin and stay up. I know I just ordered some more of that, so okay.

Everything else is going as expected. Everything else is going well. I've had to actually get ready all these past few days due to meetings, so it's been actually very exciting, even though I obviously know everything going on is just getting a little bit more real, having the final meetings with everybody, but I will keep you updated.

I haven't gotten any messages and DMs. Transact, we're still on the last list of emails that we sent over that last batch. We are still waiting on them if your account has been disabled. They do, you know, use their own metrics to decide when they disable account.

A lot of times it's after you all just make large purchases or a few of them, but we are able to pretty much get any account back unless it is flagged by your bank, so sometimes the first or six digits actually of your account number or last six digits, excuse me, will be marked by your bank, so that's when you have to call your bank, but I've usually let you all know who've had that problem to go ahead and contact your bank.

Otherwise, we should be able to get your account back as long as we get the info they need. They just want to make sure you're not a scammer, so we should be fine there. We're determining of what is a scammer in their system.

We are working on that so that we don't have this grow into a bigger issue as our volume grows, so they're definitely willing to work with us. We just want to find something that works for everybody, and obviously we don't want them to lose money. We don't want to lose money.

We can go ahead and whitelist any account, but the thing is we'd have to pay those chargebacks if that account did turn out to be a scammer, so I will keep you updated on that. We're very grateful for Transac and them being able to work with us. They've been super, super awesome.

Okay, let's see. All testing by team completed? No, because we'll still have as much as can be completed right now is we're waiting on some things from third party.

That'll be final, final testing for some things that we're still waiting on. Are you negotiating SLAs with the vendors? I will keep you updated on that as soon as I have more information.

What were you expecting to hear from today's meeting? So, that was just the sorry, I'm trying to read. That was the third party letting us know if the time frame they gave us before still works for them for us to go live.

We are majorly depending on that, and that at this point is determining whether we'll be live by the end of the month or not. As far as everything we can do, we are good. And everything that our dev can do, he's also been amazing, so that's great news.

And as far as getting everything to function, um, everything is great. Super amazing. Feels great to finally get everything working as it should.

Don't forget to... Thank you, Nolan. I will, uh, forward that.

When Dev doxxed, he said he's willing to, uh, come on call. He's, he's, uh, he enjoys reading you all's messages, even the crazy ones. I think most of those are on Discord, but sometimes I'm here.

I think it keeps him entertained. Do they need more information from the meeting the day prior? No, not at all.

The third party has everything they need. They are very, very familiar with us. This is not a matter of, yeah, no.

They just, um, had something on their end and, you know, all the other businesses they deal with. How much capital is known to be sitting on the sidelines from investors that have a relationship SKB waiting on it for task completion? I have no clue.

You guys, uh, I expected you all to have that info. Probably get it on the find out more on getter or forward. But I think, um, yeah, I'm very, I'm very excited.

Again, this is nothing. Everything in the task is everything you've all asked for over and over again. So I think it'll be absolutely amazing.

Plus every little detail carefully thought out by the team. I think it'll be great. How many advisors and team members are there right now?

Oh gosh, let's start from the top. One, two, this is including Bannon and Steve. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

10, 11, 12. About a dozen people including, including me. Okay, uh, let's see.

Also had a meeting with Vess. That was amazing. Uh, how many advisors and team members will there be after task is completed?

Uh, probably the same. That includes the advisor that we just brought on. We will, we do have some, some more people.

Um, yeah, I'll, I'll, we'll, I'll give you guys more details as things are finalized. Don't want to jump the gun, but we'll keep you updated with every detail. Very excited for that.

Can Vess implement a recovery technique where you only need your seed words? Uh, so we actually are in, yeah, we're, we're in talks with Vess to make, to make everything a little bit more simple, uh, as far as Vess goes, but also to keep that security. Um, they, they're looking forward to that.

It's just, um, and, and we'll definitely have educational, uh, material on Vess specifically too. I think, uh, if users understand exactly why Vess is, um, I shouldn't try to read at the same time. Um, I think if everybody knows exactly why Vess works the way it does and, uh, the level of security it adds to your account, um, I think it, everybody would be a little bit more willing to use that.

Oh, goodness. All right. Who is developing the educational materials?

The team is, and, uh, that every, depending on what the material is, example, the, uh, videos and material, including Vess, they're actually helping with that. So super cool. Don't make us go to Discord.

I feel like we should just have the, uh, live announcement in like one of the side chats. Since the Discord people keep saying don't do it in Telegram, and Telegram keeps saying don't do it in Discord. I think Getter only has video lives.

Otherwise, we do it on there. Uh, is the team concerned with the performance of B&B and the current price? Uh, no, not at all.

I think that's, uh, I think they're all... I don't care. Ed doesn't care where it's done.

Reveal a secret task in a secret chat group. Yep, I think that's it. Don't email me about that.

Just kidding. That would be cool to hear it from, straight from Steve, huh? All right, um, I think that's everything.

Please get your coins off XT. If you do still have coins on there, if you can't do it directly on XT, just go ahead and contact their customer service. And if their support is unable to help you, please DM me.

Or if you want, you can just DM me if it's not letting you do it on there. Just include your account information. I can go ahead and take care of you there.

But please make sure to get your coins off there sooner than later. Is TPUSA confirmed? We are not.

We do have, um, another meeting with them after TASC is live. Very excited about that. Hoping something definitely comes out of that.

We should be able to do, um, with obviously Steve's connection, uh, along with our personal connection, my personal connection. We're hoping to make that happen. When's the return of Eric Finman?

Is a War Room launch still possible in September? Uh, so that's going to depend completely on Steve and Boris. But you know, we were told as soon as we have our stuff together, um, that we'd get back on there.

We obviously want the app functioning. Um, Dev has been, uh, reviewing the code and the app since we have, since the team's now testing, he's completed testing. Uh, he's just, uh, reviewing everything.

The code, as far as the code in the app. So getting familiar with it all. Uh, so if meeting goes ahead tomorrow and they give the nod, what will that mean for TASC reveal?

Uh, we should still be able to go live before, uh, September. If that's the case. If they are still able to do everything on their end in the timeframe.

So we're completely, uh, depending on that. Uh, sounds like no fund recovery from grant, et cetera. Uh, so regarding, at least not a priority.

Um, okay. So regarding our missing funds, the issue with that is, let me see. The issue with that is we have, uh, Steve and we have Boris.

So if they're going to get the feds to go after our missing funds or whoever was involved in that, the feds are likely going to go after who? Um, so we still have time, uh, but that is turned into more of a civil case of, uh, and that's not Steve or Boris going after the missing funds. Um, that's where we're at right now with that.

Um, yeah, I will, uh, update you. Well, when I do have an update. Um, then this is, this is information straight from our attorney.

So, can you tell us is TASC reveal the same meaning as going live? Yes and no. Um, because TASC reveal, we are, the TASC is going live.

Um, however, that's not us going live on War Room. Completely different. Uh, to go live on War Room and start attending, um, events.

That will be after our app is 100% functional. Um, so clarifying that. Good question, just because I've seen it get asked plenty of times.

Um, let me know if I need to clarify that. Who does R refer to? R, attorney, meaning, uh, Boris's attorney, meaning Steve's attorney, and, uh, meaning FJB, Patriot Pays attorney.

So, uh, a few of them. Aw, that, that picture looks older than Finn looks now. Sounds like we need a holder to file a civil, civil lawsuit.

Um, well, that's exactly what's happening. Uh, so I will, I will update you on that. Does that mean OG holders could come, organize, and go?

Sorry, I'm not reading that correctly. I don't think, we're not understanding that at least. Going live means the TASC reveal and whatever changes that involves has been completed.

Yes. Uh, that's revealing the TASC and having the TASC go live. Marketing and pushing on War Room means we are live and the app is 100.

Absolutely correct, yes. I think we're just, uh, I think some were just, uh, confusing, and I, I may have presented it as far as I think we're using live as the word, so a lot of could get very confusing there. But yes, when TASC is a lot, when TASC is announced, we're also going live.

The TASC is going live. We just don't want to start marketing or War Room if people still can't, uh, get on the app to get the app working with the bugs on there. I mean, I'd like to because I like dogs, but I don't know.

I feel, I feel like I do have some trauma there and probably everybody else does too. But hoping that our main guy from the third party is feeling better and back in the office, uh, tonight, our time. Where is Jan?

I haven't seen him. I haven't seen a lot of faces. I saw Johnny come back in.

That's nice. Okay. We're also waiting on TASC to go live for, uh, the official trademark and LLC.

We had to wait for that for some, for a specific reason, so that will all be official at once. 50-50 chance, live before this Friday, live. I honestly have no clue because right now we're, uh, completely depending on, we can't go live with, uh, I hate timelines.

I've hated timelines for a very long time, like a year and a half now. I was the one person saying, please don't give a time, please don't give a time. And the boys always wanted to put a time on it.

Um, but yeah, it's completely, uh, dependent on that. After this third party, are we waiting on another third party? No.

This is our main, the main one we're waiting for. Everybody else, uh, is good right now. After this TASC, is there another TASC?

Uh, I don't think, I don't see anything in the near future that we can't flat out tell you we're working on. So while there is other TASCs, which is, uh, like the roadmap, white paper, um, getting the app, adding different functions to the app, should be super exciting, uh, events, war room, all things. I'm so excited to not have to, uh, deal with that any longer.

Did the tweaks get fixed? Uh, we are, no, we are waiting, we have, we're waiting on the, we're waiting on a third party. Is the third party just needing to switch addresses around?

No, they, uh, have their engineering team working on something. They just have a ton of clients. Uh, so we just want to confirm they'll still do it in the timeline they promised.

They cannot do it in that timeline. I will update you all as soon as I find out, but I'm really praying that they still can. Um, not a hundred percent depending on it.

Uh, just because that's the way it works, but, uh, we still have time. Without risk of providing financial advice, is your view, is there a ceiling to this project? Can you post my Bitcoin wallet address on the website and say NABTC or something else?

Hey, we have, we have tips and discord. Start, start airdropping in there again. I think I've only been airdropping like once a week or so.

Not, I don't think I have this week, actually. Okay. Any additional interactions with federal regulators?

God, no. Well, uh, I think that's every, let's see, what time is it in? The rest of the world is just waking up, so hoping I could hear something tonight.

Uh, if I do, I'll update you guys in here. Other than that, again, please don't accidentally sell your coins or swap or transfer them in the app. Uh, as you know, we still have bugs on there.

Um, can't return those, uh, the 8% tax if you do, do that. I'm really sorry. Wish we could, but then we'd have to do it for everybody.

Um, let me know if you all need any help DM me or tag me. Um, yeah, I think that's all. Don't send us any money or share your seed phrase.

I think, uh, you all have been great about that. Um, which geographical area is the third party in? So all the third parties we deal with and the dev are in India, China, and Canada.

I think that's, uh, oh, and Lebanon. So I guess quite a few places everywhere, everywhere around the world. Is the merch store still a thing?

Yes, it is. Actually, there's, there's still some of you still ordering off there. And, uh, very recently, not FJB stuff per se, but other, some other pieces of the merch.

Um, we are, uh, upgrading that too with the Patriot Pay. Um, not exactly the first priority, but I think it'll all be super cool because that'll help us get into some of the events here, some of the non-political events. Will the gift cards start getting rolled out after task?

Yes. They are beautiful. Uh, we are, I was actually working on that today, we are rebranding the gift cards to, obviously.

Be nice. Oh, yay, somebody collected their drops. I don't know who those users are, but Scooter, which one of you is Scooter?

Scooter and Telegram too? Lost count of all your name changes. Okay, I think that's everything.

Um, I do appreciate your patience, by the way. It's nice not to have all the added stress. I do still get the, uh, occasional screenshots from side chats and stuff, but those, you know, I don't need to reply to those or anything like that.

Sometimes entertaining. But I do, uh, appreciate not having that stress in the, uh, general chat rooms. Helps, helps the day go a little bit quicker with everything going on right now.

Um, but I do sincerely mean that and, um, I know I see the jokes about that and people taking shots with every time I say that, but, um, I really, I really do mean that. Uh, I do appreciate that and it does impact my day. Not that I don't choose to be in the position I'm in, but it's, uh, sometimes if it's the worst day and I get that added on top of it, it's definitely a stressor.

So I appreciate that. Um, again, I really do think you all will be quite impressed with every function. Um, I do hate that I've had to keep this under wraps, um, but it was not my decision and, uh, I think it'll be well worth it along with every detail, um, on every function.

Super, super cool. And I think everything, uh, will make sense on why everything took so long and all the loopholes we had to jump through, um, to get absolutely everything we wanted. So uh, I think it'll be well worth it.

Um, yeah, I think, I think you all will really be really, really excited once, once we are finally there. Um, but I will keep you updated once I hear from the third party, hoping to hear from him tonight. But every other meeting I've had with him has been my time mornings, um, at 8am.

So hoping he jumps on tonight. I know his meetings go, are scheduled throughout our night. So, uh, if I need to schedule it, you know, in the middle of the night, that's totally fine.

We've done that too. Uh, but I'll keep you updated. Hopefully we can get it, uh, still live before the end of August.

But if we can't and, you know, and they're too busy to have it completed by then, then, um, that's, that's what we gotta do. Um, I will keep you updated either way. Uh, I am hopeful, but if that's what we have to deal with, then we have no other choice.

I'm glad everything, pretty much everything on our end is, uh, complete. Basically just waiting, uh, we can't really do much else now. Uh, you all have a great night.

I will get this recording up, uh, with a few notes for Sam. I know Sam doesn't like listening to the chats. That's like me watching YouTube videos.

I don't like watching that because I could just read a lot quicker than the video goes. So I'll do that right now. You all have a great week.

Tag me or DM me if you need anything else. Thank you.
