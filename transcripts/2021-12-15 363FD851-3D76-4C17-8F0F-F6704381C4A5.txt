We've got the copy. Oh, oh, oh. They try to sneak it on us.

They try to sneak us on us. They try to sneak it. Who would try to sneak it on us?

What we're going to do is this. I'm going to send it in the announcements. It's Wednesday, my dudes.

Okay. I can't believe I thought it was Thursday. I thought it was Thursday this whole day.

I really did. So what we're going to do is this. To start it out tonight.

I'm sorry if I'm a little bit. I'm down tonight. I'm not feeling the greatest, but I'm not feeling too bad.

I got my ice cream cone. Don't worry. I already have my ice cream cone.

So add everybody. We're doing. So today is the 15th.

We're going to run this thing until. I'm thinking of the best time that we can do this. I'm going to say 12 PM Eastern.

So noon Eastern.

[Speaker 2]
Christmas Eve. Noon.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just going to type it out. I'll say it too. So non-archist made an NFT about me.

And it's hilarious. It cracks me up. He sent it over to me tonight.

And he was like, you should do a donation with this. So first of all, non-archist, you're a beast. I need to eat a damn Frank.

You're right. Non-archist. You're an animal.

Thank you. Shout out for the great idea. He made an NFT.

I'll send it in here. This is it right here. I'll start.

So take a look right there. He made an NFT. What I'm going to do is this.

There's going to be a bidding war, I guess, on this or whatever. An auction on this. An auction.

He made that one and an FJB one. So you have the two ones. Not Weg.

I'm not not Weg. We're going to do a bidding war on that one. And by Christmas Eve.

So November 20. Not November 24th. Jeez Louise.

I'm all over the place tonight. December 24th. 12 p.m. Eastern. Whatever that is. I'm going to donate all of that to St. Jude's for Christmas. So whatever that those profits are, those proceeds, that's going to go right to St. Jude's. And it's going to be a whole thing in terms of, hey, let's get this. Let's get that bidding war up, whatever it may be. And we're going to donate that thing right to St. Jude's. So it's going to be awesome. I'm excited. Great cause.

Great people. I'm winning that NFT to CPA. So I'm sending it in here.

Send in the announcements. Bidding contest for this NFT by at Nonarchist.

[Speaker 2]
So I'm sending in the link. I think in the link.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. Maybe we'll get Nonarchist to explain it. I think I just go on here and I click sell item.

Oh, yeah, yeah. So I do that. I go sell item and then I do an on auction and then I say start time and then end time.

So the start time I'm going to open it up and the end time is going to be the 24th at 12 p.m. Cool.

[Speaker 2]
12 p.m. 01 BNB.

[Speaker 1]
I wish I could put it as FJB. That'd be fucking sick. But now BNB.

And then I agree and continue. An auction date must be greater than the.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. No shit. What do they want from me?

Maybe they want it to be the 23rd.

[Speaker 1]
And continue. What are they talking about? Auction and date must be greater than the auction start date and can only last up to seven days.

That's the stupidest shit I've ever heard. That's the stupidest shit I've ever heard. No, I would just curse twice.

Okay. So it's ending the 22nd. It's now it's ending the 22nd.

Confirm. It's. We listed it.

So let me see if we have to. I think I have to approve the transaction. We've met a mask because not our kiss.

Not our kiss. Gave it to me. Confirmed.

Let's list this bad boy. Know what I'm at. And I think I'm at 80,000 in terms of my donation for my curse for my swear jar.

We're listing. It's listing.

[Speaker 2]
I'm confirming. Yeah, I'm confirming. Don't worry about it.

[Speaker 1]
Account to confirm. Come on Metta. Give me the confirmation.

Don't do it twice. Does he mean we do it three times? What if I'm signing away my life right over here?

What if not our kiss really scammed me?

[Speaker 2]
No, he wouldn't do that. Like not our kiss. He's a good guy.

Do you try to swindle me? How does this thing doing it? Uh.

Yeah, I know. He's a good dude.

[Speaker 1]
I know he's good. It's 90k in the curse jar. Oh, awesome.

It's it's successfully successfully auctioned. Oh, it starts in seven minutes. That's huge.

That's sick. Cool. Okay, so I'm copying this.

I think this is the thing. Corn pop is a good dude. No, corn pops a good dude.

Not a bad dude. He's a good dude. Corn pops a bad dude.

[Speaker 2]
So I'm gonna say bidding contest for this NFT. All right. I placed it that there.

There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Up until 12-22-2021. 12 p.m. Eastern. I will donate all proceeds to dudes.

[Speaker 2]
Christmas. There you go. There we go.

Now we're talking.

[Speaker 1]
It's starting in seven minutes. If anybody wants some stupid pixelated picture of me from like two years ago. Why not?

I don't. I don't own any NFTs. I don't think I'll ever own an NFT.

But we got this one. Thanks to thanks to Nonarchist. So clap it up for Nonarchist for doing this.

Bringing us together. Hopefully we get a nice donation going. I'm excited.

We'll do this right here. One, two, three. JB.

Nonarchist. The first donation of the night right there. I told you I'll be doing a Millie giveaway every single night.

That's another Millie right there. Nonarchist. Congratulations.

That's a Millie. You're a beast. Thank you so much for everything you've done.

You're most welcome. You can connect your wallet and bid. Yes.

So according to Nonarchist, you just basically connect your wallet and you bid on it and then you're all set. I want that Pirate Tendy Taker. I want that Pirate Tendy Taker.

That's a good one. That's a good one. All right.

So what else is going on? How are we doing, everybody? So that's out of the way.

We got that contest going. Very exciting. Hopefully we get some good bids on it.

And that finishes up on the 22nd. So I thought it was going to be the Christmas Eve, but I guess we can't do that. I'll do the donation on Christmas Eve because I like that.

I like that idea. Donation will be on Christmas Eve, but the contest is going to run to the 22nd. And hopefully it's a big donation to St. Jude's. That'd be freaking awesome. We can do it. We're also doing something else as a Christmas donation too.

So don't worry. We're also doing something else for a Christmas donation. But St. Jude's, I would love to do that with this contest. Great idea. Absolutely great idea. What else is going on?

I'm going to keep it short tonight because I think my voice is going to start to go. But people are saying big news. Hey, don't tag me and say big news.

The news has been worked on like a monkey smoking crack. We've been doing this thing 24-7. We haven't stopped.

And that's not the great news, Stefano. It's not the great news. That's the shit and chill.

That is hilarious. That is the greatest thing I've ever seen right there. I hope that I go into a bathroom one day and I see that.

FJB Diamond Hand, you just got yourself $250,000, FJB, for that. Because you are Diamond Hand according to your name. And did I curse again?

I can't believe I just cursed again. I'm at $100,000. What am I doing?

All right. I'm at $100,000 on the curse jar. That's all right.

That's all right. It happens. It happens.

But that's an awesome shill. That's a great job right there. I also thought of another great idea and something fun that we can do tonight.

So I have the $500,000, FJB, left. So I did the $250,000, $250,000. And you have to censor me.

No, on my Fox News appearance, I'm going to go up there and I'm just going to drop the F-bomb a couple of times. They're going to give me, he made you say, oh, you got me. See, you got me.

But I have a great idea right here. And I think that some people in here would definitely enjoy it in terms of the shilling competition. And I think it could also be tremendous in terms of something different.

I think somebody mentioned it to me. I'm going to throw this in the announcements.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to say, at everyone who shill contest tonight, $500,000 with someone that, and I don't know how we'd be able to prove that. But okay. $500,000 left.

So I'm going to say $250,000 to two people shill on this site. Announcements right there.

[Speaker 1]
If you get on Omegle tonight, that I just posted in the announcements, you get on there, you get some people to, Omegle, Donald Pump, absolutely. You get some people on there to, that's, I think it's a good idea. You get on there, you start chit-chatting about FJB.

You start saying about the Let's Go Brandon. Maybe we'll get a couple new holders. Maybe we'll get another couple new people.

Because I think we can get some people on there, on Omegle. That might be better than Donnie. I think a little, maybe, I like it.

I like it. I like it. A little Omegle type of action.

Scott Stocks, I can see you on Omegle shaking your little booty. I can see it. I'm not trying to see random dogs.

Yeah, I don't know. Two months to the auction. So, no, that'd be fine.

It's the obvious elephant in the room. And I wish I could come up here and give you that answer. It's not up to me.

It hasn't been up to me. It's why it's been this long. If it was up to me, it would be three weeks ago that we said it.

There's a lot of compliance that has been going on. And it's just, we're trying to work this through and trying to get everything squared away. And it's like, we feel like we go two steps forward, one step back, two steps forward, one step back, two steps forward, one step back.

And it's so, so, so, so hard. But we're so close. And we're, like, reaching at the door.

And I want you guys to know so bad. And I just want it to be announced more. More than, I think, I want it to be announced more than you guys.

Because I'm the one that has to go up here every single night and talk to you guys about everything. You know what I mean? I mean, I'm the one that has to go up here and say, hey, this is what we're doing.

This is what's going on every single night. So, it's so hard. Let's see what Omegle is saying.

So, yeah, exactly. Omegle. Qcoin update.

Qcoin, we're still working on them. I can see if I can pull up in the telegram. They said they're going to let me know by the end of the week is the last thing that they say.

It's my guy, Mai Ling Wang. Mai Ling Wang said he'll let me know by the end of the week. They have, like, now their legal team is looking over it.

They basically, like, we have to input everything that we have, all the information on ourselves. They gave us the first pass-through. Then now the second pass-through is, like, we get into, like, an email correspondence.

And we had to do that. We got all of the legal correspondence set. And then now their legal team is checking over our application.

It's the legal team, legal team, legal team. Oh, there's $110,000. It's just annoying.

But that's $110,000 right there. Up with that. So, there you go.

Happyface21. I don't want to hear your negativity. It's December 15th.

It's December. Nobody ever said mid-January. I'm up here giving away a milli every single night until I get some solid ground on it.

Because that's what I'm doing. I committed to that. I made my bed.

I'm sleeping in it. I'm handing out these millis every single night. SunDevil28.

She texted me that before, too. She was asking about the Rona. And she told me to not be a baby back BIT.

I'm not saying it because I'm not adding to the curse jar. Not adding to the curse jar. But you guys send screenshots.

Send screenshots. And you'll see $250,000. $250,000.

Not dollar. Not dollar. $250,000 coin donation on Omegle.

Let's get on Omegle. Let's shill that thang. Let's start.

Well, that auction's about to get kicked off. I think it's about to kick off. Oh, it started.

The auction started. So, if you're interested in the auction, interested in giving back, get on that thang. And you're going to be all set.

Is that Barry Trash?

[Speaker 2]
There he is.

[Speaker 1]
That's Corn Pop. Is it?

[Speaker 2]
Can you do video on Omegle? I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
If you can do Omegle.

[Speaker 2]
Chat roulette perhaps? Maybe I'll offer. Yeah, I thought Omegle was video.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Everybody's chatting on it right now. M15 Horny.

Okay, I'm... That's unreal. This is not V4.

D is nuts. This is not V4. We were told about how we should go about the Discord and everything.

So, it's also better. I was on with Discord support this morning. It's also better in terms of the cash.

Clear cash? Catch? Catchy?

Cash? Cash? Whatever it is.

However you pronounce it. But, yeah, Twan, the paintballs. You know, maybe I'll get somebody that...

Maybe I'll get one of my buddies to shoot me with some paintballs. And I'll post a video on here. Because we need to do that.

I definitely owe you guys a food competition too. That's been overdone too. Because it's been a while.

It's definitely been a while. But, yeah, all in all. We're working on that.

It's pronounced cash. Okay, it's pronounced cash. Whatever.

But, everybody, I need to eat a frank. Because I'm feeling down in the dumps now. But, Corona...

Yeah, I have like five paintball guns. You want to go together? No, I'm not in Illinois.

But, of course we are. So, we got... Keep...

I'm sorry if I'm not energetic or I'm all over the place. The Ron Jon Surf Shop is getting to me. However...

Post on Omegle. I want to see some video chats of people shilling FJB. We got 250k.

250k. It's a lot less credit than OutWeg. OutWeg.

I'm expecting some big things from you on Omegle. I'm a pump. Get on Omegle.

You know what I mean? If you got to do it for FJB, you got to do it for FJB. Start shilling.

Look at this. Check the balance right here. We got 500 big ones still.

Ready to go. Ready to get out of there. And...

Yeah, and we got that auction. So, start donating. Start bidding that thing up for the auction.

And I love you guys. And I wish I could tell you about the news tonight. But as of right now, I can't tell you.

But it's still there. It's just a matter of when you're going to hear it. We're working on that.

24-7. We have not stopped. However, I love you guys.

Shill. Get some FJB for the free. These guys sending me some Omegle stuff.

I love it. I love Omegle. Keep it going.

Alright. I love you.
