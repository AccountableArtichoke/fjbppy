(2:15 - 2:28)
Yo, what's up everybody? Got freaking 180 before I even hopped in here. Geez Louise, I always like wait a couple minutes and I just like kind of see the numbers. I know me waiting, I'm obviously like they're waiting on stuff.

(2:28 - 2:35)
What's up everybody? I'm not even asking if you can hear me because I know you can hear me. So we got the pump it up going. I was getting, I was getting juice.

(2:35 - 2:44)
Who's in the, who's here? Bill, what's up brother? Doing well, man. I'm excited. 182 people already.

(2:44 - 2:51)
Geez. Geez, geez, geez. So we got, yeah, I'm going to see, let me close this thing out over here.

(2:52 - 2:54)
Kill the bot. We're killing the bot. Bots killed.

(2:56 - 3:00)
We got it. Yeah. So you got, oh, someone already started the stage too.

(3:00 - 3:06)
Usually I started the stage or somebody started the stage and I love it. All right. What's going on everybody? We got a Thursday night.

(3:08 - 3:18)
Thursday night football Falcons are playing the Patriots. Not even going to watch it, but I think I saw the line. If anybody bets, it was like six and a half to the paths.

(3:19 - 3:26)
Uh, that's a lot of points. I'd like the Falcons to cover, but I just saw that not betting on it. I'm watching.

(3:26 - 3:29)
I got work to do. We got this thing to go. It's my two cents.

(3:30 - 3:44)
Oh, what's going on? Everybody freaking happy Thursday, October 18th. We got, uh, well, geez, almost a full month of this thing. I think it was October 22nd is our, is our birthday.

(3:44 - 3:51)
October 22nd, 2021. So we got a little one month anniversary coming in. That's pretty cute.

(3:51 - 4:08)
Day 27, a whole lot happened, um, in the past 27 days. But today, what happened today? What did we do? Uh, first and foremost, and the most important thing, uh, that $20,000 donation. We, we did a sneak attack last night and announced that we were going to donate that bad boy.

(4:09 - 4:19)
And, uh, and then we donated today to helicopters for heroes. If you guys haven't read about them, I'll actually throw it in, uh, in the chat over here. I'll throw the link.

(4:19 - 4:29)
Cause it's an unbelievable organization. Um, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. Let me put this switch channel, which channel, which channel, which channel, which channel you got the charity idea.

(4:29 - 4:34)
I'll throw the, throw the charity ideas, whatever, throw it in there. How it comes for heroes. Great fricking organization.

(4:35 - 4:51)
We got in contact with actually the president of the organization. I was like, Hey, uh, from let's go, Brandon coin, uh, FJB. We, uh, we do this thing where we donate to different charities, uh, basically raising awareness for veterans and how mistreated they are.

(4:51 - 4:56)
And, um, we just, we love our veterans. We love the great people that serve our country. They're our heroes.

(4:56 - 5:08)
And, uh, we would like to donate $20,000 to you guys. And he told me he had chills on the phone and it was just like, I had such a big smile on my face and he couldn't stop it. He was like, you could tell the excitement on the other line.

(5:08 - 5:21)
And he was like, for a small foundation and small organization, you don't realize like how much this is going to do. Like this is going directly to help people. And there's, there's big organizations out there and foundations where you donate.

(5:21 - 5:52)
Sometimes you're like, eh, I don't really know where the money's going to go. Is it going to go into somebody's pockets? Is it going to go here? Is it going to go there? Like this is going directly to veterans help for, for veterans with PTSD, uh, to help them get jobs around the Dallas area. Um, so much so that he, uh, he invited me down, um, and I would love for ever as many people in here, uh, to get down there and, um, and to, to maybe do like a, like a FJB meetup down there in February, February 25th to the 27th.

(5:52 - 5:55)
It's an awesome, it's going to be an awesome weekend. I can't wait. He invited me down.

(5:55 - 6:01)
I got a helicopter ride and it's because all you guys do it. It's awesome. You get, be going helicopters.

(6:01 - 6:06)
You shoot some wild hogs. It's the big events, big charity thing, dude. And I can't, I can't wait.

(6:06 - 6:12)
I cannot wait. Um, yeah, man, man, but you guys, you guys should go down there and, and do it. It's a fucking blast.

(6:12 - 6:18)
It's going to be a blast. I can't wait. Never been to Texas, uh, but Texas looks like a fricking place to go.

(6:18 - 6:22)
So I'm excited for that. And they're excited. And even more importantly, we're helping people out.

(6:22 - 7:16)
And that's, that's the most important piece of this. Uh, what else did we do today? I had a zoom call, um, like I mentioned before with a Newsmax. So we're trying to figure out kind of the next ad.

(7:16 - 7:33)
He just did a podcast with him, with Denise D'Souza, um, big political commentator. Uh, he did that podcast with him and got like a million views. Um, and we just, we, he's doing a piece on us tonight that that reporter tonight or tomorrow morning, he said, it's coming out most likely tonight.

(7:33 - 7:39)
So he's going to work right on it. Cause he was excited about it. Uh, so that's going to be awesome for some real publications coming out about us, some, some real coverage.

(7:39 - 7:50)
And, and basically in that world, that, that PR world you get, uh, I'll throw the, uh, I'll throw, this is the guy that, uh, that he just did a podcast with. So the guy's legit. Uh, he's got a podcast.

(7:51 - 7:59)
He's got, uh, that's not the guy who I talked to on the phone tonight, but he, this guy does a podcast. He does, he's a writer. He's a journalist, uh, covered a lot of different stories and was really intrigued about this coin.

(7:59 - 8:02)
You heard about us actually. So the word's getting out. The shilling is working.

(8:02 - 8:11)
Uh, the shilling does work tremendously. Well, and, uh, we're on the phone in the whole rundown and he's juiced about it. He's really juiced about it.

(8:11 - 8:17)
Uh, he's going to cover that paper on us. He's going to post that once I get the link to that, he said, he's going to text me. Yeah.

(8:17 - 8:24)
I got 200 people in voice. That's unbelievable, dude. I, this, this is really, I remember we used to have like 63 and I was like, that's a lot, 200 people.

(8:24 - 8:36)
That's fricking three times that. Um, yeah. And then, uh, he actually, the, so the guy that was, that was, uh, interviewing me, uh, was saying that he heard us on Tim pool's thing.

(8:36 - 8:43)
And he was like, I hear, he heard about us and I was like, geez, like we're getting our word out, man. I love that thing. Um, so I was juiced up.

(8:43 - 8:46)
I was excited. I'm excited for that piece to come out. It's going to cover us.

(8:47 - 9:08)
Um, once we get that, we'll, we'll show the nines out of that thing. We'll go, everybody and their mom's going to be reading it. Um, and then in the PR world, in the news world, uh, when people read a story, they, uh, then other news publications say, well, what the hell, why didn't we cover these guys first need to cover them? Then fricking people are going to be knocking on our door.

(9:08 - 9:16)
They're going to be saying, Hey, we need to get to these guys. We need to figure this out. Uh, wait to absolutely get this thing going.

(9:16 - 9:21)
Um, so I'm excited for that. It's going to be a snowball effect. This, this weekend is going to be jam packed with things.

(9:21 - 9:38)
It's Thursday night right now, but I know that it's like every single day so far has been like, we, I, you wake up and you're like, what's going to go on today? Like what's, what's going to happen. And, uh, I'm an early riser as you guys know, and I get everything set up for the day. I get on my, check my calendar, doing my phone calls.

(9:38 - 9:44)
And it's like, phone calls just come up. I'm like, I can't even know about the post millennial today until like 3 PM. And there's like, oh, we had a phone call at six.

(9:44 - 9:52)
And I'm like, Ooh, that's pretty awesome. Um, so that was good. We had that with the Newsmax, that with post-millennial, um, the donation was tremendous.

(9:52 - 10:10)
We, uh, just brought some NFT things, um, not actual NFTs now, but, uh, we, we got into some NFT group chats, NFT TikTok. That's an untapped resource that we haven't even cracked yet. And, and our other developer fan boy is an NFT pro like one of legitimately one of the best in the space.

(10:10 - 10:25)
Uh, so I'm very excited about that. Uh, very excited about NFTs because if you guys have been following the NFT market, it's, it's not as, uh, liquid as it, as it was the, the trading volumes is drying up a little bit. So they need something else.

(10:25 - 10:34)
And they're going to see, let's go, Brandon FJB coin. They're going to say, Whoa, that's got almost 7,000 holders. This has got a community of almost four.

(10:34 - 10:40)
They love communities in the NFT space. They love it. Um, discord sometimes like 10 to 20,000 people.

(10:40 - 10:45)
We have 4,000 people and we talk left and right. We don't stop. You can always, it always has somebody typing, which is awesome.

(10:45 - 10:53)
Um, and the, the, the discord, the discord is tremendous. It's a, it's an awesome discord. Um, and we got that going on.

(10:53 - 11:09)
So we're going to see some new faces. We'll probably pop up on some TikToks and pop up with some, on some Instagrams. We'll see some new influencers coming, uh, and dropping some, some knowledge about us dropping some, uh, showing chills about us, I guess, however you say it, but they're going to be talking about us.

(11:09 - 11:19)
And, uh, those are the NFT people really excited for that. Really excited to, to be working with those types of people. Um, so yeah, that's awesome.

(11:20 - 11:41)
Uh, what else we got? What else we got? We've been working behind the scenes. Again, things I can't talk about, uh, those, uh, fingers crossed those things, those things keep going through and it's going to be unbelievable. This everybody in this coin, um, is going to be early and we already are early and you guys are going to realize, holy shit.

(11:42 - 11:52)
The top 6,200 holders are early. Even if you're the 7,000th holder, even at the 10,000 holder, in my opinion, you're going to, you're going to be early. So just know that there's a lot of excitement on the way.

(11:52 - 12:02)
Um, I actually haven't even looked at the chart, um, probably in half, half a day. I was like, you know what? I don't even need to look at it because it doesn't affect what we're doing. So I told myself, I'm going to stop looking at it as much.

(12:03 - 12:10)
I'll just probably check in here and there to see what we have. It's definitely important. But people, there's algos in here, there's people just trading it.

(12:10 - 12:15)
It happens. They're not in the community. I'm sure that most of the people in the community are not even, they're not really selling.

(12:16 - 12:30)
They're probably, if anything, just buying because they know what we're doing. Um, so I don't get too concerned about it because I know the pipeline of things that we have and things take time. And I heard something somewhere, um, that a day in this, in this space is like a month.

(12:30 - 12:51)
And it's true because 27 days, man, I, I feel like I haven't slept and it feels like everybody in here probably hasn't slept. And I feel like we've been through 27 lifetimes, not just 27 days. Uh, so that's the cool thing is when we keep that day count, we realize, Hey, how young we are, but how much we've done and how much more we can go and look at the potential that we have.

(12:51 - 13:08)
Cause, and I'm going to keep reiterating this, but I just, I was looking at my phone today cause I was, I was going to send a reporter a picture of our logo. And right next to our logo was a picture of 100 holders, but it's like 100 hodlers. Hodler, whatever the word is.

(13:08 - 13:14)
Uh, and it said 100. I remember like hitting 100. It was like day five or day six.

(13:14 - 13:19)
And I was like, Holy shit. We got a hundred people in here. I'm like, this thing is awesome.

(13:19 - 13:24)
I have like 6,300 right now. Fuck a hundred. We don't need a hundred.

(13:24 - 13:27)
We have 6,300. That's unreal. Look at that.

(13:27 - 13:35)
Many holders are going, are going up. Our holders have gone up every day. And even if our price went down today or whatever it did, our holders went up.

(13:35 - 13:45)
So that's a bullish signal. That's awesome that our community is increasing because yeah, people that get in here early, they're going to sell a little bit of things. That's what's going to happen.

(13:45 - 13:58)
Like that's, that's going to happen. You know what I mean? Um, but the best part about it is that the number of people in the community are increasing. And once we had 10,000, man, like that is the breakthrough into the next step.

(13:58 - 14:06)
And we're going to hit that faster than you think. And then from there, it's going to be like, this thing's going to really pick up. And I feel like it's moving fast paced now.

(14:06 - 14:14)
In fact, there's so many moving parts. Once it hits 10,000, man, I feel like it's going to be like right before Thanksgiving. That's, that's my opinion.

(14:14 - 14:25)
That's my mindset. Hopefully before, fingers crossed before, but I think it's like right before Thanksgiving, this thing is going to explode at the holiday season. And, um, I'm absolutely juiced up about that.

(14:26 - 14:42)
Um, I couldn't be more excited. I think we, like our timing has been so perfect because I think that like these coins are becoming so popular again and we got in so early and we have such a great foundation built in such an amazing community. And you couldn't, you can't put a price tag on that.

(14:42 - 15:01)
You can't put a price tag on community because who else has a discord with like 700 people constantly active and 3,800 members, almost 4,000 members, uh, of people that actually visit the discord. Our telegram has what fricking over 2000, man. And it's awesome.

(15:01 - 15:10)
And, and people are talking that all day long. I'll like get off my phone or being a meeting or something like that. And I'll come back and I'll see like 463 missed messages in telegram.

(15:11 - 15:18)
I'm like, dude, it's been 35 minutes. Like what happened? Um, so that's awesome. That's absolutely awesome.

(15:18 - 15:26)
People are saying they can't hear me. I'm here in discord, you fricking silly guys. Um, but Hey man, tomorrow's Friday.

(15:26 - 15:35)
Um, always, as always, as always, as always, um, weekends always get tricky. People like to get their beer money. People like to do that stuff.

(15:35 - 15:44)
That's okay. Whatever, whatever happens happens. Uh, I know exactly how I feel about it and I know exactly how you guys feel about it.

(15:44 - 15:52)
Ryan just posted when the post-millennial article hits or the move, I will share a link here with all of you. I'm working on getting more media outlets. Dude, Ryan's the man we got to give it for Ryan.

(15:52 - 16:08)
I love his messages because it gets all the reactions and stuff. Ryan's a superstar. Like, I don't think you guys understand in this space, like how important Ryan is and many people do, and he's humble and he won't talk about it as much, but you talk to anybody in this space and Ryan is, is known and respected.

(16:09 - 16:17)
Uh, so for him to be here and for him to support this coin, and he said it so many times, he's like, dude, I don't support crypto things. And I don't do this. Like my page is not an advertisement.

(16:19 - 16:30)
Um, whoever, whoever made that tattoo thing is, is unbelievable. That is hilarious. But, um, whoever, uh, geez, that I just saw that cracked me up.

(16:30 - 16:37)
But, um, uh, what was I saying now? But Ryan, Ryan, you're the man. I think he's here listening. He texted me while I was on here.

(16:37 - 16:48)
I didn't read it, but Ryan, you're the man and we're freaking happy to have you. And like I said, we're building the monster team and he's our point guard and we got to, we had to have a point. We got like, we got like fricking, no, I wouldn't say Isaiah Thomas.

(16:48 - 16:55)
Cause Isaiah Thomas was, was in and out. Um, we got like Raejean Rondo in 2009. I mean, everybody hated on Raejean Rondo.

(16:55 - 17:00)
I thought he was unbelievable. Uh, so we got fricking, we got Ryan. He's the man.

(17:00 - 17:05)
He's a lot better than Raejean Rondo. I wouldn't do it. It's just like, we have, we have a team assembling.

(17:06 - 17:18)
Um, we, we got, um, probits coming to, uh, let me freaking message these suckers. Cause they, they messaged me and then they stopped messaging me and then they messaged me and they messaged me. So it's like, we're getting this thing going probe.

(17:18 - 17:21)
It's going to be up there. I'm excited for that. That's going to get a lot of international things as well.

(17:21 - 17:27)
We're, we're gearing our marketing to international, which is fucking awesome. Um, yep. Should be 1am.

(17:27 - 17:42)
So I'm about to message those suckers right now. Um, yeah, so I'm going to have fricking, I'm gonna get on the phone with those, with those guys after this thing. I'm, I'm still talking to you guys, uh, giving you guys the updates, but Hey man, awesome.

(17:42 - 17:43)
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

(17:43 - 17:52)
I think it was a really successful day. I was talking to one of our marketing guys and he was like, dude, this, this was a very successful day. And even if the price doesn't reflect it, tremendously successful in what's going on behind the scenes.

(17:52 - 18:03)
And you guys will, we'll all start to understand more. You guys will all start to realize it and you guys will all be tremendously excited. Um, so yeah, that's, that's the good word tonight on this Thursday night.

(18:03 - 18:13)
Nothing too out of the extraordinary things are picking up. Our foundation is strong where we built our house and we're still moving up. We're still moving onwards.

(18:13 - 18:23)
And Hey, this thing is, this thing is absolutely unbelievable. And I couldn't be more proud of the, of you guys. I couldn't be more proud of, of this team.

(18:23 - 18:28)
I couldn't be more proud of this development. Uh, everything top down. You guys are fucking unbelievable.

(18:29 - 18:33)
Uh, let's keep this thing going. Yep. USDT, uh, that's it.

(18:33 - 18:37)
Um, so, uh, that's exciting. Right. And I said, yep.

(18:37 - 18:44)
So Hey, great fucking day. Great Thursday. Let's roll this momentum into Friday.

(18:44 - 18:53)
Let's roll this momentum into this weekend. Once that post-millennial hits, dude, that's going to be big time. All right, everybody have a great night.

(18:53 - 18:58)
Keep shilling. I'm going to post, Oh, Oh, I'm gonna post this here. Um, yeah.

(18:58 - 19:05)
News on the decentralized media side. Uh, that's going to be fan boys. He's, he's taken that thing and he knows he has a great vision for it.

(19:05 - 19:12)
So he's got that all understood. He's got that all in the bag. We're going to have, we'll be building out a great team for that.

(19:12 - 19:25)
We're focusing right now on getting the coin, uh, off its feet and, and really just like into the stratosphere. And then that media site is, is, is working simultaneously and that's going to pick up a lot quicker than you understand. Um, yeah.

(19:25 - 19:40)
So a lot of exciting things I'm going to post. So there's this thing on Reddit and I know we get some big Reddit experts here. Um, and I would love if we could shill this, it's the, uh, crypto moon shots and we can, uh, we can make threads there constantly.

(19:40 - 19:53)
And that's going to be something that we really have to get into because they do their, like, uh, they pick their Monday coin and then they, and they, they, they do it from there. We could be that, we can be that Monday coin. Um, so let's do that thing.

(19:54 - 19:59)
Let's get this thing going. Uh, where is it? Do, do, do, do. Let me go to announcements.

(19:59 - 20:04)
This is going to be the shill the night. Let's take the fricking Reddit. If you don't have a Reddit, download Reddit.

(20:04 - 20:14)
If you don't know what Reddit is, Google it and then download a Reddit. And then, uh, let's get this thing going. I'm going to say shill and then I'm going to say control V and then we're going to shill this thing.

(20:15 - 20:24)
Let's get after it tonight. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Because I'm somebody new that you haven't told about this coin and tell them about this coin.

(20:24 - 20:31)
And then they're going to tell somebody about this coin and then their mom's going to know about this coin. So that's what we're doing tonight. We're getting the word out, getting the good word out.

(20:31 - 20:36)
Let's get to 10,000 holders before Thanksgiving. Like I said, let's get there. Let's do this thing.

(20:36 - 20:38)
Let's keep this thing flying. Good night, everybody.
