[Speaker 1]
Happy Tuesday! All right, as promised I told you I'll let you know if we weren't going to be done by the end of the month as we had planned. Between Saturday and today we've added, the team has decided to add a few details and features that I really think everybody will love.

Some of them the dev has already completed, others we're still waiting on a time estimate from him to kind of let us know how long that will take. So there's that update. Of course I am sorry that it's taking longer than expected but I really think at this point it's for great reason.

The features and details I think will be amazing and necessary. I think it'll make life a lot easier for everything but I will keep you updated as soon as I get that back from him. Are we thinking just a few more hours or days?

So a few things he's actually already completed today. I'm waiting on it. This is details that I don't, yeah I can't tell you.

I'm not a dev so as soon as he gets back to me on the time estimate for those changes then I'll definitely keep you updated. But after that's completed he still needs to test everything so that's kind of why we're running a little bit behind I would say at least days behind because testing hasn't even started. Yeah so it does feel really great I think about Saturday once we started.

I feel like he's so close to the finish line and what he's working on right now is where all the features and details are being added because up to this point I believe it was early last week there was a task that took him longer than expected to complete but other than that everything's just been going as planned and you know nothing really added as far as features versus what was originally planned. But the last few days like I said with these features and details, little details added. I say little but kind of big actually.

I can't wait to share them with you. I think I think everybody will be on board again unfortunately that means you know it's going to take longer especially when testing hasn't started but at this point we are trying to make sure everything is done correctly and where did we where did we find this dev? Through two different telegram mainly I'll say.

Um so let's see that's it really I haven't had any other updates. I thought the community was going to submit log logo designs that's the plan the team decided to go against that because they are looking for something very very very simple versus everything that kind of was being submitted. Is he she it's a he regarding our dev paid by the hour or for the task?

By the hour we just agree on we agree on the hours beforehand so as you know you let him know what we want he gives us an estimate once we agree on it then he starts work. When the logo is down to two can the community vote between the two? Yes however ultimately B&B will have the final decision so I think what we'll have do it you know it'll be divided up in some way but they'll know that hey the community is community likes this one so just I just want to kind of preface with that just to be completely transparent with you all.

Also we can have it you know if they pick if B&B pick the one the community decide or voted against we can have something like the community decide the colors so I think we can work with that I think we can compromise shouldn't be too hard and to be honest I don't remember with our last logo trying to remember if we even had B&B pick on the last one but I think that'll look good just going kind of for simple but something when people see it you know simple have some symbolism there and once people see it kind of know what it is especially since we're going the direction of Patriot Pay. I know I've gotten a few DMs regarding Patriot Pay and another business having Patriot Pay we are very aware of that that is a payroll and accounting service so that's definitely not in the same class of business.

Okay Black Eagle I'm not sure maybe you want to get muted. Did the dev give an estimate of how long testing takes? No because yes I should say but that's changed because what he added in the past few days Saturday and then this morning between Saturday and this morning is pretty big major changes so I'm not sure how much that will impact the testing hours but again as soon as I get that back from him let me check two hours ago I'm hoping tonight I will definitely update you.

Yeah I think what's his work been still banned from Telegram? I can't keep up because he was harassing everybody in here. Yeah that's really all I have I am super excited I feel like I could see the end the end is near and that's a huge relief now that we're getting down to to me the fun details I'm just very excited to share that all with you I do appreciate the patience yeah and I will update you as soon as we hear back from the dev regarding in quarter three mentions version 3 of the app.

What is planned for version 3? I think I think a lot of that answer will come once we go live with this task. Any shot we get to see this week?

I honestly cannot answer that until I hear back from him. As soon as I hear back I will update you. Will what is being worked on for May and June have more features apart from buying FGB and a few other coins?

So what's being worked on oh I'm sorry I can't really answer that but it'll be very soon that we'll get to share it all with everybody. I just can't answer because I don't want to give anything away. I keep giving little details here and there that might spill it and unfortunately I can't do that.

What is being worked on is something that I think the majority if not all of you it's something that you've all most have asked for something that is very necessary and again it'll be great for current holders, for the coin, for the app, for future holders. So I think it'll be great and I think that's why it's uh although I am very sorry it's taking longer than expected I think at this point it's taken so long that it's definitely worth it to add these features to make our lives easier in the coming months. Who wanted the additional upgrades?

It was brought up by one of our advisors. I should say it was started by one of the advisors and then when the conversation went from there and this started on Saturday then it's kind of started a whole cascade of ideas. Nothing that's you know like I said before that's necessary but but I think now that it's been discussed it feels like it's necessary.

I feel it's great. I need to write Boris an update tonight. Gotta get that turned in.

That's everything. As always if you have anything or need anything tag me or DM me. As always please don't share your seed phrase with anybody.

Your keys including me or admins or put them into any shady links. We haven't had an incident in a while and I'm very very glad about that so hopefully we won't anytime soon. Yeah just please don't share that with anybody no matter who and don't enter it into any weird links either.

Nobody no kind of support will ask you for that so let's keep that going. I feel like we need to have like a little board like no scammers. This many days since last scammer and it's been a while so which again it's great but it makes me nervous that's happening soon so just a little reminder there.

Yeah I'll keep you updated. I really am feeling I'm feeling great. I can see the end and that feels amazing.

The dev was scheduled by the way to be to have everything completed by the end of day today before we decided to add some more features and details by the way so yeah we'll see and I can't promise that there won't be more features and details added like I said when it started on Saturday it just kind of pivoted into a bunch of new ideas but at this point I think that's for the best and then of course testing will let you know how long that's supposed to go and I'll keep you updated through it all. We'll also I believe before the update goes live we will be emailing everybody whose email we have through the website and posting on here and discord to make sure everybody is aware of all the changes just to keep you all super updated. That's all I'm gonna say about that but yeah I think that's all I have today.

Thank you again for your patience. I hope everybody had a good weekend that is all. I'll talk to you all later.
