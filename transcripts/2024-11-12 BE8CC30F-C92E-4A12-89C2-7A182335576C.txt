[Speaker 1]
Hello, happy Tuesday. I hope everybody had a great weekend. I feel like I haven't done an actual voice for a while now, but thank you for your patience.

All right, let's get right to it. Let's see. We are waiting on a third party to fix an issue with direct on-ramping.

We will let you know as soon as that's complete. We are aware of some change now. Issues, again, still waiting on them to get that fixed.

Also, if you're having issues in the app, educational videos are still going. Website has quite a bit of new changes that will be ongoing. Also, the Rumble ads will continue going as we're working on the app.

And then we'll also start YouTube ads, which should also really help our SEO. I will keep you updated on those updates if I have them between voice chats. I am still getting emails from people who purchased very early on in the FJB app.

So if you have any friends or family, just remember to let them know. Again, they can contact me. Hopefully they have their seed freeze saved so I can help them through that.

I think that's all the updates I have for you all. Again, if you have any issues with your accounts, please reach out, call, DM, text, email. But I think that's all I have for now.

I will let you go. I am trying to get a recording from Boris, although the Trump elections really are huge for us. Not only for Patriot Pay going forward, but it means a lot with some of the legal things that we're working through through the FJB and Patriot Pay.

So that will be hopefully awesome for us, but we will keep you updated on any developments there. Again, I think that's everything. Thank you all for your patience.

Again, I will update you if I have any updates before the next voice chat. Otherwise, I hope to have an update for you again Friday. You all have a great night.

I will see you in general chat.
