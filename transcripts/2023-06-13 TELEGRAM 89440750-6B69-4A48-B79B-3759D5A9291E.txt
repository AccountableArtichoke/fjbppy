[Speaker 1]
Awesome. All right. Happy Tuesday.

I hope everybody's well. I'm feeling great. I feel great.

Today's been a great day, a great morning. I just wanted to come on here because I've gotten a few DMs of people, holders, wanting me to kind of summarize or revisit, reiterate some things that I've already shared with the community. And they feel like either some other holders maybe haven't listened to these voice chats when I shared all this or what have you.

So, yeah, I figured I'd get on here. I don't have any major updates, minus what I typed out in Telegram a few times today, which is that our dev has found a solution to the few issues he had. And he is back to testing again.

So I just wanted to reiterate, kind of revisit that everything, most everything being worked on is everything that the community has wanted very, very badly. Because it just makes sense for our coin to move forward, especially if we want to grow the way we are planning to grow. The reason that I can't share this task, and I know I see this all day, trying not to take it personal, is for the best interest of the coin and you, the current holders.

And then honestly, in some ways, even future holders. So it's not to be secretive or have you all upset with me, because I don't enjoy that. But it truly is for your best interest.

And I think you will understand why after everything's live, we can go back and revisit why, you know, the reasons. If you don't understand still why we didn't, I'm happy to revisit that and revisit or share the risks associated with that and why the team has decided that this is kept under wraps until it is live. So I just want kind of to, you know, just share that and make sure everybody's on the same page there.

Because I've seen a few people like, okay, well now you should share it. You know, trust me, I would love to share it so I can get you all off my back. But it would not be good for you.

It would not be good for the coin. It would not even be good for future holders. So that goes back to when we were having trouble getting approved for the task.

And I told you that I honestly, and I still feel this way, that I, you know, I strongly feel that a major reason it took so long was that B&B don't want you all upset. And they knew the risks and road bumps that we would have to go through to get this task completed. And that's, again, you know, like I said back then, I'll say now, by definition.

That isn't because, oh, FJB, we suck. We're da-da-da-da. The team is awful.

Nobody cares. B&B don't care. The dev is this.

No, this is by definition. And even once this task is live, there are going to be road bumps. It's not a question of, like, if.

It's, you know, it's when and what kind of road bumps are going to happen. So I do appreciate your patience, again, with that. But this is exactly why it took so long for B&B to finally get it approved because they don't want you all angry at them.

They want to make you happy. They want to make the community happy. And they want this to move in a positive direction.

So I just want to reiterate that. And that's the same with the people, you know, going off on Boris on Twitter or Getter. Please do keep that in mind.

And that goes along with, you know, events before that that happened. That is truly the same reason. We do not want to be a liability to B&B.

That's all I'll say. I'll keep that at that. But I would keep that in mind if I were you.

Again, this is for our best interest as a community. So that's all I can say on that. And, of course, everybody, you know, anybody is free to sell their own coins.

We haven't locked wallets or done anything crazy like that like the old team has. But I do, and again, I'm not saying that to protect B&B. I'm truly saying that because it is in the best interest of you, the holders, and the coin.

So I just wanted to reiterate that. I don't want it to be taken the wrong way, but do keep that in mind. Now, if you are here, we're going to have, again, some road bumps along the way.

Even as the task is completed, after it goes live, again, this is by definition, whether it's our dev or outside factors, even like what's happened with the set going after Binance, we've had to pivot several times. Obviously, we can't share that. So I understand where you're coming from and your frustration because it's easy for everybody on the team.

Well, we can see every detail and every update from the dev and we know what's happening rather than the updates I give you. But we can go back to me not sharing those little updates and just wait until everything's live. I just would rather not do that because some of you seems like really do appreciate the update, whether it is good or bad.

We are moving forward. The dev has been working. Usually, not much gets done on the weekend, but he was working all freaking weekend.

So that's great news. Again, we appreciate your patience, but that's, like I said, even with outside kind of factors that have gone, we've had to pivot. And again, I'm happy to revisit this once everything is live and completed.

If you all are interested in the details or what happened, we can go through that once everything is live and share that. I do believe it's 100%. It's going to be worth it.

And I do believe this is necessary to move forward. The team 100% believes this is necessary to move forward. Again, we can revisit that after it's live.

But it is, I can't say strongly enough how much I mean that. And I do believe all of you, most of you, some of you, you know, never going to be happy. But I do believe the vast majority will be very happy with this.

Again, it's everything you've asked for. It's everything we need to move forward. And yeah, move on from kind of the, you know, some of the crap we've had to deal with.

So I think that all kind of wraps it up. I do trust our team. And I understand that's harder for you because you haven't really seen, like this was, we haven't really done a major change like this before.

So I think as this becomes live, I hope that, I hope that that builds your trust with the team behind the scenes that is super, super knowledgeable, way smarter than I am, way more technical than I am. And I believe this will help you trust decisions that they are making behind the scenes to make sure, you know, I'm thinking of every little detail and everything that can go wrong and making sure we do everything we can to prevent that. Even if it is being extra, extra careful and taking extra precautions that are going to take a longer time.

You know, even if so-and-so is upset about it, understandably so. But I hope, I hope that makes sense. And again, I think once it goes live and, you know, we can revisit this, it'll make a lot more sense.

But yeah, I think this will help build your trust in the team doing all the work in the back and making these decisions to make sure that we're, yeah, really doing the best we can and avoiding almost everything that we can avoid at least. So it doesn't go to crap. So yeah, with that, please don't go at each other.

I understand you're super frustrated. If anything, feel free to take it out on me. But don't go at each other.

Just remember, we're all, you know, we all came here because at the end of the day, we just share many of the same beliefs and fighting the same evil. I think we can all agree on that. I think there was a few liberals in Discord, but yeah.

So please, you know, I see that going on again where you're kind of taking your frustrations out on each other. Don't do that. You can, you know, do it to me or go vent about me or say whatever you need to about me, but don't go at each other.

That makes me so sad. So I think that's really it. We will get through this.

I will keep you updated with everything. Just remember that testing is testing for a reason, right? We said from the beginning, if this changes, I will keep you updated, and I did.

If testing is not going right or, you know, like I said, a few things were thrown at us, we pivoted, but that's going to take time to make sure we get this right. This needs to be right. This needs to be done right.

It will be worth the wait. Like I said, it's everything that you've all asked for. It's everything that we need to move forward.

So yeah, that's it. But feel free as always to DM me or tag me if you have any questions. Also, please, please, please don't share your seed phrase with anybody.

Don't enter your seed phrase into any weird links. We haven't had anybody scammed that I know of for a while, so I'm very happy about that. Don't send money to anybody pretending to be me or any other mod.

I will never ask you to send FJB or BNB or anything like that. So please just be careful. I'm so, so glad that nobody has fallen for that in a while.

That's great news. How much testing needs to be done? I'm not sure.

I will update you once we are closer. And of course, if anything else pops up or anything else changes with the platform, for lack of a better word, that the dev is working on. Or if anything wild happens like the set going after Binance and then we need to poop it again.

Did you say the dev would come on voice after it goes live? Yes, the dev said he's actually happy to come on voice whenever we just decided, the team has decided, that we will not have him on voice until after the task is completed because we don't want him to accidentally reveal the task. He said he's happy to do that, so that's very nice of him.

He's a very nice guy. If in the future we do fork, what chains are the teams looking at? There's several we've looked at.

I think you can ask Pierre and Nolan of all the ones they've suggested. But yeah, we'll get there when we save all the XT and LBank relisting fees. Maybe then we can change our FJV name too.

Let's go Brandon. Did we get a new timeline? No, we have not gotten a new timeline.

As of this morning, the update I got was the dev found a solution to the latest issue he ran into. He had found a solution to the other one, which was great. And yeah, he's been testing today.

So I actually have some DMs from him to check on. So yeah, I will keep you updated. Like I said, we are moving forward.

And remember that this task, by definition, is going to come with more roadblocks even after we are live. So please do keep that in mind. Again, we appreciate your patience.

I can assure you that everything the team is doing is for the best interest of the coin and you, the holders. Like I said, honestly, even future holders. So yeah, I think that is all.

I hope you have a great evening. Are we going live after this task? Yes.

So this task, once it's completed, we will share with the community once it is live. But like I said, that will come with its own set of roadblocks. But we'll get through it.

We'll help you all through it. And we can finally move forward. So yeah, I'm super excited to finally not be secretive with you all and share everything and for everything to kind of make, everything on the back end to make a lot more sense on the front end.

I am looking forward to that day. Yeah, I think that's great. And I think Boris is also looking forward to that.

All right. You all have a wonderful night. I will post a recording right now.

I know Ed said he's traveling. So he wanted that recording. But I will record it in case anybody else sees it, needs it.

With bullet points in case you don't want to listen to me rambling. Idea on task completion timing. I do not have a time for that right now.

Just with everything that's going and everything the dev got resolved this morning. We're hoping it all goes smoothly through testing. So far, so good.

But again, I will keep you updated as that changes. Remember that it is testing for a reason. So if testing doesn't go as expected, then the dev will have to pivot and find a way to get it done.

And that takes time. So I am sorry about that. Makes me wish I was a dev so I could help out.

All right, you guys have a great night. Thank you.
