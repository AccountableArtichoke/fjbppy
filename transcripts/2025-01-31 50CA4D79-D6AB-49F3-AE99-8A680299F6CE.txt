[Speaker 1]
Hi guys, happy Friday. Hope everybody had a great week. Hope you've had a great January.

Mine seems like it lasted forever. I just wanted to get on here, update you really quickly. Again, I'm not replying to DMs. That is nothing personal. I just can't do that right now. Um, so if I'm not responding to your DMs and texts and calls, um, I promise it's nothing personal. Um, I just can't do that right now.

Um, hopefully I will get to share that. Um, and then I'll get to DM you all back very soon. Um, so I just wanted to get on here and update you.

We'll get right to it. Um, we have the marketing scheduled with War Room, uh, Maureen and Steve, and I'll, um, read it out straight to you. So weeks one to two, I'm sorry, that's my bird.

Um, so the first and second week we'll do two mentions a week on the War Room Telegram channel. This'll help us, um, get, you will do the two mentions a week in the Telegram channel, and then we'll do, uh, two mentions a week on the War Room social media to just help us ramp up that volume there. And then, um, week four on, so week five and onward, it'll be the two mentions a week in the War Room Telegram channel, two mentions a week on the War Room social media, and then one mention a week on the War Room show by Steve.

Um, so that's what we have right now. We are just waiting on Mo to see when we can start that up. I will let you know as soon as I have that date.

Um, we are, all the other updates as, um, far as the app and everything else is waiting on that. Um, that is, there is, we're completely waiting on that, um, once we get that, the date for that on when we can start the marketing is when we'll be back in motion for everything else. Um, yeah, I think, uh, I think that should make most everybody pretty happy.

Um, I think I am very happy with it, uh, and I think we'll do very well on that schedule. So, uh, yeah, I'll leave you with that. I will update you as soon as I have an update.

Um, I'll be reaching out to Mo again. I was talking to her pretty much all this week. I'll be reaching out to her Monday throughout the weekend.

She has been traveling a ton, so, um, and then War Room's just been insane. Um, but, uh, like I said, I'm hoping to get that, uh, date this coming week. I will update you as soon as I have a date.

Um, thank you all so much. Hope you have a safe and wonderful weekend.
