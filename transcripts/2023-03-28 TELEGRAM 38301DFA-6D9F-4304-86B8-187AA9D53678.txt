[Speaker 1]
Hello. Happy Tuesday. Can you all hear me?

Awesome. Is the sound okay? Music sounds bad, cuts in and out weird.

I don't know why. Okay. Sorry about that.

All right. Well, happy Tuesday. Thank you for your patience.

I know it's a late call. We do have the recorder going. I don't have any major updates yet.

Very, very excited for what's to come. We'll have some feedback we'll need from you all very shortly. What about minor updates?

Minor updates. Let's see. I don't know if I can give anything.

All the updates really tie in with each other. I did hear from Boris today. Boris is asking questions, good questions.

Him and Steve definitely want to grow the community. How about that? That's a minor update without giving you everything else.

They're really, really, really wanting to do that. So I think that's great news. Peter knows all about minors.

Oh, my goodness. Would be cool to find out what is going on with this LP with 600 million FJB in it. Does Grant control that?

Is it dead? Oh, I'm pretty sure that's dead, but I will double check for you. I think that's, yeah, the 600 million that was sent.

I believe they F'd that up. Let me search. I have it in my notes.

It was accidentally sent. Let me see. Let me search my notes for you.

Yeah, it's like 635 million. But yes, that was sent. How are current funds to finance FJB through marketing wallet and charity tax sales doing?

Is Bella working on app development? No. How are current funds to finance FJB through marketing wallet and charity?

Sorry, I'm not sure what that means. But everything's still being finalized. Does FJB have money in the bank?

Yes, we are definitely still working on that. And everything looks amazing and will be a huge help moving forward. Oh, marketing, over-the-counter marketing sales have ended.

So for those of you that took advantage of that, great, congrats. The team decided to put an end to that just because of the way it will continue impacting the LP. So just a little bit better for the community, but we do thank you and thank everybody who participated because it did help keep the price up when marketing wallet did not have to sell and just sold it over-the-counter to you.

Is Bella still on the team? Yeah, I think most everybody's still technically on the team. Are Boris and Bannon participating in the roadmap and white paper?

Yes. Was a great idea? Yes.

Great idea. And pretty sure that was you guys' idea. And it really did help us and we do appreciate everybody that took advantage of it.

Still expecting announcement in quarter one. Let's see. I'm trying to word this.

I think we can expect, we can definitely expect some announcements, some updates in quarter one. Absolutely. The big one, I'm not sure, will be completed by this Friday.

But I think we're on track to definitely have some updates for everybody. Would be nice to see or hear of any kind of action to all from the bees. They seem to be moving at the speed of backwards.

Oh, what do you mean? They seem to be moving at the speed of backwards. Do you just mean them being in here like for voice chats?

Just hear anything. Okay, but I mean, hear anything as far as them like mentioning FJB on War Room like they have several times or coming straight directly to the community. Yes, the presentation was positive.

What about next Friday for the big announcement? It does depend largely on B&B. But I believe it's still possible.

No, I'm sorry. I'm just wanting to know what you were asking. So I know how to answer with accurate info.

As far as speaking directly to the community, we have one more thing to go through. One more step. Kindling Violet says, I'm very happy that the name of the coin is not changing.

I hope it won't be just for the time being. That's true. Freedom jobs business.

Is rebrand just the app then? For the time being. And the gift card.

So we have the gift cards completed. They have been completed. However, with the rebrand and everything else, once that's officially announced to the community, and a logo is agreed upon, then we can go ahead and get that edited on the gift cards.

But the gift cards are technically live. The reason they've not been added to the website is because of the changes we have coming. It would be more than just the logo and the rebranding.

It would be a big pain to do gift cards now and then have them changed in some way. Sorry, I don't want to give too much info out. I know there's people still with...

If you're still having issues with your Transac account, please DM me. So I can send them another list. I know I have one from Stacy.

Yes. I did see that. Thank you.

I'm sorry I've not received an update on that, but I will check on it again. Somebody flying by in a motorcycle. The chart's looking nice.

Very, very nice. It's nice having people come in and ask, What happened? The people that we haven't seen for months.

Or people DMing me that I haven't seen their names for anything. In several months. Asking because they're buying back in.

Can we do a few FJB giveaways leading up to the big announcement like the good old days when Fuego was there? Yes, sure. We definitely can.

I'm sure. I think Fuego's still around. When are you buying back in?

That hasn't changed, Tim. As soon as I know that I don't need those funds for FJB. Because I think that would be...

Yeah, I'd like to have those funds just in case. I don't want to run into that issue again. Will Velo supervise the dev team?

Likely. I do not have an answer for that yet. But Velo's always been amazing to us.

We rockin' the chart. Yeah. No kidding.

That's what's so funny about it is people just coming in, What happened? And everyone's like, What do you mean? Why is the chart up?

Why is this at the top of my list? It's kind of nice. Where's BNB at?

Let's see. BNB at $313.87. Do you have a set amount in market that you want before you buy back in? Um, no.

We're just... We have a lot coming up. A lot.

And, yeah. We know that goes quick. Lots of cash for very good stuff.

Gotta spend money to make money. Need to get going. I haven't had haircut for 17 months.

What? Have a good night. Have a good night.

Have a great night, Bob. Bob's been around forever. Like a really long time.

Hearts? Um, yeah. I can't wait.

Yeah. I can't wait. I'll be up late tonight.

Last night, to be honest, I was feeling fine. I stayed up until almost 10pm, which for me is super late. Because I wake up usually before 3am now.

But my eyes were shot, so I had to go to bed. Because I could not look at the computer screen anymore. But tonight, I did, uh...

I have been wearing my glasses all day. I'm supposed to wear glasses if I'm on the computer. So I think that'll help.

And then I got a little break from my doctor's appointment. So I should be up pretty late and hopefully get a ton done. Because I hope, um...

I want to really have something to share with you all before Friday. I think it'll be really good. Have the devs mentioned anything about how long it'll take them to get the app fixed and changes to design?

Um, really, to get fixed should be a super, super simple, simple fix. But they kind of never know until they dive into it. I know last time everything, like major, to get everything just working was just a few days.

So I think that's, uh, yeah. It's hard to predict, um, is what I always hear from them, which I hate hearing. But I don't anticipate it'll take too long just from how it's worked before.

So the main holdup is getting B&B to give the announcement? Um, kind of just working all the details. There is a lot.

There is so, so much. Um, and a lot of it, a lot of it is like the plan that we had for FJB before. That unfortunately didn't come to fruition.

I'm very, very, very excited. So how involved will Mike Lindell be with the community? Wouldn't that be amazing?

Ugh. He's gotta let us in on my store first. As soon as we drop the FJB, hopefully.

I hope so. I'd love to have him on. I think that's been an idea for, gosh, how long?

How cool would that be? Or even for us, like, simply just to even have our merch in a store. That would be awesome.

With the money coming in, has that expanded what you are able to do? Or are you guys thinking about what's down the road? Not completely sure what you're asking, to be honest.

Definitely devs and getting our app fixed. That's number one priority, right? If the app is not functioning, we are not going to be asking people to download it.

Essentially, that's the first step to kind of get everybody hooked on us. But after that, of course, advertising, events. This all takes, as you know, money to get out there and get the word out there.

But, I mean, again, go back to Wire Day before they screwed us and canceled us. Which might be the best thing that's happened to us now. And hopefully will end up being the best thing that's happened to us after we get through all of this.

But, honestly, I can't. It was just so surreal that day. I mean, you guys saw the charts.

And it was all, it wasn't existing users pumping the charts. You know, I'm sure there are people who are still buying from the community, right? But I was sitting there doing the, just the, it wasn't chats, it was emails.

It was like tech support emails. And they were just coming in like crazy. And it was so cute.

It was like the oldest people I can tell from their emails and the questions they were asking. So I think that alone, even just having more room and asking Bannon, hey, asking, Bannon asking, you know, his viewers to, hey, download the app and buy some FJB coin. Rebranding FW, which equals FWire.

Well, I think they burned down themselves. Is that what we saw? Everything happens for the greater glory of those who love God.

That's true. So nice to see you. I think yesterday, I was like, where's all his glory to send us prayers?

I tried tagging you, but I think I forgot this handle you have. Nick Nifty. At work sneaking in here, bud.

Anyone else going to, anything else going to happen with Nick Nifty? As far as I know, they actually have some pretty big plans for the bull market. It's been a few weeks since I talked to their founder.

He's actually doing very well. Shout out to the we the people rocking social media. Yes, he is freaking amazing.

Thank you so much. Good night, Zanny. Wire, shit was bad, but going from virgin one, two, three, yes, absolutely.

Wait, Bob, didn't you say you left? I thought you were leaving to get a haircut. Sam, my goal, and I am literally going to stay up for the next few nights, is to have, yeah, at least, likely not the really, really, really big announcement.

But I think if you, I just don't want to share anything until it's 100% worked out. Bob was saying the coin needed to get going so he can get a cut. Oh, I didn't realize that's what he was saying.

Thank you, we the people. Are we forking? Ah, no, I think that'll cause way too much of a mess.

However, once we can afford to be listed on XT and LBank, a cool 100K or so, I think that's being discussed, right? Because then we can change our name, we can remove Wounded Warriors. There's a few pros.

I think it would work out well for the holders, too. And a new chart. Then JAS can stop saying we're down like 98%.

Why pay them twice? They can't work with you? It's crazy that they don't.

Yeah, I've tried so hard. Drop XT, nobody uses it. So that's the downside, right?

Is that these exchanges are valuable because think about it. Right now, like, okay, nobody uses XT or barely anybody uses, you know, pretty low volume on XT and LBank, right? But if, I have to say that, if FJB explodes, then you would expect a lot more volume there.

And that becomes very, very valuable. So that's kind of why that's a big deal. Remove Wounded Warriors.

Yeah, so Wounded Warriors, they're written in our contract, right? But I believe it was after our first donation. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, just going off memory here.

But I believe it was after our first donation that they let us know they don't want to be associated with us. So they don't want their name on, you know, on anything. Advertisements, announcements, or anything like that.

Or us announcing even that we donated to them. So I think that would be a very good thing to do as they wish. Sorry, I'm not on voice chat.

What are we getting announcements right now? That's what the app is for, yeah. No, I completely get it.

But, again, the value and the exchanges. Oh, I didn't know that, actually. Huh.

Win NASCAR. I read somebody in here was saying something about NASCAR. Quit personally donating.

I do donate my time. But that's mostly to orphans and feeding people. Need to sponsor a car.

Ooh, FJB Cruise. That'd be nice. I'd be down.

Here comes the boss. Good night. Nighty night.

So B&B are wanting to expand and promote the project. They sound excited. Yes.

They really want to grow the community and they're ready to do whatever that takes. So that is super exciting. I think with all the coming changes, it'll be great.

Can't wait to share more with the community. Looking into a crystal ball. What are your high-low predictions for six months from now based on the changes coming?

Not holding you to them, just curious what you think it might look like. I hope we get all-time high and beyond in the next six months with the upcoming changes. And I do believe that is possible.

With our marketing funds being placed correctly and where they are intended to go. I think that'll be a piece of cake. I anticipate it will be.

Not saying we're not going to have hurdles, but you get the idea. I'm done with that. There's Bob again.

Thank you for blessing us with your presence, Bob. You just can't leave us alone. What will marketing look like?

Are B&B going to greenlight you to spend money? Yes, absolutely. Can't wait for that.

Organic growth, yeah, I think it'll be great. We'll talk more about that soon. Reset all-time high with B&B being over 600, so we need some help on that.

Yeah, absolutely. I agree. I think with new holders and old holders, there's a lot of old holders still waiting to put money in.

Again, not saying there won't be hurdles. I'm sure there will be. But I don't think we'll have a problem with that.

When next live drinking games? We can do that whenever. What did I miss?

Not much, really. You want to see my nest? What?

It was actually really sad. We got our tree in our front yard. It's like an oak tree, I think.

It got trimmed down a ton, and of course all the nests with it. And then I found some little tiny eggs on the grass under it. That was so sad.

So then I was thinking we should have moved the nests beforehand. But a little late. I still make my native drink.

What is it? What was your drink then? DadO4.

Well, I know, but what was in it? Sounds like a good time. Nice.

That sounds like, uh, do you remember anything like an adios? And I remember Z made the lemon drop with his fresh lemons. Alright, any other questions?

Sorry I don't have any updates really today, but...

[Speaker 2]
Getting closer.

[Speaker 1]
I'm like Trump and don't drink. I didn't know that about him. But it's probably a lot better for you.

Well, it is a lot better for you. 1FJB, $1, want to have $200 million. Same.

We honestly need to get the ball rolling. The stage is set, they get the devs working, new holders involved, marketing, staking, burning, etc. I'm with ya.

1FJB, wispy. Oh my gosh. We are very, very, very close, yes.

I think it'll be great coming few months. Well, even after that, but I think it's going to be a lot of changes and everybody will be very happy with a lot of what's to come, finally. When Difcordia and FOMO, when happy.

That's what I want to know, when happy. Tune, everything. Alright, I think that's all.

I don't see anybody typing. As always, let me know if you have any questions. DM me or tag me in the chats.

Yeah, Vlad, I have not been able to answer you because I've been on the voice chat. Oh, he's probably not on the voice chat. Okay.

Alright, well, let me get back to Vlad. You all have a wonderful night. Let me know if you need anything.

I will be here. Yeah. In the meantime, I'll see you back in chat.

Thank you all for your patience. We'll talk soon. If anything major happens before Friday, I will update you instead of waiting for Friday.

Alright, you guys have a great night. Bye.
