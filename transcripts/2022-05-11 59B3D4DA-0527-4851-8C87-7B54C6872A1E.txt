[Speaker 3]
You guys missed me or what?

[Speaker 2]
Dawn, everybody. How are we?

[Speaker 1]
What are we doing? Do I sound... I feel like I sound like I got a sinus infection because I have a sinus infection.

So if I sound awful, I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry. I'm sick again. I've been sick.

If you guys want to know something about me, I literally never get sick. This project happens. And what?

We started in October. This is now... No COVID.

I got tested, Drew. I got tested. No COVID.

Clean as a whistle. I probably get that for... I probably...

You know what? You don't know why I'm sick. It's because I never got vaxxed.

And I was the only person I know probably in real life that didn't get vaxxed. And I always talk smack because I never got COVID. And I was like, I never got COVID.

You guys are all silly. I'm the winner. You guys are all going to have problems from the vaccine.

And guess who's not? It's going to be Grant. And then guess who gets sick like four times in January?

I'm raising my hand right now because it's FJB Grant. It's me. So I'm good.

I got a sinus infection. My nose is bleeding like crazy. That's fine.

It's fine. You want to know the cure to this sinus infection or whatever I have? It's Franks.

It's more Franks. Exactly. Franks.

Somebody said Franks. There it is. That's all you need.

That's the Frank. And that's all you need. That's really all you need.

I'm fired up about it. I'm fired up about it. I'm good.

But I just wanted to say hello, everybody. Happy Wednesday, May 11th. Who the hell would have thought that on May 11th that you guys would still be listening to me?

You want to know how crazy this is? Let's type in our old trusty friend on Google. How many days ago was October 22nd?

201 days ago. That is crazy. I feel like this has been like a thousand lifetimes, but it's been the best thousand lifetimes ever.

I miss you guys too, Chicago Jacobs. I miss you guys all. I'm so glad to see all these familiar faces in here.

I'm looking at everybody in here. We have all the normal crowd. I love it.

We have Jeff Roach in here. We got Chicago Jacobs. We have Logical Joe.

We have Al Horford. We got, who else we got? We got Urban.

There he is. Why is my thing not working? Now I'm frozen.

Can you guys still hear me? Let's see if I can click out of this. One second.

Yeah, okay. We got Turok. We got Haz.

We got Ryan. We got FJB Drew. We got a new name, Ultra Short Bus.

Sun Devil, Logical Fees, everybody. WEG. It's not WEG, but it's WEG.

So we have a lot of people in here. I miss you guys all. You know what we got to do?

We got to allow everybody in here. We got to allow Stonky Leg. We got to bring back Pirate.

Somebody has to find Pirate. If somebody can find Pirate, we got a million FJB bounty on his head. So if somebody can find Pirate, somebody's getting that milli.

Who else are we missing? Blue Face. We need Blue Face back.

Fuego. Bring back Fuego. Bring them all back.

Gianna, exactly. Gianna, everybody. Bring them all in here.

We need them all. So it's a great day. Everybody, I'm so excited to be talking about everything.

I haven't done one of these in a long time. But you want to know why I'm doing this? It's because we have a group chat, and Finman was talking about it.

And Finman was like, hey, I'm going to do a voice tonight. And I was like, Finman, that's a great idea. And Finman fired me up.

I don't know about you guys, but Finman really did fire me up. And I was really excited about it. And I was sitting there, and I was like, you know what?

I'm going to do a voice this week. And now we're here. And I am so happy that I did because I miss talking to you guys.

I miss doing this. And this is something that I've said a couple times recently. I was like, oh, I'm going to do this more.

I kind of back out of it. But this is something that I definitely want to do more. And the reason why I haven't been doing it as much is because I'm not as in the loop as some of you guys may think.

I know that I've been the voice here. I remember the first 62 days I did voices, 60 out of those 62 days. So I know that you guys are so familiar with me.

People from V1, people from V2, early V3, you guys associate me with FJB. But since everything has changed back in December 2nd, yeah, we're Big Money Mike. We need Big Money Mike in here.

But everything that has changed since what? Sierra, there's a lot of love for you, too. But I'm still here.

Like I said, I will be the last person in this Discord. I feel like this Discord has been not stagnant in terms of the activity. However, the number of people in the Discord has been around the same number, like that 6,500 to 7,000.

[Speaker 2]
In the beginning, because we've had so many ups and downs, the roller coaster ride, kind of everything that happened. If we're talking about the app, quote, unquote, canceled us.

[Speaker 1]
I know you guys all remember this. You guys were all here for that. It sucked.

I felt like the life kind of got drained out of me because of everything that happened, of all of the work that we put in. And it wasn't even for me. This whole project really hasn't been for me.

I just remember looking at the Discord and the Telegram, and I was like, I need to step away because I just felt so awful. I was like, this was so out of our hands. However, that was one of those things where you can't question God's plan.

And I'm a big believer in that, and everything happens for a reason. And it was one of those crazy things where I was like, we did nothing wrong. We did everything the right way.

FJB has always done everything the right way. And I was like, what could we have done differently? And it was like playing that Monday morning quarterback to kind of like sulk for a day.

But the thing with feeling sorry for yourself is 90% of the time when you feel sorry for yourself, nobody cares. And 10% of the time, people are happy that you feel sorry for yourself. So if you're ever feeling sorry for yourself, it's like there's really no reason to because I was sitting there, and I was like, you know what?

This sucks. Like, I can't believe that we're here. We were this close at the goal line, and we fumbled.

And I was like, what do we do? I feel like I let everybody down. And I felt like I just felt really bad.

And what we said was, hey, let's just try to find another solution. We have a tremendous dev team, special ed. A lot of people behind the scenes have been working countlessly still to this day.

And where we're at right now is we're missing one thing from Trans Act, and that's just essentially a legal letter. And we're working on that. We're getting that.

Is it working as fast as we would like it? No. It's okay because it's – I wish that I was a lawyer because I wish I could just snap my fingers and have it done.

However, working with lawyers and working with regulators to make sure that everything is perfect by the time we do this again so we don't announce and then go on War Room, blow it up, and have the whole marketing rollout that we've been talking about for so long and been preparing and then look like a bunch of fools when we get canceled, quote, unquote, or it doesn't work. So this time around, we're essentially certifying that everything is going to be perfect before we put our foot on the gas. You want to know why?

Kind of like always God's plan, God's timing. Look at the market right now. Look at inflation numbers that came out today, 80.3%. Look at Bitcoin. It's under $30,000. It was at $68,000 at one point. Now we're under $30,000.

And it's so crazy. And you look at supply chain issues. You look at what's going on with Ukraine and Russia.

I feel like that picture of that wolf that's getting fired at with arrows, it's, like, sticking out through the sides, but he's still standing and he's still going. That's what I feel like FJB is because we've been working so hard and we've gone through so much shit. I'm not cursing.

This is a curse jar. It's a swear jar. We've gone through so much stuff, so much bad stuff since the beginning.

And you guys remember that. We've had so many ups and downs, like even going back to, like, forks in the beginning because the code was a little bit wrong. Or we were trying to get QCoin, and there was road bumps there.

Or we were trying to get even, like, influencers like David Harris Jr. We were trying to do all that and road bumps there. And I feel like this whole project has just been like, okay, you feel like it's going to be a straight line, and you get knocked off. But no matter what, whenever we go two steps backwards, we go three steps forward.

We always bounce forward, and that's what this project is continuing to do. That's why we're still working on these other solutions. And you guys are seeing this in real time because we are not leaving.

It's not like we're ghosts. And what I wanted to say is what Finman really did was he fired me back up because he's never lost hope. And Eric Finman is a guy, as you know, who has made a tremendous amount of money.

He recently sold Freedom Phone. As you guys probably see that price tag, you can Google it. And he is an extremely wealthy person.

Money is, at this point, is really not as important to him as it is for a lot of people. However, he's working 24-7 on this project. And you want to know why?

It's because he believes in it. And we have people like Steve Bannon, who is one of the most influential people in America, who's still working on this project. They have so much stuff to do and so much to cover and so little time in the day.

And they're still continuing to work on this stuff. That just goes to show that it's bigger than just an app. It's bigger than just a coin.

But this is something that they really believe in. And that's why I really love it because I had this vision back in October. And now it's May, 201 days later.

And more people have this vision. Yes, does the vision seem cloudy or hazy sometimes? 1,000%.

I'm sure that every single person in this Discord has had some type of doubt. I know that for a fact. However, you guys wouldn't be here typing messages or sitting listening to me at 9.49 p.m. Eastern. Talk about this coin still. Talk about this app. Talk about the updates if you guys didn't care.

But you guys care because it's bigger than just that. It's bigger than just a coin. You guys genuinely enjoy loving being in this Discord.

You guys genuinely made great friendships and great memories through this. I know that we're never going to be listening to that song Puppet Up the same way. It just won't happen.

That's just the way it is. And that's really the reason why I'm still here. I knew that I was always going to still be here because of this.

Because I love this coin. It's really, really incredible. It's so amazing.

And look at the market. We're in a really crappy spot. Absolutely.

With everything going on with the President of the United States. I don't have to name names. But the reason why we started this coin was because of him.

And kind of all of our predictions have essentially come true. But he is technically the captain of our ship. And you don't want your own ship to go down.

You know what I mean? So we all just want America to be in a better place. And we all want America to turn the tide and do what we do best.

And that's do it better than anybody else. And I just saw somebody post, so no app this week. I'm still getting to that.

We are not setting any timelines. The team will not set any timelines. However, we're waiting on that transact from the lawyer.

Once we get that all squared away, I will have more clarity on when we can give that specific date or timeline. Again, we don't want to say something and, I guess, take a misstep. You know what I mean?

But the great thing is we're still here. That's the most important part that I wanted to emphasize tonight is we're still here. We're still listening with how many people?

We have 145 people listening. Crazy. We've seen a lot of faces come and go.

But the reason why we're still here is because we still believe. And I still believe more than ever. And if you guys want to know a secret, there's something called midterms coming up, which is essentially when you're back in school and you're taking midterms to see how you're doing.

And if you guys have taken notice of the current administration, they're really not doing that great of a job. So. My prediction is something's probably going to change during midterms.

I'm sure that we all have some similar types of. Predictions, correct? And I don't really think that there's much.

Better of a coin when all these coins are doing so poor than a freedom jobs and business coin, a.k.a. an F. Joe Biden coin. When he is really doing a crappy job.

So guess who's still around the freedom jobs and business coin. That's why we're still here. That's why I'm still excited about this thing is because we're not going away in all of this work.

All of this effort that we're putting in. Is not going to go unwavered. It won't.

We've done too much for it to not succeed. That's why we're still here. That's exactly why I'm still standing here in my office with a headset on talking to you guys at almost 10 p.m. Eastern. It's because. Everything else can go to crap. But you want to know something crazy is what everything goes to crap.

Who is to blame? Who's the finger getting pointed at? And then you can turn around and you think, oh, wow, there's actually a coin.

That emphasizes this. And that's us. That's us.

That's the people that are making this up. That's this discord. It's because we are all here.

And somebody said 10 p.m. is not late. This is my bedtime. This is late.

However, I wanted to push it back to make sure everybody can get here from the West Coast, because I know we have a lot of people West Coast and everything like that. Somebody said, how about a couple of hints at marketing plans? Yes.

And give a couple of hints, a.k.a. Fox Business, a.k.a. Some some really good articles with Politico. Essentially, Finman, Boris Bannon going on tour about this app, really expanding this app to more than just cryptocurrency. And that's going to come with different versions of it.

[Speaker 2]
We're using this app. We're pushing forward. And we're pushing into midterms.

[Speaker 1]
That's about all the hints I'll give about the marketing. You guys will see some some more things come into fruition. Somebody said, well, the exact LP be relocked immediately when it comes.

Yes, absolutely. One thousand percent, literally at the same exact second will be relocks. Do not worry about that.

I'm positive if anybody has been here since the early days when we relocked it. You guys, I know we're probably worried. However, we relocked it immediately and there was no worries at all.

So if you guys trusted us that first time, please trust us again, because we've done nothing but build trust. I know we've been off with some timelines. We've done nothing but build trust.

Transparency is back. I know that our transparency has been a little bit lower recently because, again, I'm a little bit more in the dark and I haven't been as active. And I apologize, but.

But transparency is back. And as much as I know and as much as I see, I will let you guys know. Is there a plan B in case transact doesn't play nice?

Absolutely. We have a lot of irons in the fire. You have a lot of different things that we're working on just in case because of what happened the first time.

What happened the first time was a little bit of a shock. But immediately the team was like, hey, what's next? Next, next man up.

It's on deck. And that's what we did. And some of the things could have been worked on a little bit more in the back end beforehand.

We didn't really see that happening. There was like a 1% chance of you said, hey, Renee, I canceled. And it did.

But it happened. Can't change it.

[Speaker 2]
That's what life is. But the truth is, that's life.

[Speaker 1]
And we're going to keep moving forward. We're going to keep doing this. We're going to keep pushing forward and we're going to keep grinding.

We're going to keep doing what we do. And that's working hard. That's what everybody in this discord does.

I see a lot of people messaging. Hey, I'll be back on later because I have to go to work. I have to go do something.

I have to go work hard. That's part of us. That's who we are in our bones.

I'm so happy to be up here still doing this. I'm going to do this until today's Wednesday. I will give another update.

I'm not going to give a specific day. But we'll be very, very soon on what's going on. And you guys will know more as I know more.

But I just wanted to thank everybody for listening today. You guys have been true to this since the beginning. And I love each and every one of you guys.

And I'm just really excited for the future because you guys deserve it. After all of these shenanigans, you guys deserve it more than ever. And I can't wait for the one-year anniversary of FJB when we can take an FJB cruise or something and we can have a blast together because you guys deserve it more than anybody.

So, everybody, have a great night. Be safe, please. Keep it up.

If you have more time, get a little bit more active in the Discord. The marketing, more people are going to be coming into the Discord. So always be friendly.

I know that sometimes people can't be friendly, including me. Like I just told CryptoGuy to shut up, but I'm sorry. I'll tone it down.

But have a great night, everybody. Love you. ELD, everybody.

Love everybody. We're never getting out of that. Never staying away from that.

However, let's keep pushing forward. Let's keep doing us.

[Speaker 2]
Good night.
