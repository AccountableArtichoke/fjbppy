It's just a matter of announcing it I know you guys were like on our you're like, oh my god, we need the news Fucking grants been talking about it every night You don't think if you think I don't want to announce this or don't say anything you're so silly because I want to say this more than anybody else because this is going to Juice the coin up to the to the nines So obviously I want to tell you guys that's like it's it's not as easy as it sounds because this is a big thing It's not like it's not like we're just getting Endorsed by somebody or it's not like we're getting Instagram posts, it's not like we're doing something like there's gonna be tremendous changes that are happening So for all of it to come out and be done with is a lot To roll out takes a lot of money to roll out to it's not as easy as it sounds where it's like Oh, you can just roll out right now and And get everything squared away You know what? I mean? It's not like Trying to think of a way to compare it but for something like this you need a lot of stuff behind the scenes You need a lot of things Figured he said he can't announce it I exactly if I if I could announce it I would I could like we everything signed squared away I'm the deal is done everything set up now. It's just a matter of figuring out the best way To roll this out and Setting everything up before we do because it's one of those things where it's like you got that one shot You really got to do it the best way possible So the best way possible is not to announce it on a discord. 

It's not to do it on a voice call right now Yes, you guys are going to be hearing it very quickly. I've given out so many hints I've given out so many hints you guys have you guys have seen it Even look at this. I'll send one of these right here one second There you go. 

That'd be one of those About that and how about this? So you guys have seen you guys have seen my hints you guys have seen it It'll make sense people are saying an answer now that I've never even seen before never even seen so I Would think you feel oh, dude, Bob 24. You have no idea. I can't even sleep. 

I barely even sleep you guys price out here I exhausted I am Literally, I think about this thing all day long. I don't stop. So this is what I Constantly I'm like you need to remove myself from checking the chart and everything like that in the domain over tonight So the domain should be officially switched tonight. 

I know that some people have been messaging me saying hey Maybe we should do a different type of name basically from other parties and other people Involved FJB coin org has been the unanimous decision, which I really love. I really love that URL because One I love the FJB an ocean and to a dot org is fucking perfect because dot orgs really show you and show how strong of a website it is and So FJB dot org probably pretty hard to get but FJB coin That org is probably fucking great I Love I love the org part. It'll make more sense when the news comes out. 

So I've been there FJB gov imagine but Yeah, I love you guys remember this but if you guys like try to get to I think it was Biden's campaign page but if you like put something in wrong Trump redirected it to like one of his pages and he put like a he just put like a Patrol page on there and it was fucking hilarious. But I think we tried FJB dot org and I don't I don't think it was available I think was a shit ton of money There's some domains that were like ridiculous and I know some people own some of the domains that are in here But FJB. Oh, yeah trolling Hillary. 

That's what it was but Yeah, so so the if you guys haven't seen it check out on Check out the website. It's great. That's it. 

That's the it appears you're as lost as me Take take a look at Take a look at the website when you get a chance new color scheme to The people that are doing the site are doing a fucking great job. Love the new color scheme Looks really clean looks really tight that red white and blue fucking beautiful The new logo is has that white background which looks really fucking awesome, which I love So if you guys have seen it Yeah, some people are saying it looks great. So this is so for example, like what are we? What are we working on? I'll give you a little insight. 

I gave some people some insight before we were trying to make it part of the rollout, but it's There's so many more steps than like a white bit or a XT on we're working on XT And wipe it still it's like yeah, it's getting so old It's just like talking to them is so difficult and try to figure everything out And then I if you I don't know if you guys have used that the chat on XT comm but they make me use the chat I'm like motherfucker. Like we listed a coin with you guys. Like why why are we going through with this? So So for example, like XT is such a pain We should be everything all trading is great on that all the trading works It's just the deposit and withdraw has been acting so funky and for example, I can't even withdraw my own Bitcoin from there I have Bitcoin in there that can't even withdraw so I'm getting fucked too on that end and I'm like, dude I have like five thousand dollars in Bitcoin that I can't even take out that's been stuck in there for weeks now And XT just been a pain. 

It's really clean. It's a really great exchange, but it's been a pain in the ass wipe it it's a work slower than like the Sloth and monsters University that's in the library. So they work slow as hell But uh, what else what else are we working on in terms of exchanges? Big boy the big daddy the Super Bowl of there it is.
