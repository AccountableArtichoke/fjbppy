I checked Transact's website earlier today and I couldn't find Juno. Is Juno live with them? No, I don't believe so.

Not to my knowledge, because they ensured us that they'd let us know when it was live. And I believe it was as recent as the last week that they said they were still testing. Any other questions?

So to recap, we had the Transact, we're all paid up with the Transact FJB fee that you all get charged when you purchase from Transact. So the way they do it is they pay you, it's a bucket that fills up at 500 bucks, they'll go ahead and do a payout. We were right under that at 460 something I believe, but they did go ahead and send us that payment.

So we're all up to date until December, caught up, and then now it'll be every $500 chunks, they'll go ahead and send us that payment. So that's wonderful. We'll be in or I'll be in Houston for March.

So we'll definitely do some FJB related events there, March 12 to the 17th. If you're in the area or have a business in the area, or know a business in the area or any kind of events, let us know. But that gives us a little bit of time for planning, which is great.

Our website is up to date, thanks to Dogbone, you shouldn't be getting that security alert any longer. I think it was just an expired certificate. Let's see what other questions that we have.

Velo is not currently working on anything for us. The only devs working on something actively are the gift card devs. And I believe that should be very close to completion.

I know Bess is, again, very, very thorough. They just want to make sure everything's great as they're testing. As far as the LP, it has not been locked.

Because the team is still reviewing that Venus for getting a loan against the LP. I think that would be very beneficial for us right now. But I will update you as soon as I get an update on that.

We did have a call today with the attorney and Boris's assistant, but it was regarding other things that I hope to update you on soon. It was not regarding the LP or re-locking the LP. Oh, and then as far as thank you for your patience for what's happening with the Transact today, it's a known issue.

They've been working on it. I think we just figured it out here in the last 30 minutes. I think they're using a new wallet to try to fill up and that new wallet is not whitelisted.

So I'm waiting for them to get back to me right now because they sent me the screenshots and it looked like their transactions weren't going through because they're taxed. So I asked them if they're using a new wallet to refill and surely enough they are. So we're waiting on that confirmation from them.

As soon as we get that wallet whitelisted, they should be good to go. They did say they have a few orders waiting. So again, appreciate your patience on that.

We don't have an amount for the amount that we're looking to get for the loan yet. I think at this stage they're still trying to decide if this is in the best interest of the coin and you, the holders, and then once that's decided then we'll move on to the amount. I am asking everybody for a huge favor.

If you know any influencers, micro influencers, really any business, anybody you know that would be great for us and be willing to endorse us, please reach out to me. Either DM me, email, or just tag me so we can reach out to them. We are looking for some new folks to endorse us.

Perry says to take out 200k worth of BNB and deposit it in his wallet. Oh okay, sure, we'll do that. But you just said you're new to the coin.

Is that your welcome gift? What's your fee? For what?

You're gonna endorse us? Perry says it's his fee so he doesn't get buyer's remorse. Oh and I should, I already answered this but again not before I hit record.

The question, the only questions I did get was could you elaborate on the details of how the fees being collected from Transact, the FJB fee, as well as other income sources like the contracts built in tax and merch sales is going to be put towards the LP. So as we mentioned earlier, as I mentioned earlier in the call, the fees being collected from Transact, those went straight to our marketing wallet. $465, I believe it was.

What did I say? $466.86. That'll be going towards bills for the time being. And then last time I checked on merch, we still had not broken even because of the fees with Shopify.

We had a yearly fee, I believe of $300. We had another fee of a Discord member to make us a few of the logos. Yeah.

And the contracts bill in tax, right now again that's all going to the marketing wallet. Once we decide what direction we're taking with the LP, we'll go ahead and change that tax to the new tax structure that we announced a few weeks ago and then can share more details then. Is the $500 going to the correct marketing wallet?

We have changed wallets in the last four. Yes, they actually did that manually. So they sent it as stablecoin.

And they did send us a transaction hash. Let me see. But yes.

Let's see if we can even check it. But yeah, it's done manually. So should be all good.

Basically, they hold on to it until it's $500. Then they ask you, okay, where do you want it to go? So no worries there.

Oh, yeah. So it looks like they sent it. Yep.

There it is in the TUSD. TUSD.

[Speaker 2]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
Is that you buying $200,000 worth of FGB? Don't be a party pooper. Dune.

I don't doubt it, Violets. That's all the pillows we have here. I do need a new robe though.

I was very heartbroken. My rope, like somehow, my favorite one, somehow got like a cut. Like it looks like somebody cut through it with scissors.

So maybe I should check actually. See if they have one like it. Let's look.

Ooh, I get a free gift with my order. No thank you for now. Okay.

Where are your robes? I know he has robes. I thought he did.

Please tell me he has a waffle one. Oh, he doesn't have a waffle robe. No.

He has like warm robes. I'm in the desert. Oh, he doesn't have one.

Shoot. You guys, the most awkward, like I shouldn't say the most awkward thing, but today, this lady that, so I volunteer every Sunday at like a food bank. So this lady that comes in every week and is very, very sweetest lady ever, right?

And we've made like good friends. Well, she made me a cheesecake. So she insisted I meet her today.

Whatever. I went to meet her. She wanted to make me this cheesecake and she does make amazing cheesecake.

Well, then she was asking me for advice. She's like, I'm just venting to you. I'm so sorry.

And mind you, this lady's a bit older, like probably a lot older. Actually, I'd say, I don't know, fifties, like late fifties, late sixties or early sixties, maybe not old, just a lot older than me. So anyway, she goes, oh my gosh, I got to ask for your advice.

Cause she's always like, oh, you're so level headed. You're so kind, which I'm totally not. She's really the kindest person ever.

Right? Well, I'm like, yeah. What, what is it?

She's like, my doctor, my daughter said I should just mind my business. Um, but I'm going to ask you and see what you say. I'm like, okay.

She goes, well, I was listening to my neighbor last night and you know, gives me a ton of details, whatever. And she goes, and then they were talking, you know, he's a Trumper and he was, he was talking to his friends that were over and they were talking about the border and he goes, we should just shoot them all. And you know, I've been thinking about it and I've just, I can't get it out of my head and I'm thinking I should go confront him.

I'm like, well, people are crazy on either end. So I don't know if I'd confront him. I'd probably listen to your daughter.

Cause you're probably just going to upset yourself like even more, right? Like I'm not defending him, but there's no reason to upset yourself. You guys aren't going to see eye to eye.

Well, it's funny. She keeps venting and she keeps saying like, I'm just venting. Thank you for listening to me.

And I'm listening, but she keeps going on with like, and he's a Trumper and he's, can you believe it? I can't believe it. And then he said that, uh, something she was going to drag show or something.

And he said they were a pedophiles. She keeps going, going, going. And so finally she's saying bye to me and she brings up again.

Can you believe though? So you really shouldn't, I shouldn't say anything to him. I'm like, no, I just for your own peace of mind, right?

Like you're just going to get more upset, I think. And she goes, but can you just believe, I mean, he still supports Trump. And so finally this whole time I'd like, you know, I just listened, but finally I felt like I had to tell her.

So I'm like, yeah, but we're not, you know, we're not all bad just because he's crazy. And he said that because, because I, I'm definitely a Trump supporter. And she goes, what really?

Like you still are. And I was like, yeah, it's just like, Oh, well, I really got to pick your brain some time. So I don't know.

I told you guys that story, but I thought I felt like I needed to tell someone. Um, but it's funny cause now she says she wants to pick my brain on something. So now I'm looking forward to that because I'm a Trumper and I still am.

And she still can't believe it. And her other neighbor, who's a woman, you know, and this guy has daughters, so she can't believe that he would support Trump. Did, did the inside trader special ed sign up change now and transact with his or full it.

So he's making money on everything. Uh, no, the transact, if you guys are talking about the FJB coin fee, um, I just answered that. Sorry if you missed it.

Um, we did get a payment for that for a little over $466 from this point forward, when that bucket fills up to 500, they'll go ahead and ask us which wallet, uh, it is to go to, which is going to our marketing wallet and they will, uh, deposit it in stable coin. Uh, change now has not gotten back to me yet. Once they do, I will for sure update you on that too, but I don't, I believe the way, seeming like the way they do it, um, is once that fills up, you either need to ask for it or they deposit it into, uh, your wallet.

Once it gets to a certain amount. Ooh, is Bed Bath and Beyond still closing stores? Those damn Trumpers.

Yeah. Right. I really can't wait to have a conversation with her though, because she does seem like she's somebody who'd actually listen.

Um, because a few of other, well, I have one, I shouldn't say a few, like one other friend I have well, and my mother-in-law, my mother-in-law and I, uh, literally can't even be in the same room anymore or speak because of that. Um, but I have a really, really good friend and, um, yeah, we can't talk about it because last time we spoke about it, which was the only time we spoke about it, he literally started like screaming and crying, literally crying. Um, because again, he can't, and all I was saying was facts.

I didn't say anything hurtful. I didn't get personal. I didn't do personal attacks.

Um, but he started screaming and crying and then he literally ran out and then came back like 15 minutes later, maybe. Uh, did you cover if Velo is working on the wallet? Uh, not currently.

No, the only devs we have working for us right now actively are the two devs on the gift cards. Just because we have so little funds, um, we, we need the, some income coming in, which we hope will happen once we get the gift cards and we can do in-person events. Very excited for that.

I miss, um, I miss a lot of folks who we haven't seen in the chats that I have no doubt will come back once we get moving. Perry, you did that? What?

But please do reach out to me, um, with anybody that you think would be great at endorsing us or any events. Maybe that's what I'll do on the announcement. Any events, um, you guys know of and any either individuals or businesses.

Trump. Yeah. Natalie Winters.

I like that. She's hot. Ooh, actually, was she really on Bannon today?

I didn't realize she was that big cause I thought, or I was pretty sure she's a local. Let me see. I could have sworn she was.

I didn't know she was that big to be on Bannon though. Cause we've looked at her before. We'll definitely reach out.

Yeah, I could have sworn. Trying to remember when. I don't think she ever posted something for us.

No idea who they are. What? Do you get on social media?

Probably better don't get on social media, honestly. But nowadays it's like where I get most of my news from. Owen Schroer as Cordessa's supporter.

I don't think he was on our official list. Right. It's been so long.

I was actually just talking about that a little bit ago, but it's been so long that I forget everybody who we had on board. I mean, we've literally even had Benny Johnson.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, they actually just spoke to Finman today. I'm going to drink so much freaking water with this drink. Oh my God.

Okay. Wow. That's a list.

Let me forward that to my saved one. Thank you, Heath. I saved that too.

Cause I can't think of. You guys are wild. Wild, wild.

I've got to say I've never owned a Lambo. Right, Heath? What else?

Any other questions? All right. Well, I think that's it then.

That's all the updates I have. So as always, feel free to DM me or tag me if you have any questions. I'm hoping we get this Transact issue figured out here shortly.

I'm waiting on them to reply. And that's where it looks like they read my message. As soon as they reply and we get that whitelisted, we should be back on track.

Yeah. But that's it. That's all the updates we have for now.

I'll see you on Friday on Discord as usual. Hopefully we have a few more updates then. But yeah, I can't wait.

Hopefully B&B keeps going. But thank you all for joining. I hope you have a wonderful night.
