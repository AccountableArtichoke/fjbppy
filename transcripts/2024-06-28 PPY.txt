(0:01 - 0:37)
So, some of you have seen the kind of final videos, final for the most part, minus like probably to video and audio people would probably notice the new changes. But we had several pages post the video, which went pretty well. I was just looking, it looks like we got several thousand plays on that, which is awesome.

(0:38 - 1:02)
And I know that doesn't, sometimes that doesn't seem like a lot because, well, they didn't convert into buys. But a lot of these people, it's going to take, you know, brand recognition for them to see it a few times. I think the average, last time I checked it, my stats may be off because it's been so long.

(1:02 - 1:19)
But I think it takes the average person seeing something like six or seven times before they actually buy it or spend money on it or download it or join it. So I think it actually went pretty well. We got the majority.

(1:19 - 1:42)
Well, what we could take from it is that our web traffic definitely went up quite a bit. We've been the daily traffic we've been getting daily is usually what we get in like an entire week. Some of the days are what we've gotten in over a week.

(1:42 - 1:54)
So that's good. People are checking it out. Looks like the FAQ on our website is the most visited page.

(1:55 - 2:08)
So we'll definitely get more questions added there and kind of clean it up this weekend. We also had some mass texts sent out. Actually, those happened before the video.

(2:08 - 2:22)
I believe it was the night before we got some really good traction. We actually didn't send them out till pretty late. I think our time is around dinner time on the West Coast.

(2:22 - 2:36)
And we got some pretty good traction again on the website. So and we can see the stats for those. I think we sent out 10,000 texts.

(2:37 - 3:21)
We buy them in packages and then we send out like a little bit at a time just to kind of test little areas. And again, since we're just beginning, we don't want to go too hard. We did. 

It was awesome because we caught some website bugs that Dog Bone worked actually really hard to fix right away. So that's exactly why we're doing what we're doing. Yeah, from the Instagram from the Instagram reels that were shared on Instagram and Facebook, I want to say it was about a dozen accounts off the top of my head.

(3:22 - 3:38)
We also worked out a few bugs from there, not only on Instagram, but again on the website and app. So we've pushed through all the updates from our end. And again, we'll continue to do this.

(3:38 - 4:04)
I'm sure with the more users we have and the more traffic we have, the more bugs we'll catch and we'll be able to fix that. So we don't run into some big crash where it turns into an unpleasant experience for users. What else? As far as that goes, we'll send out we won't be doing any promos during the weekend.

(4:04 - 4:21)
One, they really generally people aren't on their phones on the weekend, you know, especially conservatives are doing family stuff, too. It's a Fourth of July weekend. So people will definitely be out or with family or what have you.

(4:22 - 4:37)
Next week, we'll definitely have some promos. I believe we're going to start two influencers. So that's going to be awesome.

(4:37 - 4:52)
Super excited for that. I think this will be great for us. And again, it'll be a good start to kind of see what fixes we need, what bugs more users, you know, find.

(4:54 - 5:06)
So excited for that. Getting some stuff ready for them. That's what I've been working on mainly actually today.

(5:09 - 5:18)
Yeah, we will do voice chats next week will be a little bit different. So I can't do. We'll do.

(5:19 - 5:27)
Let's see. Let's look at the calendar. So we'll do Thursday instead of Friday, I think.

(5:29 - 5:48)
Unless you guys just want a recorded one, then I can do Friday. But otherwise, I think we'll do Thursday night and. Fourth is on Tuesday.

(5:49 - 5:55)
And then I don't know. You guys can pick whether you want Monday. I guess Monday there won't be really updates like now.

(5:55 - 6:05)
So maybe Tuesday would be a good one. Because then it would be weird to do Wednesday or Thursday. So whatever you guys decide, we'll do.

(6:05 - 6:08)
So we'll probably do Tuesday. We'll stay the same. That seems fine.

(6:09 - 6:14)
I'll just make sure to record. Oh, shoot. This is June.

(6:16 - 6:20)
OK. Tuesday, second. OK.

(6:21 - 6:27)
Hmm. OK, that's Thursday's the fourth. So we'll do Thursday for sure.

(6:27 - 6:33)
So I guess the question is whether we'll do one in between now and Thursday. Up to you guys. You guys decide.

(6:33 - 6:43)
Let me know. I think Monday will be too soon because we're not running anything during the weekend. Yeah.

(6:44 - 6:56)
Do most of you have the fourth off or are you just getting Monday off? It's not working out for any of it. With all of you with real jobs. Yeah.

(6:56 - 7:05)
So we'll do Thursday for sure. And then you guys decide on if you want one in between there. I just can't do Friday.

(7:08 - 7:19)
Yeah. The chat. You should have seen.

(7:20 - 7:32)
You may have noticed some updates in the app. The devs have been working pretty dang hard. I think two of the devs are taking the weekend off.

(7:32 - 7:43)
I think we'll have one working through the weekend for. Let's see. What are we working on? The announcements are done.

(7:43 - 7:58)
As you see. Bugs orders page and refactoring is complete. Actually, let me.

(8:36 - 8:49)
What else we got? Yeah. So the orders page, I believe, should be done by end of day. Still early for our West Coast dev.

(8:51 - 9:07)
What was I going to say with that? Oh, some other bugs you guys are experiencing. So one is the price difference on the app versus the live versus the chart. That's just discrepancy.

(9:07 - 9:19)
And really, like, timing has one hasn't updated and the other has. So those will, for the most part, they'll match. But it's pretty slight difference.

(9:20 - 9:33)
And then for your off ramping. When you go to withdraw, some of you or all of you are seeing a bug. And that's actually an on ramper bug.

(9:34 - 9:42)
They're actively working on that. So as soon as they actually fix that, that'll be fixed on our end. Yeah.

(9:46 - 10:18)
Other than that, I think everything should be good in the I know. I think one I was going to say a few of you, but I think was one person that was having issues buying on quick swap this morning, getting good liquidity, no liquidity message or something like that. Just remember, sometimes, even though you might use your VPN every time and it's worked, sometimes it's usually the VPN when you get that error.

(10:19 - 10:26)
So make sure to test turning that off. Sometimes that's weird. I don't know why mine does that, too.

(10:29 - 10:43)
OK, let me jumping jacks. Oh, nice. Thank you.

(10:44 - 10:51)
The people doing his thing. Also, can't wait to see that video. Oh, the video is.

(10:52 - 11:05)
Did I already say that? I think I already did. The we have the final, final, final video. So we'll post that maybe on the fourth.

(11:09 - 11:17)
For those messages, I was looking at June calendar. I have the fourth off till Monday. Nice.

(11:21 - 11:34)
Thursday and Friday off. Nice. Educational videos have taken a backseat because we decided to take, I think, on the next quarter is where I believe it was.

(11:34 - 11:40)
The marketplace. So. That's taken.

(11:40 - 11:48)
We have the one working on. The admin pages still for that. So.

(11:49 - 12:01)
So you guys have seen the education marketplace have been hidden. Marketplace will very likely pop up first. Yeah.

(12:01 - 12:10)
And then now that our video is. 100 percent finalized. Our video.

(12:11 - 12:38)
Guy will go back to the educational videos and then some graphics. Brandon getting destroyed in almost every headline this morning. Yeah.

(12:39 - 13:55)
Seems a little staged. Shoot. What else? Oh, with the influencers next week.

(13:56 - 14:26)
I think we're going to try to. We're going to try to get. Oh, for the influencers next week.

(14:27 - 14:38)
We'll try to get the smaller influencer first. Definitely to post first. By try.

(14:38 - 14:58)
I mean, we will that way again, just in case there's any bugs, which I'm sure there will be. We'll figure them out first and then we'll probably have our influencer with like half a million followers go next. Yeah.

(14:59 - 15:50)
And again, we'll just. See how that goes from there. Pretty good.

(15:51 - 16:02)
Let's look at. Dude, June. Looking too shabby.

(16:04 - 16:51)
That's the graph for the. Web traffic. Nice.

(16:56 - 17:08)
I think June 22nd is when. We were doing some super chats. On YouTube and then.

(17:10 - 17:17)
Rumble. I think we did like right under. Three hours.

(17:25 - 17:40)
So that'll be nice to see that. With time. Oh, I actually meant to send Finn the final video.

(17:40 - 17:44)
I need to do that. It's the weekend now. It's probably busy, but.

(17:45 - 17:56)
Do it next week. It's hot and humid all of a sudden. Phoenix has never been humid ever.

(18:02 - 18:04)
That's awful. Next week. Nice.

(18:07 - 18:12)
Enjoy. How's the marketplace? Come along. Awesome.

(18:14 - 18:22)
Getting ready for. The admin capabilities to make all the changes there. That'll be cool.

(18:30 - 18:41)
At the end of the video that was released. Anna spoke of his support for PPI. Was that something new or pulled from War Room? We pulled that.

(18:43 - 18:56)
Any hints on who the influencers are? They're on Instagram. I think the first one has. I think right over.

(18:57 - 19:07)
Let's say 120 something. If I'm thinking of the correct one off the top of my head. Let me see.

(19:08 - 19:31)
Let me check. No, that one was that one has 80 thousand. Yeah, so we'll definitely have her go first.

(19:32 - 19:55)
Right over 80 thousand followers. Very pretty lady. The gentleman has right under 500 thousand followers.

(19:56 - 20:06)
Both with very, very high engagement. So that'll be awesome. Hopefully.

(20:12 - 20:27)
When are we going to promote political donations heavy? No, as soon as we get the app solid. And by that, I don't mean I know we've been working on it for so long. And you guys have tested it, but we definitely want to get.

(20:29 - 20:48)
Some more people testing it other than the 200 and some users we have. So like we have we have right under a few hundred regular app users. This is talking active every month.

(20:50 - 21:02)
Which is great. That's definitely not all of our holders by far. That's just you all who log in there like 10 times a day.

(21:05 - 21:15)
So once we get some new users, see if they're having any issues. See if there's things we need to that they're confused by. Because you've all been using the app for so long.

(21:16 - 21:31)
Any additions we need to make to and then we'll go from there. I think July June has been wonderful. I think July will be great for we'll continue with the.

(21:32 - 21:51)
Mass texts will. Continue with the influencers. And then we'll have some advertising on some networks and some pretty big email lists.

(21:52 - 22:07)
Depending on how that all goes, we'll see. About the. Podcaster slots if we're ready for that by end of month or.

(22:10 - 22:20)
Or not. It's pretty awesome though. Finally having a super solid team and solid devs.

(22:21 - 22:36)
Now that like the third party issues and change now and all that has been worked out. All the recent changes have been more like very just trying to automate everything. Example being like the change now.

(22:39 - 22:54)
So that's nice. Are there candidates ready to be added to the app? Yes. That'll be again with the admin features.

(22:55 - 23:05)
Is end of month now July end of July? No, the. Promises we made were made with end of June. Unless you haven't been paying attention.

(23:07 - 23:46)
Bring my succulents here. I saw what they're doing. Steve.

(23:55 - 24:07)
We got wrapped in on board. We're trying. For sure trying.

(24:08 - 25:05)
The more the more controversial the better. Make make the liberals lose their minds. Are we still going to burn tokens? That answer has not changed from the last like hundred times.

(25:05 - 25:27)
I've answered it. Robert 308 on discord asks. Looks like everybody is done with best.

(25:28 - 25:36)
Best is no more. So moving on. She did not get your tokens.

(25:37 - 25:49)
They're off there. I think the education section will be awesome for you. And I think that'll be awesome for a lot of people.

(25:49 - 26:09)
I think that'll be definitely a very valuable. Definitely say that being super, super, super easy is probably the number one. Most valuable thing.

(26:15 - 26:26)
Education comes pretty close. Bye bye. Just don't let the door kick you on the way out.

(26:27 - 26:33)
I haven't heard. I haven't gotten one complaint for magic yet. So I think you guys are good with it.

(26:33 - 26:42)
I don't think it can get much worse. Much better. Our old sign.

(26:45 - 26:53)
I think I know it's sometimes it's annoying. I get it. But I think that's also because I'm signing in so many times a day.

(26:54 - 27:05)
Again, we've thought about adding the text. Text you a code. Originally magic themselves.

(27:05 - 27:23)
Highly discouraged from having that as an option or as the main option. So we'll revisit that. I'm sure as they're constantly evolving and constantly as technology is constantly evolving to.

(27:24 - 27:39)
Help make specific things more secure. We'll see if we can eventually get that added. But I think for the best interest of everybody and everybody's security is.

(27:41 - 27:52)
Good idea to keep that. It's also I don't know if you guys have noticed this also with reconfiguring everything. It's also been really good.

(27:52 - 28:07)
The app about keeping you signed on. About keeping your off. So if you sign in and then leave and come back and sign in again.

(28:07 - 28:20)
If you're still under specific time, it's letting you sign in without a code again. So definitely make sure that your email has a 2FA on it. So it's secure.

(28:20 - 28:35)
You definitely don't want to then lose your funds because of how easy it is and somebody getting access to your email. That's what I would do. At least is just put 2FA on your email.

(28:37 - 28:54)
Are you releasing the finalized version of the video tonight? I was planning to wait till next week. But if you guys would prefer it tonight, we can do that. And again, it's pretty unless you're.

(29:03 - 29:15)
Yeah, so unless it'll be more like. I don't know if you guys will notice the changes, but I can definitely post it tonight. If you guys want it tonight.

(29:18 - 29:30)
You'll notice. If you're in my opinion, if you're a pro, you'll notice the coloring and sound changes. But otherwise, to the naked eye, it'll probably.

(29:33 - 30:38)
Probably won't notice a huge difference. Robert 308. That's the case.

(30:39 - 31:39)
Then let me download it. P.P.Y. Launch hype video version 5. Oh, we also actually have to probably be next week. Let me see.

(31:40 - 32:19)
I just saw a pop up from their account and it reminded me. Let me see. Your likes are now private on Twitter.

(32:19 - 33:07)
Really? I think that's because people weren't people getting fired for her post. They liked wild. I'm going to hit us up.

(33:07 - 33:58)
Let's check this page. The first legit DM we've gotten for somebody to want to collaborate with us. OK, check them out.

(33:59 - 34:12)
One point one million followers. Let's see if they're real. This is how I get sidetracked.

(34:13 - 37:12)
It's all Patriot Pay stuff, but this is how I go into doing like 20 different things at a time. I went into Twitter to check on a DM. Can you provide Steve with some P.P.Y. swag so he can bring it with him on Monday? Oh boy.

(37:14 - 38:25)
Some P.P.Y. gift cards. Are we still using the marketing company? Yes. We are.

(39:01 - 39:17)
Is that everything? Starting to get more and more DMs now. Bumper stickers. We can send Steve some.

(39:17 - 39:39)
He can sign them for folks in there. Yeah, interesting to see what they'll have in the theater that the left is putting on. OK, guys, well, I think that's everything I got.

(39:39 - 39:49)
We'll plan on voice chat Thursday. We'll see. It's up to you guys if you want to do one Tuesday.

(39:49 - 39:59)
I feel like that's very soon, Tuesday and Thursday, but up to you. We'll see. We could play it out by ear and see if we have a lot of updates.

(40:01 - 40:13)
Or not so much, depending on how busy you guys are with the 4th. If you need anything else, in the meantime, reach out. Again, please make sure that your accounts are secure.

(40:14 - 40:29)
Again, remember that we won't ever ask for your info. Also keep in mind that code that gets emailed to you now, that may as well be your seed phrase. Do not send me screenshots of that.

(40:31 - 40:47)
The app is pretty secure and intuitive. Obviously, even if you send me a screenshot and I go ahead and log in from a different IP, it should block it and ask to send a code again. But still, you don't want to get in the habit of that.

(40:47 - 41:09)
Just remember that code that gets emailed to you is just like when your bank emails you a code or texts you a code. So, please keep that in mind, just in case that happens to be the next scammer's thing. Definitely don't want anybody to be a first for that.

(41:10 - 41:29)
As usual, don't give anybody your private key. I would generally just not connect the wallet that my PPY is in to other, if you have it on MetaMask or TrustWallet, if you have other accounts. I would definitely just not get in the habit of connecting that to anything else you're doing.

(41:30 - 41:38)
Just open a new wallet. It doesn't cost you anything to open a new wallet. Send some funds there, if you need gas funds or anything like that, and call it a day.

(41:38 - 41:56)
Keep yourself secure. But I think that's everything is fine. Make it your mission this week to sign a friend on the app.

(41:56 - 42:09)
Send them 1776PPY to get started. Hey, that's a good idea, actually. Thursday alone is fine. 

Enjoy a little bleed. Thank you. Yes, I will post the video tonight.

(42:10 - 42:16)
Actually, I should have downloaded it by now. Yes, I did. Okay, cool.

(42:18 - 42:31)
I will post that. It's a pretty, I think it's a pretty awesome freaking video. So yeah, it'll be good.

(42:31 - 42:55)
We'll continue making some changes to socials this weekend just to get ready before the bigger influencer accounts again. If you just Instagram and Facebook or be because the way they're shadowing us, but we've had some pretty good accounts post our content. Let's see.

(42:57 - 43:19)
I think I didn't post the list, but let's go back to the first one. First one had 139,000 followers. Almost 2,000 views on that video.

(43:21 - 43:36)
And this is not like some. I mean, these accounts are actually followed by people, you know, in the space. These aren't some like bought accounts or anything like that.

(43:39 - 43:45)
Let's see. So that one. As I do on the next one, this one.

(43:47 - 43:54)
123,000 followers. Let's see. This one followed by again.

(43:55 - 44:11)
With some pretty big names and some pretty big and prominent business owners to if you keep up with that. This one had 26,000. That video had 300 views.

(44:11 - 44:23)
The one before it had how many? That one was also almost 2,000 views. So that's that's excellent news. And that's we had what in the past few days.

(44:23 - 44:33)
We've had 123456. Scrolling too fast. One, two, three, four, five, six.

(44:35 - 44:47)
Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. I think that's 12 accounts. This one had 94,000.

(44:48 - 45:01)
And how many views on that? Another over 2,000 views on that. So this is all. Great news.

(45:01 - 45:17)
Again, getting the brand out there and getting people to start seeing the brand. Trying to see who is followed by again. Followed by some big names on all of them.

(45:20 - 45:27)
Yeah. So to answer you again, MP. No, July is not or the end of the month is not July.

(45:27 - 45:35)
We have begun. I'd say we're combined. I have this written down.

(45:35 - 45:47)
I wrote down and calculated the stats yesterday for what we have so far. Let me check. Let me check.

(46:05 - 46:33)
Right under. So right under a million followers between those pages. Thank you, man.

(46:34 - 46:39)
Appreciate everyone in here. Yes. And appreciate you for all your hard work on the website.

(46:40 - 46:51)
It looks beautiful. I will get some epic cues. Done for that.

(46:52 - 46:59)
Does look super amazing. And clean. We the people will laugh at me for that.

(47:00 - 47:23)
Did we get many new wallets? We got a few wallets. But we didn't get a huge uptick in from our usual new wallets per day. We got definitely heavier website traffic that I posted earlier.

(47:23 - 47:52)
But as far as wallets, we got we got definitely got some new wallets. Just not a whole lot from both the text and the. I actually haven't calculated out, but I'm looking here.

(47:52 - 48:06)
I was I've been just checking at multiple times a day, and it's definitely a few more per day than normal. But that's about it. But people are looking at the website.

(48:06 - 48:30)
So they've seen it on all these, like, super, super, very. Like meme pages, conservative, definitely. So now I think once influencers personally start talking about it, I think there's a lot there with marketing psychology that, you know, you can see an ad.

(48:30 - 48:38)
Kind of like I'll see ad on pop up on my Instagram or on my Facebook. I don't know if it's an ad like a paid app. I will scroll by it.

(48:38 - 48:58)
There's no way I'm looking at that. But if somebody I like that's talking about something that I'm definitely more willing to listen and trust what they're saying. So, yeah, I think it's definitely a huge win for our first week with the mass texting.

(49:01 - 49:15)
The Instagrams, the even the actually even the super chats gave us some great website traffic. I get people talking about it. That's the first step.

(49:15 - 49:27)
Right. And then again, in the meantime, we worked out some. Errors on our end and things that have popped up.

(49:29 - 49:35)
Example being for the website. We definitely don't want another wire day. We definitely.

(49:37 - 49:51)
Again, that was that was Steve's one request. So we're keeping to that, that everything needs to be. Done correctly.

(49:54 - 50:04)
So I think now that's everything. Contest. Oh, let's see.

(50:04 - 50:18)
What do you guys want to do? Trying to think of. Let me think of a contest. We could just do a buy buying contest, but.

(50:19 - 50:32)
I feel like we should do something more fun. Or something that will help get the word out. Yeah, let me give me a bit and then I'll post that.

(50:32 - 50:45)
Let's do something that involves. That involves some new wallets. How about that? Maybe we can incorporate dog bones idea of sending somebody 1776.

(50:47 - 50:55)
So I think that's a good idea, actually. And then we'll get new wallets. OK, how about let's do that? Let's do contest.

(50:57 - 51:10)
Is. You guys asking your friends or anybody you follow to go ahead and sign up in the app, which they're not going to have the same issue now that they did before, because all they need to do. So one click sign up.

(51:10 - 51:22)
Make sure you tell them to. So I've noticed actually. And this is what's great about this is I've noticed when we say download app, I think that and I get this because I'm the same way.

(51:22 - 51:28)
And many of you are probably the same way. If somebody tells you download an app, you're probably like, no way. Like, I have so many apps on my phone.

(51:29 - 51:53)
I actually I need to clean out my phone of apps. So I think it's really important to mention or tell people they could just visit the app dot Patriot pay that work. We don't necessarily need people to download the app as long as they're signing up for account and getting in there because, you know, people aren't obsessed like we are very like diehard.

(51:53 - 52:04)
They don't want another app. But guess what? The browser on your phone works just as well. It's pretty much the same exact thing, and it works beautifully.

(52:05 - 52:19)
A lot of times, if you're like on a Web site, it's a lot more complicated than the app and the app is just a lot easier to navigate. I don't think that really holds true for our app. The Web app is really super easy.

(52:19 - 52:44)
So let's do the contest. You messaging, putting on social media, texting your friend, whatever the link. You could just give them the link, the app dot Patriot pay that work instead of WWW is just app APP and tell them to just sign in there and give you their wallet address and send them 1776.

(52:44 - 53:08)
So then the contest will be everybody that sends a 1776 will be entered in the contest and we'll do. Let's see. Let me get I'll write the I'll write the rules because it'll be different than all the other ones.

(53:09 - 53:23)
And again, the 1776 that is almost nothing. Yeah. How much do we send them? Oh, that's a good question.

(53:24 - 53:48)
Let me see. Let's see. Give me a calculator.

(53:53 - 54:49)
Let's do should be 1930.43. Okay, so I think we'll do that. So the more wallets you sign up. I think that's a good idea, right? So either way, however, you guys want to do it.

(54:49 - 55:38)
It can show up however you guys want to do it. Be a force multiplier this week. Yes.

(55:39 - 55:51)
Yeah, either way, because if you send 1776, that'll be cool because it shows up on the block. Well, wait, I'm not sure. I'll have to check that.

(55:52 - 56:00)
Is it going to show up as 1776? I think it should actually. And then under transactions. Excuse me.

(56:01 - 56:12)
So either way, if you want to do it so that you send the 1776 or you want to do it so they receive 1776. Either way will work. But I think that's a pretty good contest.

(56:13 - 56:40)
And the more people you send to again. Be honest, don't make up some, you know, make up some weird. Well, we'll make sure actually for this one that the that the winner is a user in the chat.

(56:40 - 56:50)
That'll be one of the terms. So we're not going to send the prize to a random wallet. We'll make sure that.

(56:52 - 57:05)
It is a known user in the chat, so that's going to be one of the terms. How about that? And if your wallet is anonymous, you don't need to be. You don't need to dox your wallet.

(57:05 - 57:20)
You can, you know, you can make a new wallet and you can purchase 20 bucks of PQI that you want to send to people. So that's you don't have to do that. You can keep your wallets anonymous if you like to do that.

(57:23 - 57:41)
So, yeah, if you, you know, you can do that if you want to keep your wallets anonymous, since the contest does have to be to a user in here. You can just start a new wallet. You can buy 10 bucks of PQI or 20 bucks of PQI that you are going to send to people to enter the contest, if you like.

(57:41 - 58:02)
But I think that's a pretty good contest, like Dogbone said, to be a force multiplier, get some signups, get some people addicted, let them know they don't have to download the app. People hate that, you know, again, app.patriotpay.org and they can do everything there just as easy. It's very easy to navigate in the browser.

(58:05 - 58:18)
So, yeah, sending into the app from Trust Wallet is fine. Yes. That works.

(58:19 - 58:24)
OK. I think that's everything. Oh, Dogbones made a good point.

(58:25 - 58:51)
8000 PQI minimum transfer. How about any transfer you make to an app wallet, as long as it's not yours? If you're getting friends to open an account, have them open an account and transfer whatever, if you want to give them, you know, whatever you want to transfer them. 8000 is small enough still, so.

(58:53 - 59:07)
Let's see, what is 8000? That's about two bucks, three bucks. So you guys would be like around 280. So that's awesome.

(59:07 - 59:19)
It's not going to. It's not going to hit your wallet too hard, but I think that's a good contest. Yeah, I will let you guys know if I have any updates this weekend.

(59:19 - 59:35)
You should have gotten a little pop up in your app now. I think this will be an awesome feature to use for announcements. Because for the people that don't check in much, I guess that kind of defeats the purpose, too.

(59:35 - 59:43)
But yeah, I think that'll be good for updates, too. For those of you that don't check the chats, that way you don't have to check the chats. You don't have to check social media.

(59:43 - 1:00:01)
We are going to make try to make it so that really most everything we need in our community is in the app. We have our one dev working on the. Gamification of the app, which should be really, really cool.

(1:00:02 - 1:00:14)
He's the one working this weekend, so. OK, I'm going to get off because I keep sharing stuff with you guys. You all have a safe weekend.

(1:00:14 - 1:00:25)
If you're. Doing anything fun, I will be here if you need anything else. I will post both recordings again.

(1:00:25 - 1:00:36)
I'm not going to have notes for Tuesdays because I honestly don't remember everything we discussed. I will put some notes for this one and I'll see you guys in the chat. Thank you.
