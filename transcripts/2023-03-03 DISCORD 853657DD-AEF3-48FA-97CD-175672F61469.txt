[Speaker 1]
Hello, happy Friday. Can you all hear me? Awesome, anything happen yet?

Um, James, James can still hear us if he wants to. He's still, you know, that's what the gulag's for, egg. Well, happy Friday.

I got my decaf coffee. I'm gonna stop eating this cake. I just wanted to get on.

I don't have any really big updates, but I wanted to get on in case anybody had any questions that I could answer. We're still waiting on really the biggest thing. I think it'll be the biggest update that we've had, gosh, probably since B&B took over.

So I think it'll be super exciting, and I think it'll be for the best interest of the coin and the community. I think everybody will be very pleased. I can't wait to share that with you, and I will as soon as I'm able to.

Other than that, Egghead says, when please us? As soon as I can. I think, I think that date will please everybody.

Day, month, year. It'll, I think it'll definitely be within the, everything will be completed by quarter one. Unless B&B decide not to, but that's the plan.

Any update on getting everything in writing? No, we have not gotten it in writing. I'm sorry, give me just a second.

Okay, but yes, everything's looking really good. Flute, I feel like I have to say that disclaimer, because I am not, I don't call the shots. So that's the plan.

Can you tell them, Egg said not, to not, not to. Yes, I don't think we'll have a problem with that. Will we get a clear roadmap?

Yes, as soon, once this takes place, and once this is all in writing and approved, everything should come very smoothly after that. I'm sorry, I just can't say too much without really giving away anything. But we did say before the end of the year, and then we were waiting for certain commitments from B&B so we don't run into, you know, we don't have them on voice, and then we have an issue with just timing and them being so busy.

I did promise you guys that we are getting them to get something scheduled on a more regular basis so we don't run into this problem again. And that's exactly what we're doing. And they have agreed on everything.

And everything's going really well. Why did you panic sell? Again, I've answered this many times before, including in my post, I did not panic sell.

This was a decision that was made with a lot of time. And it was so I could have funds readily available to put in the project because I was not willing to keep putting in money straight from my bank account. So I've answered that plenty of times.

I'm sorry if you guys don't believe it. That's the truth. And it's not going to change.

My answer is not going to change. Weg, we're not starting over. It's being recorded, you can listen to the recording.

You haven't missed much, but welcome. Um, I think telegram has mentioned a fork, we can look into that into the future. But I think you all will be very pleased with the changes that are in the works right now.

And it'll be it'll be really big. What are we waiting for to be completed? We're waiting to get everything in writing and agreed upon by BNB.

So did you buy back in? No, I have not bought back in. Maybe time to have been an Epstein they're overdue.

That would be respect for the community. Yeah, I think, you know, that's kind of their war room shout outs. Several of them now I haven't kept track.

I'm sure somebody has. I think that was, you know, they're proving to everybody that they are still here. And more committed than they have been in the past.

I think that's really the most they've mentioned us on war room since they, you know, acquired FJB. So, but we will still try to get them in. One reply to DMs, Donnie.

How many developers do we currently have working on the project? We are negotiating pay with two different teams right now. If you're so confident, this will be great.

Why would you not buy back in? Again, goes back to the original statement. I need those funds and on right there in case we need them for funding for the project.

I do believe in the project and unless you guys would like to put those funds up again, it's sure. I sold my coins that I paid so much for, but at the end of the day, I think putting those funds and having them there in case I need them to pay bills was more important to me. And unfortunately, I can't share more of that.

That would make more sense. But again, that's the truth. We don't wipe the chats here.

We record everything. We record the voices and BNB know and can see everything. And that is the truth.

And they are very aware of that. And that's been repeated again and again. If that was not the truth, I would not be saying it, repeating it, putting up these voice calls that I know they and their teams listen to and read the chats.

Are there new owners or are BNB the owners? No, there are no new owners. Did we hear back from Newman?

No, we have not. Are you getting paid? No, I am not.

I'm here because I believe in the project. I am not getting paid. Oh, sorry.

Let's do that.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, sorry. Let's go back. So you're not getting paid and not holding.

I'm still holding some coins that I did not sell. Is the rebrand in the works? That's part of everything that's getting finalized.

What about funds and marketing wallets? What will those be used for? That will be shared with the community as it happens.

And obviously, paid to all the debts, too. FJB name is gold. Yes, it is.

However, when we haven't gotten approved for one event, that's a problem. When even my store and TPUSA don't want us, that's a problem. We just got to be smart about it.

Hi, Ronnie. Will the coin still be FJB? That is being decided on currently.

Okay. As far as the token, yes. As far as the app and all our branding, not sure.

Because a name change or token change would require a fork. We're actually Let's Go Brandon still. Have we made progress in recovering the missing funds?

Last we spoke, or I spoke to Boris about that was a phone call about, I want to say it's been exactly a week, actually. I believe seven days ago. And he said, yes, however, that's going to take a lot of time.

Please, for the love of God, don't look that up. What was I not looking up? Can't be worse than, well, what was it, Winston?

Or who was it that I looked up? No, I have to look it up. You can't say that.

Oh, my gosh. It doesn't even give me a definition. It gives me like, takes me right to X-rated sites.

What the heck is that? I'm not even gonna look at it. Oh, my gosh.

Does BNB want to stay with the BNB? Yes, I believe. Because anything that would move us off BNB would require a fork, I believe.

Pickle, yeah, it was Pickle Puffer, but I don't remember who, I want to say it was Winston. So is everything going to be finalized by the end of quarter one or longer? Quarter one, we should comfortably be, everything should be completed and finalized according to plan.

We are literally just waiting for BNB to get their written approval. Specifically said not to, well, yeah. Oh, yeah, I see it is Winston, pretty sure.

Will Bannon still FJB merch? I'm not sure, because there was supposed to be um, War Room merch coming out. Did that ever happen?

I know a bunch of people were talking about it, but I checked their site the other day, I didn't see it anywhere. Yes, today. Oh, the War Room?

I don't know if that was the answer to what I was asking, but oh, let's see, oh, I see it, CPAC, okay, cool. Let's look it up, I want to see it. I see some stuff, but that doesn't look like their official stuff.

Their official merch.

[Speaker 3]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Son of FJB, SFJB. Yeah, there were a lot of good ideas for rebranding the app, um, so, so are we launching end of quarter one, end of March? Um, we're hoping to do it as soon as possible, but again, just waiting for everything in writing, don't want to release anything to you early before it's finalized.

And devs, uh, should be very, let me check my email, actually. Estimate on how much time to fix the app, um, it should, I'm obviously not a dev, um, but it really shouldn't take much. I know in the past when it's been, when we've had the app malfunction, um, it's been just some small changes from either transact or change now.

Um, I know that was changed in the code, so we wouldn't run into that, uh, the app malfunctioning every time transact or change now change their minimums for transactions. Um, so I know that shouldn't be the issue now, um, but it really shouldn't be, uh, anything crazy long. I think that's, uh, the least of our worries.

Are we thinking of adding other on off-ramps like moonpay simplex? Um, I think transact is a little delayed with their off-ramp, um, but yeah, eventually I think that's definitely, um, something we'd like to add to the app along with other coins. What's the most of our worries?

Getting everything in writing, signed, and committed to. I think that's, uh, great. Getting our devs on board.

Um, and I wouldn't say it's just the most of our worries. I'd just say that's, um, I don't think the app is, is great. I think it's great.

Uh, previous dev said that too, uh, just again, with so many, you know, we have transact change now, there are just so many different variables going on where things can go wrong. Will we still be able to buy my pillow merch with FJB at some point? We're trying to get in the my store still and that's, um, why I think the rebranding, at least the app, is going to be great for us because then we can use that name for our merch, for an LLC to get us into events and get those gift cards going and be able to sell FJB to anybody.

Just, uh, in person, which is our target audience. Older people who are more likely to buy a $25 gift card using their card or cash in person versus going online, downloading an app, and, you know, uploading their driver's license or something like that. At least just to get the word out.

With older audience, abandon the app, must be fixed and smooth. Yes, absolutely. Uh, when is full-on launch of FJB?

Uh, that's a date we are trying to get, uh, finalized. Day one energy, Sarah. Yes, absolutely.

Um, I think, I think everybody will have day one energy once you all, uh, find out about the new updates. Is Vestfall a stumbling block or does that need removed? Another better option found.

Uh, Vestfall actually is very, it's a lot different now than when we first got the app. They have simplified it, um, and it's super, super easy now and very secure. I know it wasn't the easiest for us early users, but it's come a long way.

Now all you get is an email or an email from them, from Vest in your email, and you have to click on the link or get a code to enter into the app. Excuse me. So everyone's happy with it now.

Um, I, I haven't heard any complaints from folks who have used it, uh, after the changes took place. I think everybody who has kind of has a bad taste in their mouth from Vest is us original users who had a bit of trouble with it. I know it was very complicated back then.

Also the founders of the company are beyond amazing and willing to do whatever they can, uh, to make any changes that would help us out. They've done a ton for us, super awesome patriots. And, um, they're extra, extra cautious about the security and having different layers of securities where, uh, security, sorry, where, um, they have actually a lot of their stuff is patented, which is very, very important in case we get somebody, you know, trying to attack the app.

Are we selling tax wallet in small increments to avoid high dumps when bills needed to be paid? Yes. And we've, uh, are still doing like over the counter sales too.

Would you say thing that things have progressed from last week to now? Uh, yes, absolutely. I think we're getting very close with the devs, um, to at least get that app going, uh, while we wait on everything to get finalized.

Once we have that, um, I'm confident that everybody will be happy with the updates. When gift cards, um, so we actually have the gift cards completed. Like if you were to want to buy a gift card right now, I can send you a gift card.

Um, the issue is we are just waiting on a password that makes it much easier if people are purchasing it in person. Okay. So app will be worked on as soon as devs are contracted.

Yes, absolutely. Oh, that's what I was doing. Let's see.

Let me sign in. We're talking to two different teams. Let me log in really quickly.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I don't, let's see.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, let's go back.

[Speaker 1]
Can we set a clock countdown for A24 to July or is it just for that one? I, we can set a date once, um, I truly trust the date because I am not a fan of that. Does wag's tattoo give him special immunity?

Uh, sure. Wag, uh, will never be banned from the server because he got a tattoo. What's the pitch to normies on the utility of the coin?

Um, I believe, again, we will have, I think you'll be pleased with a lot of updates, um, but a conservative currency I think still stands. Is James really gone? James can come back when he starts, stops, uh, repeating.

Fuck Sarah. Yes, if you guys were doing that to anybody else and I've given you plenty of weeks to go ahead and vent, um, I think that's enough. Staking, when staking.

Hey, that would be awesome. Ronnie, are you a cat? I'm allergic to cats.

What if he meant he wanted to take you out for dinner and just miss, miss, oh, okay. I'm not pibs. If he said that about pibs, I'd be okay with it.

Him and him and pibs have a thing. Rather, I'd believe it. That's what I should say.

If the projected, if the project did staking, how would staking be funded? Uh, I'm not sure yet, but we can get there. Uh, once we get, we can answer that once we get there.

When James and pibs sponsored FJB date. Hey, I'll sponsor it. Gotta get pibs to approve.

Slinky and I will sponsor it. That's what I was checking. FJB date.

Yeah. All of us married folks want to see some entertaining dates play out. We need some excitement in our lives too.

FJB blind date, dating app. There you go. We can add that to the app.

At least, you know, the person's conservative. No blue hairs. Does FJB get to one cent this year?

You know, I can't answer that. Dog bone says, yes, a hundred percent. So egg says a penny by someday.

Have all debts been paid? No, we did start paying, uh, the wallet for the smart wallet. Testers today though.

I believe we paid everyone who was testing. Where did my messages disappear? Okay.

Uh, how much debt remains? I do not have that number on hand right now. I am still paying the bills from a card that's not, uh, being drafted from the crypto wallets, like just a credit card.

Um, I have been gone for a while sheltering from crypto winter since it's spring. Now what's on the roadmap by big things happening. Uh, we will have once, once we have everything in writing, uh, which we are hoping as soon as possible is when we can then announce, then, uh, continue with everything.

Uh, that includes the roadmap and the white paper told you before we wanted that before the end of the last year, 2022, but we wanted BNB to be on board for everything. We did not want to just BS you with a roadmap or a white paper, um, and not have those things come to fruition. We wanted to make sure that everything we told you is everything that we a hundred percent firmly believed was going to happen.

Um, and that's exactly what we're working on now. Okay. You heard Bannon on war room, uh, saying that this is going to be the year to grow FJB.

It's the money from tax while it's enough to cover all debts and pay for the app. Uh, we are good. I've also sold much of my coins, um, to have funds there that we should be fine to cover everything.

And we will keep you up late, updated on that. We will have more or be able to speak more on that. Uh, once we have everything in writing and then it kind of will all make sense.

Will BNB actually start talking to us directly again? I'm assuming you mean by coming in here, uh, we can definitely ask them to do that. My understanding was most everybody would rather have them on war room shilling the coin than in here, but that doesn't mean we can't have both or try for both.

I think timing will be great before they get, uh, busy with the 2024 campaign. I really need to stop eating this cake. Getter would be better.

Yeah, I agree. I think that would be political donations. Yes.

That's, um, that's, uh, on the agenda. Uh, what about Ryan, et cetera? Were they paid shillers or what was, is their story?

Um, I believe, and I'm not sure on this, my understanding was that Ryan and a few of the influencers were paid in coins. Um, and I know, I know of at least one that was paid, um, but not Ryan with actual, uh, cash or USDT Fiat basically. Um, but Ryan's a great guy and, uh, I'm sure I have no doubt he'd be on board to show us again.

Yeah. He, he genuinely is super nice guy. Him and Finn were honestly are good people.

I believe he owes us a yacht party. I think he'd be fine with that. I don't think he'd have a problem.

Never say never. Well, baby FJB get on the app. Yes.

Uh, that was the plan. They just, um, need to have specific volume to get listed with change now and transact. Well, definitely change now to get on the app, but that's definitely, uh, the plan with BNB.

We literally have the best chance ever at a Trump mention. I agree. We should get away from the FJB names to Dan, in my opinion.

Yeah. The, um, unfortunate part of that is even though we are freedom jobs business now, everybody kind of knows, especially in the conservative world, right? What FJB stands for.

And I firmly believe that's why we keep getting denied for every event, which is again, understandable, which is why, um, rebranding, I believe would be great for us when Halloween FJB coin, uh, have a great night. Did Bannon ever try pulling strings for us? So we are doing a fork.

Uh, I don't think so. Unless telegram says, so I know telegram had that idea, but I think that would be a mess. Um, but again, we never say never.

Uh, we, as far as rebranding, if that's what you're talking about, we're just talking about rebranding the app that way at events because our, um, LLC is not FJB. And so that wouldn't be an issue as long as we change the name of our app, which you all had a bunch of great ideas, then I think that would help us out a ton. So possibility of full launch on Moran before end of quarter one.

Um, I'm not sure about a full launch by then because I think the work, um, needed to do everything that's being proposed right now and waiting to be finalized might take longer than that. I think it'd get pretty close though. And then between that and then to actually get it on war room.

Yeah. I wouldn't promise that, but again, never say never, uh, for all in agreement, BNP are still involved. Why don't they just rebrand the app to the war room crypto app?

Not a bad idea. I don't know, um, how that would work as far as legalities go to war room being a completely different LLC, um, having their own. Yeah.

I'm not sure how that would work. Sponsors and everything like that. I imagine that's the, the downside of that.

Um, what were a couple of your favorite ideas? I will share when I can in 10 years from now, nobody will give a yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

I agree. And a lot of like, understand a lot or enough older people, I think kind of see that and, you know, cringe a little bit at it. No, I understand.

I don't, I don't think you're being negative. I think, I think it's telling when we've not been approved for one event and these are all the very conservative events. So, and I think that says something or, um, even conservative platforms like my store.

I think that speaks for itself and, uh, we need to be more strategic about it. It's not bowing down to, you know, the left or anything like that, but, and I think it'll appeal to a lot more people that way too. You just want to be seen as decent.

Yeah, absolutely. That's I think some people might see it as even, you know, unprofessional or what have you. Uh, if app name changed, will we run into this issues like we talked about before?

Hmm. Um, you mean about changing the logos? I'm assuming.

Um, I'm told from multiple people that that's not the case. Okay. Yes.

Uh, yeah, I'm told from multiple people, that's not the case, but this is more than willing to test that out for us once it's time. So that shouldn't be an issue. The left are known as a nasty group.

Let's keep it that way. Absolutely. I agree.

I agree. FJB, you know, fun while it lasted. And I think everybody still believes in that.

I think even the left is, you know, believing in that can change the skin. Oh yeah. So Donnie, the issue with that is Besh had said that he thinks, um, updating the logo in the Google store and the Apple store, uh, that would cause Vest to basically mess, like delete people's, uh, authorizations on their code.

But Vest said they didn't think so, but they're willing to test it for us. And a few other Patriots in the chat said that they've worked on plenty of apps and that they didn't think that would happen by simply changing the name or the logo. Deplorable coin.

Yeah. Um, I have a list somewhere of all of your great ideas, but we can always, you know, vote on that. And once we get there, let's see.

We had, had a pretty good transact month, a good volume for our monthly summary. Why marketing wallet being changed out of FJBs on the rise? Uh, so we don't have to dump at once every time we need to reimburse or pay something.

I think if we were to go really big and be a parallel currency, we should have a more neutral name. We'll get public. Yeah, I, uh, agree.

The more people you're just going to, uh, really reach that way. The biggest flaw in the original contract was the marketing and charity wallets being an FJB always been a grip. Yeah.

Uh, somebody was saying there's actually a way like to possibly code it into a stable or having like percentages go into stable coin. All right. Any other questions?

I think that's it. Um, we have been, I think, you know, everybody got their time to vent. We have been cleaning up both the telegram and the discord channel.

Uh, just in case we do have people come in, um, you know, new people come in trying to check out the community and the coin. So please don't take it personal. Uh, it's just for the best interest of the coin and the community.

Again, I understand emotions are high and I understand you all had your time to vent. Um, so again, please don't take that personal. I think we've unbanned the few people that did get banned in the past week or so, but again, it's not anything personal.

I think you've had enough time to do that and now it's just not in the best interest of the community. Feel free as always to DM me and vent your frustrations. Um, that's totally fine.

The side chats, totally fine. Um, but again, in the general chats, it's just not in the best interest of the coin. Uh, feel free to DM me with anything you'd like to vent that way.

Um, any type of burn type thing, or are we keeping the coins that we have from here on out? Um, we will have more on that soon. I think, um, sorry, I'm not trying to be secretive, but I think as soon as we get everything in writing, I think everything will make a little bit more sense.

And, um, I think from there we'll finally have a good flow and movement. I really do, uh, believe that. Donnie, Finn is a good guy.

I'm trying not to spill anything. Okay. I gotta, I gotta keep it in.

I got in trouble for that. Okay. I'll have to listen back and, uh, see.

I didn't realize I, um, did that much, but I just don't want to spill anything. I'm not supposed to. What do you mean, Sarah?

What do I mean about what? About, uh, spilling any beans to you guys. Do you practice your voice calls in the mirror prior?

I don't. No. I was, um, I did actually practice the one because I, yeah, because I didn't know what the heck I was going to say at the one and back in August.

Yeah. That was a nerve wracking one. Not in the mirror though.

Donnie, just to prepare your video calls. What video calls? Oh, I think I missed a lot of those.

I think a lot of that happened while I was overseas and I was on a different time than you all. Early drunk days. All of a sudden Donnie's acting like he's sober now.

Well, no, FJB is back when Donnie gets back on his video calls. Nope. We need the video call to prove it.

And then get, uh, Raven on because somebody was asking for a picture. I think Romeo was. Romeo must have missed that picture of the early days.

Bummer.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Can we burn 20 billion coins? I, I got something better. I think you all will be very pleased.

Don, you missed it. There is, there's a screenshots going around Donnie. Come on.

Thank you. Dog bone. Awesome.

Well, uh, I think that's a wrap. Let me know if you have any other questions. Um, I hope to have more updates for you.

Actual updates, uh, as soon as possible. I wish I already did. Um, but I think we're closer than we have been for a very long time, which is great.

And, I think you all will be very happy. Uh, you have a great night. I will post the recording, uh, right now before I get off my desk top.

Uh, talk to you all soon again, DM me or tag me if you need anything else as usual. Be safe.
