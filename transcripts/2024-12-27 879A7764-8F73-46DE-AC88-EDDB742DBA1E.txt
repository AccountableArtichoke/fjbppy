Hello, happy Friday. Hope everybody had a very merry Christmas. Hopefully you and your families were not sick like I was.

I just wanted to jump on here. I had a meeting scheduled with Maureen earlier this week. She was not feeling well after AmFest so she is asking to reschedule.

I'm hoping that it happens either this weekend or early next week. I understand you guys are frustrated with this. I am also, but this is necessary to move forward.

Again, what we're waiting on is just basically to get some things on the calendar to get scheduled to start pushing Patriot Pay out to the War Room crowd, which is why, again, it's very important that we get these features scheduled. I will update you guys as soon as I have an update. As far as everything else, I know some of you are DMing me, things like that.

We're just trying to get somebody else to step in and take care of everything like that, that I've been taking care of. It's not that I'm too busy for you or anything like that. We're just trying to get somebody else to take care of those things.

I will let you guys know as soon as we have an update. Again, it will be, if not this weekend, early next week. Hope you all have a safe and great weekend.

I will talk to you soon.
