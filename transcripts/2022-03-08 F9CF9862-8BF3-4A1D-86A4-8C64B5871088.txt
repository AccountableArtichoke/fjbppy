You've got to pump it up, you've got to pump it up Don't you know, pump it up March 8th, we have exactly eight days. Eight days into the app. Eight days into the app.

(2:25 - 2:38)
I'm freaking juiced about it. FJB app, like we all said, like we've been talking about for the longest time, it's finally coming in. Eight days. 

Eight days. I am so beyond excited. You guys should be so excited.

(2:38 - 2:46)
I really have nothing to tell you guys besides the fact that I'm juiced. I really am pumped because you guys deserve this. You guys have been here since the beginning.

(2:47 - 2:59)
There's a lot of people that I know that has been here since October, November, even December, even that's still early. If you're still getting in here now, welcome. So happy that you guys are here.

(2:59 - 3:23)
But I see a lot of familiar faces since the beginning, and I really think that we've become really close since the whole start. And if you've been in here since October, man, it's an awesome ride. It's been up and down. 

It's been rocky. It's been spooky at times. It's been fun. 

It's been a lot of fun. But it's also been a whole range of emotions. What are they saying? And the other guys, it's been a ballet of emotions.

(3:24 - 3:33)
That's what it's been. And I just love you guys. I just love that you guys are all here. 

I miss you guys. I miss you guys a lot. I miss talking to you guys every night.

(3:33 - 3:59)
I used to do this every single night. Kind of looking back, I was like, that's kind of crazy. Those times I would be and I've calmed down. 

I've calmed down a lot. I've been sleeping more, actually getting like over six or seven hours, which feels good. But there's been times, the beginning, probably the first 50 days, I wouldn't sleep more than, I wouldn't allow myself to sleep for more than one hour at a time.

(4:00 - 4:11)
I would sleep like literally 55 minutes and then I would set an alarm. And then I would check and then I would sleep 55 minutes and set an alarm because I wanted to make sure that everything was okay. And the Discord, everything was okay and Telegram.

(4:12 - 4:20)
And this is my life and it's still my life. I still love this thing so much. And this is the thing I think about 24-7.

(4:20 - 4:42)
It's true. And I don't know what quote it is, but it's like find what you love and let it kill you. And that's kind of what FJB was for me. 

And it still is. I love this thing. I love it so much. 

That's why I'm still here. I wouldn't be here doing this if I wasn't your biggest fan, if I wasn't all of your guys' biggest fans. This is the people in here that are truly incredible.

(4:43 - 4:59)
And I just want to say thank you guys for everything. Seriously. Thank you guys for being here. 

And thank you guys so much. From the start, we've been through a lot of fun things like the McNuggets, like the pizza, I mean the pizza, saltine crackers. What else did I do? Hot dogs.

(4:59 - 5:08)
I think it's only right before the app that I slam a pizza because I've been talking about the pizza for a long time. So I think it's only right. I think that's fair.

(5:08 - 5:18)
Before the app comes out, we do something like old times sake for all the people that have been here since the jump. Something fun to do. I think that's a pizza slam.

(5:18 - 5:31)
And then I'm just looking forward to the future, man. I'm looking forward to meeting up with you guys and shooting the breeze and hanging out and doing some FJB parties and stuff like that. I think that would be a blast.

(5:33 - 5:40)
That's all I really wanted to say tonight. So happy and excited for the app. I'm so happy for everybody to see it.

(5:41 - 5:47)
There's a baller team working on it. And you guys are the best. You guys are really the best.

(5:47 - 5:54)
You guys are the best community in crypto. And this thing is a hell of a lot more than just a coin. So thank you guys all for being here.

(5:54 - 6:10)
Let's keep bringing the juice. Let's keep getting excited. I don't even think I'm allowed on StockTwits anymore, but I want to get back on pushing this thing 24-7, no matter what it is, no matter if it's StockTwits or Twitter or Instagram or anything that we might have.

(6:11 - 6:19)
I'm so excited about the app. This is the thing we've been talking about for months, and now it's finally coming, Omegle. Remember the Omegle special? That's the funny thing.

(6:19 - 6:36)
So starting tomorrow, tomorrow is one week officially. I think starting tomorrow, we initiate shill week. I think it's shill week. 

We go freaking hard. Starting tomorrow, we really take to the Internet again, and it's just shill all week. We shill, shill, shill.

(6:36 - 6:40)
It's all we do is shill, shill, shill. Oh, there's Twan. I haven't seen Twan in a little bit.

(6:40 - 6:48)
How are you doing, Twan? But we shill hard, and we let everybody know that the app is coming out in one week. One, one week. I can't wait for that.

(6:49 - 6:53)
We're going to shill and shill. We're going to hang out. Maybe we'll do a little, like, happy hour shill party.

(6:53 - 7:01)
I don't know. Who knows? We'll think of some good things, but just stay in the Discord. Stay excited. 

Stay having fun. I'm freaking juiced. I'm pumped out of my mind.

(7:02 - 7:14)
I'm pumped. Oh, Donnie, I want you to come up here and say something, and then we're going to finish off with Donnie. I'll let myself go. 

I want to invite Donnie up here. How do I invite him up here? I think you can just come up and invite him up to speak. He's going to come up here and say something and fire up the crowd.

(7:15 - 7:19)
There he is. Oh, shit. I've never been up here before.

(7:20 - 7:38)
Really? Never? Never in my life have I been up here. What's happening? Donnie, what's up, my brother? How you doing? I'll tell you what the crack is. I want to say, see you this week because it's shill week, and we're coming up to the app, and we're going to be fucking seven days now.

(7:39 - 8:17)
We're trying to organize a crowd of people to put together a bit of FJB coin to whoever shills the shit out of everywhere, anywhere, anywhere that you can think of. Just shill like fucking mad all week, and whoever we think has done above and beyond will get that wallet come the end of the week. Donnie, I love that idea. 

I love that. I think that the community is going to get fully behind that. I'll absolutely contribute to that, and I think that a lot of people will too.

(8:18 - 8:28)
At the minute, we're at 650,000. We're at 650 right now? 650 right now, yeah. I'll throw a million too.

(8:29 - 8:35)
Well, then we're 1.65 million. It sounds good. Let's do it.

(8:36 - 8:44)
So let's fucking go. Shill the shit out of this all week. FJB app, fucking one week from now.

(8:44 - 9:05)
Let's fucking go. This is like, what is it, like in Friday Night Lights? Or was it Friday Night Lights or any given Sunday? I'm not sure if you've seen those movies, but it's like 30 minutes for the rest of our lives. It's like we got one week of this thing where we can talk about FJB the most we can until this app comes out.

(9:05 - 9:22)
And once the app comes out, it's like, boom, we're moving forward, and that's where we can get to the masses. But until then, tell everybody that you know about it, because we have an app coming out, and that's pretty dang exciting. And I think it's just going to be something cool to be a part of.

(9:23 - 9:27)
So I love that idea, Donnie. Donnie, finish us off here. Get us pumped up for Shill Week.

(9:27 - 9:40)
Shill Week starts at midnight Eastern, and we're riding this thing. Let's fucking go. Like, let's hit stock twits tomorrow.

(9:40 - 9:47)
Let's get us a number fucking one tomorrow morning. Blow this shit out of the water. Hit the fucking socials.

(9:47 - 9:53)
Go fucking metal. We're going to blow this shit out of the water. Like, everybody else is going to be red.

(9:53 - 9:57)
We're going to be fucking green. Let's go. Army fucking up, Donnie.

(9:58 - 10:02)
All right, Shill Week starting at midnight. Get some sleep. Get ready.

(10:02 - 10:08)
Get your socks ready to get blown off. Let's take this thing to the next level. Everybody have a great night.
