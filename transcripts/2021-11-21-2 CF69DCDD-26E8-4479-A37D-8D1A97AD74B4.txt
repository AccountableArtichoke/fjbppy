Don't you know don't you know don't you know No. You got to pump it up, don't you know pump it up What's going on?

[Speaker 2]
Can you guys hear me? What's up? What's up?

What's up? All right, we got 111 in here. Let's get to 120.

Come on. Oh, now the numbers are coming. Somebody tell somebody else to come in here.

Let's get this thing to 200 tonight. I think our numbers have been slacking this weekend. Let's see what we got.

[Speaker 3]
Get your ass in the chat. I want to see you. All right, that's it.

Get your ass in the chat. Get your ass in the chat right now. All right.

All right. What do we got? We got 130 people.

[Speaker 2]
Not bad. Come on. I think we can get at least 150 tonight.

I'm a little disappointed. Ryan's coming on. I even let you guys know that Ryan was coming on in the future.

And when Ryan comes on, things get things get saucy. Things are getting good. What do we got?

What do we got? Let's go. We got 134.

Give me 140 and I'll start talking about some things. Give me 140 and we'll start chitchatting. I'm a little earlier than usual.

I told you guys seven o'clock.

[Speaker 3]
It's 706. I'm here. All right.

All right. All right. What do we got?

135. That's not bad. Pull up my notes.

I pull up my notes over here. We got going on. All right.

Good. Now we're hitting a plateau 135.

[Speaker 2]
I got I got some things I'm going to talk about that. I'm gonna bring up Ryan here. We're gonna chitchat about some things.

We're gonna talk about some good stuff. And then we're gonna have an unbelievable night. It's a Sunday night.

The Washington football team won today. I don't know if you guys have seen, but they're the best team in the NFL. And it's going to be fantastic.

And I got and I got Jared Cook fever. Jared Cook is going to score the first touchdown in the Los Angeles Chargers game tonight. And if he does that, if Jared Cook scores the first touchdown in the L.A. Chargers game tonight, I will donate 500 dollars, a charity of somebody's choice.

[Speaker 3]
Market it. Random thing. Random thing.

But if but if he scores that first touchdown, 500 bucks.

[Speaker 2]
I know that's not more in the chat because they were expecting the 10 minute cushion. What do we got? 137.

[Speaker 3]
Give me three more. I'm going to go smoke a cigarette. Give me three more.

Almost there. We're close. Hakuna Matata.

I don't know why I can't hear anything.

[Speaker 2]
What do we got in here? Who are some standouts this past week that are in here? I see a bunch of people to rock.

He's the man. We we did that donation yesterday. Twan's awesome.

Chicago Jacob has been killing it. Bob 24 is a staple. We have a great group.

I'm scrolling down the list to give my give my weekly shout outs. Oh, Captain Joe. Who else we got?

Not Arcus has 34. We need a junior nine fees. Spite Donald Pump bringing the heat.

Bisk always reacting to messages. Blueface investor. I think he's been to every single voice session.

We got 142. We're starting out. What's going on, everybody?

Happy Sunday night. It is November 21st. We are day 30, actually 30 days in some.

I'm going to use this time to do some highlights of what happened. Currently, I actually haven't even looked at the price all day. So I'm going to pull that up real quick.

Let's take a look at the price. Mark gap, 47 mil. That's all right.

It's holding steady. Whatever that we had our little Saturday dip. Oh, well, I hop on voice.

And before I hop on voice, somebody wants to unload 15 grand. Wow. I think everybody's shorting shorting me up here.

But we have holders. Let's see what we got. Holders.

We got it on the verge of sixty four hundred thirty days. I think if you look at 10 days ago, I wish I could see the holders like in a in a graph 10 days ago. The number of holders that we had was probably like three thousand.

We probably doubled holders invested at least at the very least, if not more, probably probably like fifteen hundred ten days ago. I just remember I remember our first hundred holders when we posted that graphic. I was getting into the car and I was like, holy shit, like we have 100 people that got this thing.

And now next milestone for us is going to be not even a milestone. Stepping stone is going to be ten thousand holders because we're at sixty almost four hundred right now. We're going to get to ten thousand.

And we're and the best part about it is this is what I wanted to talk about first where I brought Ryan up. We're not even on exchanges right now. That's the funniest part.

I would be damned if I saw if I met another coin, if there was another coin out there that has almost seven thousand holders. Almost ten thousand people across communities and followers and social media. They're not even on exchange.

And then to top that, that have donated fifty thousand dollars, like legitimately fifty thousand dollars to charity. We've donated to that in the first 30 days. That's fucking unbelievable.

Exactly. Ten twenty eight. We had 100 holders.

October 28th. We had 100 holders. It's not we haven't even had a month from there.

And we're at sixty four hundred holders. That is unbelievable. Hats off to you guys.

And the best part about it is screw the holders. Screw the price. We've donated 50 grand and we're only donating more.

But what I want to tell you guys tonight is we are supposed to get listed on Probit last week, as you guys saw. They told me Wednesday. Then they told me Thursday and they told me Friday.

And then on Friday, when that rolled around, they were like, hey, our people are off. I was like, what are you talking about? It's a Friday.

Get your ass to work. They said, no, we're off. And I was like, all right, whatever.

I have no idea what that means. But I was like, you guys are being lazy. And then we got into an argument on Telegram about it.

And the guy was like, we sleep less than you. I was like, OK, whatever you want to say. But we don't want to keep poking the bear because we don't want them to make it slower than usual.

But they are working on this for us, and it should be. So hopefully tomorrow, Tuesday, if it's if it's Wednesday, I'm going to blow a gasket on Probit. But Probit is coming and WhiteBit, we paid for expedited listing on that.

They gave us the preliminary Thursday. Fingers crossed that it's before because we have tremendous news that could be dropping before that. And if the tremendous news drops before that, we will be listed earlier than that and there will be listings out the ass.

But what I wanted to say about that is I mentioned it today on my voice session this morning. I hopped on quick just to address some some FUD that was being spread, but. You have to understand that we have 6400 holders right now, again, not on exchange.

When we get listed on exchanges, we're getting listed on Probit and WhiteBit. That's a definite. We have meetings tomorrow with BitMart and Bittrex, which are like the holy grails of Binance coins.

So you have to understand is when you get listed on these exchanges. You're only going to get buy orders because new people are coming in. It's a new exchanges.

So everybody that's on here right now has already bought in or bought and sold, bought and sold like like normal. We're getting on these exchanges. So that means that more people are coming in and they're all going to be buy orders.

But all those buy orders do is increases the price, increases the market cap, increases the number of holders. Those are all tremendously bullish signals because we're getting listed on these. That's just getting more eyes and ease to buy this.

And that's been the number one thing is ease of buying this thing. And the volume increases. Exactly.

Everything, everything goes up. There's there's not one bad thing about getting listed on exchange. And we're getting on Probit and WhiteBit.

And then we're also having meetings with Bittrex and BitMart. We've applied to a bunch of others. We've been working on a bunch of others.

So just like just take a step back and zoom out, like I always say, and say, imagine being in this right now and you might be impatient. Yeah, it's only day 30, though, first of all. But imagine being in the first 30 days, being a patient and then saying, you know what?

I feel like selling because. I've been here too long and I feel like this has lost its mojo and we haven't even been listed on an exchange. Now, if this was 30 days ago and we were listed on exchanges and we've been doing everything that we can, we dropped our big news that we've been talking about for over a week now.

And nothing has changed. I would say, you know what? That makes a lot of sense.

You're completely right. But this is kind of like we have this tremendous catalyst that's coming. We have these other exchanges that are listing us.

And we're doing everything that we can to make this thing and build this foundation up the perfect that it can be so that this thing is ready to launch into the complete next level. And imagine just being impatient enough for and not even waiting just a couple of days to see this thing through, because I just I just I don't ask you guys, but I'm just saying, give us a couple of days. If you don't like what you see, I will be shocked.

I will be absolutely shocked. But all right. That's all I wanted to say about that.

Just wanted to touch on that for just a second. Now we're bringing up Ryan, because Ryan is who you guys are. There's 163 people here.

That's not for me. You guys are tired of hearing me. I'm tired of hearing myself.

I talk all day long. But Ryan's going to be coming up in here and talking. And then that's when things get awesome, because he's the man.

And if you guys were here on that first call with Ryan, that was tremendous.

[Speaker 3]
So Ryan, I just invited him up here. He should be here. He's got his purple name.

He's the only purple name up here. What's up, Ryan? How are you?

[Speaker 1]
What is up? What is up? Everybody can hear me, right?

I'm assuming.

[Speaker 2]
I can't hear you, Ryan. I don't know why.

[Speaker 3]
Maybe it's just me. Oh, shit.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know what I did. Can you guys hear Ryan? Oh, it's just me.

Oh, I hate my life.

[Speaker 1]
I hate my absolute life. Oh, is it just you? Oh, they can hear me, right?

I'm assuming by the clicks, that means they're by the.

[Speaker 3]
Hey, Drew, what is going on? What's up?

[Speaker 2]
I think it's just you. Oh, no. Now I'm panicking.

[Speaker 3]
They can hear Ryan. Yeah. Uh-oh.

I can. Wait, what if I do this? I'm no expert at this, but.

Oh, no. I think the liberals got into our group.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're being canceled. He's being canceled right now.

[Speaker 3]
And I'm probably talking over him right now. Oh, this sucks. No, they really got my ass.

No, they're tricking me. Somebody's trying to trick me. Anything now?

What I'm going to do is this. Yeah, you guys can't hear Ryan right now because he's not talking. Prez is restarting his Discord and he'll be back in.

There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I have to say, before he gets back in here, you guys, from what I understand, next week's going to be a very big week. A lot of stuff coming down the pipeline. Now, like I said, for anybody new here, I started Students for Trump a long time ago as a Twitter account when he started running and it became a viral sensation.

Oh, there he is.

[Speaker 3]
He's coming back. I think it might be loading him in.

[Speaker 1]
Well, anyway, so I started this years ago and it just picked up, blew up because people love Trump. And I guess to sum it up, that's how I got to where I'm at. Unexpectedly, out of the blue, sort of one of those things that came out of nowhere, right?

And so now we're working to make the country better, push America first policies. And one of the reasons why I personally jumped behind this was a couple people came to me. There's a lot of people talking about this coin in case you guys didn't know.

Literally all across the conservative sphere is now these cryptocurrency conversations. And the guy who brought this to me is actually the founder of Old Row. I don't know if anyone in here knows what Old Row is, but essentially what these guys are is they do college lifestyle postings on Instagram.

They're very big. And they came back and they said that this was something you should look into. And that's why I jumped behind this coin really was because he, Swig is his name, is a big crypto guy.

And so coming into this, I wouldn't have known otherwise if this was legitimate or not until he told me about it. But what you guys have done, the dedication here behind something that you really don't even have to care about, you can go on with your day, you can go buy into SHIB, you can do all which way the other is that you guys care about the movement and you care about, you know, you want to make some money. Right.

But in doing so, you're also benefiting other people. You know, and I think that that's the thing that is so powerful here.

[Speaker 3]
And I told Grant, you know, we need to take this out of the discord and we're going to do a chat this week. Do something where it's not just stuck in this corner.

[Speaker 1]
We're going to go. We're going to bring this to a voice chat aiming for Wednesday, I told Grant, and we're going to have some announcements there. And for some who can't hear me, I grant couldn't hear me either.

If you can't hear, just let us know. But I think one of the best things to do is probably restart your discord. But what we're doing is going to bring a conversation over there, because that's the only way that you're going to get people into here.

You know, this is great to do these conversations for general updates, but when we really want to bring in the masses, we need to go out to the platforms where the masses are on. And you guys have been doing a great job with that shilling, going out there, being interactive. That's so important for someone like me.

This is all new, but I also understand how to market, how to brand. You can't just sit in your own chat room and do it. You got to go out there.

You got to go to businesses. You got to go to this, that, and the third to get the word out. And you guys have done a phenomenal job at that with these kind of coordinated shill raids, which is great.

Keep up doing what you're doing. As you guys probably saw the other day, we just got published the Postmillennial article. Who is happy that the media is starting to talk about this for once and for all?

I mean, come on, guys. The media is now starting to talk about this. That's one thing that we always have the hardest time with because these outlets, a lot of them won't touch something like this.

They'll barely touch some shib or doge only when it benefits them. And so in this situation, we've been kind of picking through. I was able to get us the Postmillennial.

We're working on a few other outlets right now. I won't spoil it, but we have two other outlets right now that I'm in talks with on this cryptocurrency and why they need to talk about it. And the biggest angle, really, and you guys know this, is the money that has been given to veterans.

In less than a month, $50,000 has been given to some amazing vet organizations. I know Grant mentioned last week that one of those, the guys started crying to him on the phone, and I've witnessed that myself when we've raised money for other groups over the years, is these folks don't get looked after all the time. And your donors aren't going to them.

They're going to the big organizations. So I really, really do appreciate the fact that we are looking at organizations that aren't necessarily getting a million dollar checks in the mail every single year around Christmas time. We're looking at the guys who are trying their hardest to stay afloat, but yet they have people that they are benefiting every single day.

And that's so important, so critical, because it is a community that's looked over so many times out of the year, despite all of the conversation that's on it. And the terrible VA that we have in this country doesn't help either. One other big thing that I want to mention as well that I talked to Grant about, who here has heard of Turning Point USA?

Anybody here heard of Turning Point, Charlie Kirk? I have. I'm back.

I can hear you. There you go. I missed you a second.

I was like, I know what's going on with this discord here. They're censoring it. But so we have, there is a party at the end of the year, actually next month, the end of the year.

Jesus, it's like literally we're already going to be approaching December here, which is absolutely incredible to me. We are sponsoring, and I got Grant to do this, we're sponsoring a party that's going to be happening at the TPUSA conference in Arizona. It's the Grand Young Party.

Bryson Gray is going to be performing at the party, and there's going to be an estimate of about 1,500 to 2,000 young people at this conference who are attending the conference. Labeling, branding, QR codes, everything will be public at this event. It will be a blast off because the people that'll be in this room who are influential within the conservative circle, they will be there as well.

And Grant will be in attendance also. So I'm personally dedicating that evening. I can't remember the date.

Grant, do you remember the date? It's the Sunday night, I think the 19th, Sunday, the night. So right before Christmas, we're going to be in a big room with a lot of influencers, a lot of people who are big on TikTok, which is another thing we got to talk about as well, because we're bringing on some people that are going to help with TikTok as well.

Really big organization, big group. I won't go into the name because it's not solidified yet, but they basically control the conservative TikTok market, and they help those guys build their pages, build their brand. They are absolutely viral, and they're going to be a big help.

Now, with this party, the big sell here and the big thing here is right before Christmas, Bryce and Grace performing. I believe they have another guy, 4G Auto Blow, performing. And there's going to be a lot of people in the room, a lot of people to where they can scan this QR code, get on this platform, buy into this coin.

Because really, I mean, the big selling point, like I said, again, is the work that has been done, that you guys have done, that going to these charities. This is the absolute pinnacle, I think, is getting into turning point, getting into these different arenas where people know about it. And they're going to be willing to shill for it because these guys really haven't endorsed crypto either, which is important to note.

They haven't endorsed crypto, really. So this is going to be kind of like pop in the cherry first time for them. And I think it's going to be a big selling point.

Now, I can't talk about much of what is happening early next week, but I can tell you that on a scale for me, it's very big. And it came as a surprise when Grant told me about some meetings coming up early next week. But I will say if that stuff does go through, I am verifiably saying myself that it's going to be absolutely huge.

And I can't go into the data. Yeah, there's a chart right there. Yeah, that little chart that I just gave the little Donald Trump emoji on that, that's pretty accurate as to what the line might look like after the announcements.

But I, you know, one thing that I also must say is we're not done with the media. The media is coming up. We got a lot more outlets that I want to target personally that we're going to get on board, more influencers.

I haven't had time much of last week. I made a promise to Grant that we're going to find more people to learn about this coin, to jump on board with it, to plug people in. And that's where it comes in.

As you guys understand that, you know, sure, we can all go and share this thing on our page, but there's nothing quite effective as somebody who has 20, 30, 40, 100, half a million, a million followers plugging it to their page, because out of that population, there's probably at least one to 5% of their audience that trades or has traded crypto before. And they're going to be interested in this. And that's where you get the conversation starting.

The way Google works, the way social media works is the more stuff is mentioned, the higher it trends. That is very simple. And it's been like that for a while.

But you guys have been phenomenal. I'm trying to see here if there's anything else, because I wrote down a small list here just to make sure. Um, let's see here.

So we talked about the party. We talked about the post-millennial. I will tell you guys I'm working on Breitbart.

They seem very interested in this. If anybody knows what Breitbart is, uh, well, let's just say that number one conservative site in the country. Uh, we got Breitbart.

I'm published there usually all the time. In fact, what I grant, I didn't even think of this. I didn't even think of this.

I, uh, I'm having kind of, uh, I'm drinking some wine right now, but I'm kind of having an epiphany. I'm a contributor at Breitbart, like literally a contributor. I can write a piece and they can publish the piece.

I know I'm over here trying to get somebody to write a piece and I just, I'm a, I'm a contributor for the outlet. So why play huge?

[Speaker 2]
We didn't even talk about this before.

[Speaker 1]
I know. Well, it's also like, I don't contribute there often cause it takes time to write an article and it's like, God almighty, there's no time in the world anymore. I think that's what we'll do.

We'll get an article together and we'll get it up on Breitbart if they allow that to happen. I don't want them to do some self promo kind of bullshit, but I think we can have it happen. Um, I'm trying to think, does anybody have any questions for me?

Cause I know I've gotten quite a few messages from people. Uh, I got a message earlier from somebody who I, I just read it a little bit earlier where they were thanking me essentially for, you know, being on this coin. They said, they're, um, they're an FJB holder.

Very grateful support. Uh, thank you on behalf of disabled veterans. I'm not sure if this person is a disabled vet or not, but you're, you're going to go, you're going to meet these folks, right.

Who are going to join this community who may benefit from the donations and charity that's coming out there. Um, and that to me is like the biggest crossover in history. It's when people who are actually disabled vets who benefit from the charity work, come and be a part of the community.

That to me is everything. And that's something that we are, uh, I'm a hundred percent disabled Marine. So the guy who did message me, he's listening in the chat.

Actually, he's actually a disabled Marine. Um, spider, not staff is his name spider. I wanted to thank you for messaging me saying that amazing message, you know, stay in support.

If you have buddies, bring them on board because this is a journey. And one thing I've, I've learned doing crypto this year. And I said, again, I'm novice.

I'm not some expert on this. I'm not Dave Portnoy. I don't lose millions of dollars every single week, trading this crap.

I just know that the movement supports this and that there is an absolute utility behind let's go. Brandon, um, going out there and sticking it to the president or the resident of the United States of America in such a fashion as we're doing right now. And the country is doing nothing says more than being the most popular president with 81 million votes than stadiums across the country, lighting up with fuck Joe Biden and let's go Brandon chats.

Nothing more shows how much of a positive and populist president you are than that happening in this country. And that message is strong. It doesn't die out in a year.

It doesn't die out in, in, in two years, he's in office for another three years. Yes. I'm a holder.

I actually own 5,000 in the coin. I'm probably going to buy another 5,000 this week. Um, I haven't disclosed that before, but I will say I absolutely love this coin.

Uh, it's going to have longevity. Uh, after hearing about what's coming up this week, I'm very excited for it. Hopefully it goes through, uh, this deal, these talks that are coming up.

I know everybody is in this mood where it's like, Oh, we want the markets. We want this and that. And, and to my understanding, you know, even for me, nothing's instant.

I don't get things instantaneously. And I've learned that, you know, with this stuff, it's like, you're waiting on time zones. You're waiting on people to get things listed.

The coins also a little bit political. So if you have some Biden people, they're going to probably have pushback. You know, there's a lot going out there, but you guys need to be proud of the fact that you are at this point right now where I just came on like a week and a half ago, and you already have 6,400, you know, holders.

And really there's not much going in terms of promotion. It's pretty, you know, it's pretty minimal, you know, there could be a heck of a lot more, but look at what you've gotten to. And I mean, that to me is just incredible because I've seen new cryptos.

I see them all the time popping up and they barely even have a community. I mean, the other Let's Go Brandon coin or whatever, whatever they got going on over there in that operation. I mean, we saw their discord last week.

People are spamming photos of genitals and FU this and FU that. So clearly they're not organized. You guys are top tier when it comes to Let's Go Brandon FJB coin.

And that's a, you know, that's what you guys got to keep in mind. But, you know, what I'll say is people keep asking, they're like, why don't you do the Trump? And I'm like, well, you know, first of all, first of all, let me tell you something.

I see me, my beautiful self holding up my fist in the chat when I was at the WWE. Let me tell you something. We are going to make this coin greater than any coin that has ever existed in the history of this country.

Believe me, even Melania agrees with me and she's got her own cryptocurrency. I forgot what it's called. It's pretty successful, but we won't talk about it.

We are going to build the biggest wall. And when I talk about a wall, I'm talking about a stock chart. I'm talking about a stock chart.

Don't be a cutie pie. I see that. We're going to build a wall.

It's going to be a steady grow, some steady growth. We're going to see a lot of green, a lot of green, and that wall is going to be stronger than it has ever been before. Believe me, believe me.

Let me tell you something. One message to unite this country. Fuck Joe Biden.

Fuck Joe Biden. We are going to build a wall. Let's go, Brandon.

Let's make this country greater than it's ever been before. We are going to make America great again. We are going to make America strong again.

And we are going to kill all of the competition. We're going to get them off the radar. We're going to keep moving forward stronger than ever before.

Do not give up. Do not sit down. You are a part of one of the greatest movements in American history.

Thank you and God bless America. Now we need Lee Greenwood to end that off with God bless America playing on the radio.

[Speaker 2]
Unfortunately, you said you're going to send me that MP3, but you're the man, Ryan. Thank you so much for coming here tonight. I'm getting juiced up now and it's my coin.

You're telling me things and I'm like, oh shit, this thing is awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Well, Grant, I told them for next week, we are going to do a Twitter. We're going to figure it out because not everybody here is Twitter. If you don't, I encourage you make an account tonight, do some posts, make it look legit, get a profile photo up there.

We're going to aim for Wednesday night, I think. Does that work with you, Grant? So we're going to do a voice chat.

And the way these voice chats work is once the LGB coin goes live on Twitter and starts a voice room, I'll join in, Grant joins in, everybody joins in. It'll make us co-hosts. And hopefully at that point in time, I'll have some more crypto folks from the industry.

And if anybody knows anybody, please send me a DM. Anybody you know who's known in crypto, if you know anybody with a decent following, I want to get the room filled with that, to have just a discussion on what not only what's happening in this country, but the importance of this coin and where it's going next. And we're going to do that.

It's going to bring in hundreds of people who have no clue what the heck we're talking about, but are going to learn in that conversation. So, but that's all I got. Thank you so much, Grant.

[Speaker 2]
Man, Ryan, thank you. I'm excited about this week and I couldn't be more excited to have you a part of this thing. Everybody have a great night.

Like I said, I'm going to keep you updated. Jared Cook scores the first touchdown of the game. I'll donate $500 of my own money to somebody's charity.

But let's keep this thing moving. Let's keep this thing going. Thank you so much, Ryan.

Everybody hats off to him. Have a great week.
