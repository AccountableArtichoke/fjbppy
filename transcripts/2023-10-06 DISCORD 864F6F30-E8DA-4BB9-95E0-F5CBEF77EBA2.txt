[Speaker 1]
Hey, hoping everybody can hear me. I got the recorder going. Sorry about the late voice chat, at least for you all on the East Coast.

It's only 8 45 here, but I had dinner with the family and it went a little bit longer than expected. So just now getting back home. I actually was home before 5 30, but I didn't want to keep you all waiting.

Oh, sorry, I stopped the song. I didn't want to keep you all waiting. Make you think I was still at dinner or something.

All right. Happy Friday. It's been an amazing week.

Everything is still going very smoothly. We are all paid up for our last addition to the task. We made the first payment for the review and everything's going smoothly.

So far, so good. So that's excellent news. Hopefully that continues.

Let's see. I don't think I received any questions today. An awful lot of new alts with messages that I'm sure you all already have the answers to.

So I'm not going to waste your time going through those. But yeah, I don't have any questions in my inbox. So let me know if you have any questions, anything I can answer.

Again, we're still on track. So far, so good for the review. Task is 100% complete and paid for.

And devs are still working on the app. Again, first priority is getting those failed transactions fixed for a few hours. And we'll check that.

Okay, somebody sent their questions there. Graphics are...I'm waiting on like last...I don't want to say modifications, but I suppose they are. Because when we switched, when the graphic designer switched the file, the form it was in, a few things got misaligned.

They did say I should have those by the end of the day. The store, the merch store itself has been rebranded. So we'll just get those pieces all in there.

Everything should be up to date. Most things in the store now should not have FJB or our old website on them. Have the reviewers caught anything new?

So far, so good. Has the third party started their work yet? I thought that was supposed to be independent of the app being complete fixed.

That is independent of the app. It is not independent of the task. What utensils do you eat a steak with?

So we're carnivore ketosis. So we pretty much have steaks every day. And I'll be honest, sometimes I just want to cut it up and eat it with a fork.

I know you're not supposed to all cut it up beforehand, but that's my thing now. I'm not going to sit at dinner every day and cut my steak in my plate. That's very annoying.

Although that's supposed to be really rude to do. But otherwise, like if I'm out or my parents are, you know, in front of respectable people, then it's a knife and fork and I can't pre-cut it, I guess. Otherwise, just a fork slathered with a ton of butter.

When last did you get an update from the reviewers today? Midday, actually. Let's see the time that was.

Where is it? 10.43am. Of course, that's my time. I did ask them to give me updates for the community.

Update me on the progress so I could share it with my community. So I have no doubt they'll be doing that. Oh, I get what you were doing now.

Oh, I didn't even get that. Fork, fork, fork. I actually eat most everything with a fork, including like butter and yogurt and ice cream.

Tastes a lot better with a fork. Rarely ever do I use a spoon to eat with. Probably weird, I guess.

Are they still estimating 15 to 18 days or looking shorter? So far we're still, that time has not changed. I'm hoping to hear more this weekend or early next week.

Should be wonderful. I guess everybody's speculating a fork. I've seen a lot about that in the chats.

Gosh, it's been a lot warmer today and yesterday here. You guys jinxed it. Whoever asked me about the weather last week or earlier this week jinxed it.

Oh, that's what I was doing. I was checking my email to see if there's any questions there. Any plans for baby FGB?

Oh yeah, nothing has changed there. I would let you guys know if anything changed plan-wise. They're still doing great.

Yeah, no changes there as far as that goes. Keep checking my telegram because I feel like I usually get more questions there. A lot of either spammers or trolls lately on there.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, one project at a time.

[Speaker 1]
I think a lot of stuff depends on everything. It's kind of depending on the task right now, I think. Minus the app, that's still, that work is still being worked on.

But like I said before, that's independent of the app, so great. Can you give a summary of the week ahead? Yeah, let's hope that the review still goes well and as expected.

That would be great. Hopefully no change in the timeline unless it's a little bit shorter. I'll take that.

I'm sure you guys would too. Let's see. Our graphics must be completed by tonight, so we'll get that done in the merch store as soon as I can get those and complete the merch store items.

That's a big deal because then we can start applying to events as soon as events in the next week. So that's great. We're getting closer to...

We sent out several emails today to I guess marketing slash influencers, even if it's just our merch since we're still waiting on the task coin-wise and app-wise. And lastly, the app. We, you know, we have the devs on there.

They've still not worked through the failing transactions. Fingers crossed that this coming week is the week, but I will keep you all updated on that. Everything going smoothly so far.

So good. Of course, we don't know that that won't change. But I think we have amazing people working on this so they'll get it figured out.

So again, we, you know, growing the community, making something long-term while keeping secure, everything super secure. Just top, top priorities. Sounds like everything might go live by the same time, app, task, merch, etc.

Ooh, that would be amazing. That would be amazing, but we're not going to hold up the task for the app in case that's not figured out. In case they are still working on the app, we are not going to hold off.

If the task is completed before, then we'll go ahead and roll with that. That should be fine. Not holding up the task for the app.

Why not? Oh, I don't know. You guys figured that out.

Let me know. Let me know if you guys want to. That's fine.

We can hold up the task for the app if you prefer. Do you think we might get app fixes as they come along or all at once? No, for sure.

We'll get, um, so the failed transactions, for example, those are the number one priority. They'll be taken care of ASAP and pushed through ASAP. No question about that.

And then, um, the other bugs and additions will be after that's the failed transaction if they're taken care of. That's definitely the number one priority as far as the app goes. Yeah, Flute looks like you'll have to, uh, yeah, you'll have to find Ultra Suede.

All right. Has the task been revealed? No!

Where the heck have you been? You go on vacation and you come back and you just... The task has not been revealed.

No, the task will be revealed once we're live. No, if it was revealed, we'd be live. Are you going to reveal it prior to it going live?

No, most likely not. Most likely we will reveal it after we're live, but nothing's set in stone. You all know that.

So we are going live and saying F the task, but we don't know the task. No, when we're going live, that means task is live. I think it'll make more sense once we get there.

Is the task with us? No, just making everything up again. Yeah, super, uh, again, nobody wants us live more than I do.

Not even Boris, although he he's asking when he's, I think he's ready. But yeah, I think it'll be good. Thank you for all the...

Thank you for all the folks saying I'm making it all up. I think that's making, you know, our expectations a little lower, which will make task be even more phenomenal, I think. No, I think it'll be it'll be good and the time will be worth it all the wait, but to get everything we did completed was a big deal.

Many, many hoops to jump through and then to get it reviewed to make sure security is tip top. You guys see Antling? Yeah, Boris.

Boris is good. Scale of one to ten, how blown away we'll be with this task. I have to wait and see.

I'm just, you know, it's all I'm gonna say. I'm gonna say, uh, it'll make sense. It'll make sense why it took so long.

Who is Patriot Pig endorsing for a feature of the house? 45. I like that.

45 or 47. Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Who is hoping for a 10?

[Speaker 1]
I'll wait and have you guys decide. I can't put a number on it. I'll let you be the judges.

I think I've shared enough. You guys aren't, you're not stupid, most of you. Most of you are very bright, but yeah, I think it'll be great.

The team has worked very hard on this. And the devs have worked very, very hard on this. Tons and tons of hoops to jump before everything got completed.

The way we wanted with all the functions to help us be the most successful long-term in growing the community. Aw, you're welcome. Do you work at Chipotle?

Shira, Gibi? I used to love Chipotle. Going to do any weird shit tonight?

Are you talking to me? No, I just got home. We went out, had dinner at my favorite spot.

They just opened one, like two miles. Away from my house and that's just dangerous because I'm there every cheat day pretty much. And it's weird.

It's not like, it's not a very special plate. I don't know. I just love it.

Maybe the consistency. I don't know. It's kind of like In-N-Out.

In-N-Out is like my jam. Stop there, just like patties, mustard. I'm good.

Same with this place. Oh, that's so cute. I have four dogs, so I feel like I can do that.

I'd have to jump like different heights because I like bigger dogs, smaller dogs. That seems to be all the questions. We're still looking like we'll be live before Christmas, which is great news because I really want the gift cards and the merch and everything to be live.

I think Christmas is, I feel like a lot of people are broke after Christmas. I'm wondering if that's the same like in the conservatives versus like liberals on a chart. I'm not sure but yeah, we're still looking pretty solid before the end of the year.

Everything legal wise is getting squared away and just polished up with political donations. Definitely hoping, so far so good, so definitely hoping legal doesn't squash that. Any new events lined up?

No, we cannot apply to events until we're done, not with TASK, but at least our merch, so then we can have the events just at least be just like March 5th. Same with ATP USA call.

[Speaker 2]
I'll leave it on that to have another call with them.

[Speaker 1]
When we go live, are there any large merchants through BNB that will accept payments? Not yet. That would be amazing.

Definitely on the list of goals, but gotta get these first few steps first and then go from there. Why those memes are so funny. Deps are working through the weekend, so that's great.

Okay. Is Boris concerned about BNB rumors? Yeah, he's actually asked about that a few times, it's been a few months now.

[Speaker 2]
But yes, he's definitely concerned about that.

[Speaker 1]
And I'm assuming you mean BNB as in finance, not BNB as in Bannon and Morris. Everything, all the little details have been thought through. Ooh, nice level up.

Yeah, definitely. Yes, Boris first asked about that, gosh, a few months ago. Yep, yep, yep.

Every detail that I can think of has been thought through, which is partially why stuff's taking much longer than expected. But also a lot of stuff that we haven't seen done before all in one package, so that was the difficult part for the deps. Why they had to jump through so many hoops and so many third parties and so many platforms.

But again, it's finally all complete. Now we just gotta wait for the review. After review is complete, we do a second review, then make those modifications, and have it reviewed by the second reviewer again to make sure everything is done correctly to protect the coin, the community, and future holders.

Without merchants up front, this will be nothing more than a pump until it gains traction. Are we worried about mom and pops buying and just experiencing all the dumpers? We need slow growth.

Yes, it will definitely be gradual slow growth. We are not worried about the dumpers and the mom and pops merchants participating. We've thought all that through, every single detail, so you guys will see.

But yeah, any merchants, like the community members we've had reach out who want to accept FJB as a form of payment, again, we've thought of every detail to help. Of course, there's always, you know, pumping, dumping, you know, there's, we can't prevent that. That's just the nature of this, but we have done everything we can and thought up every detail that will help with that.

And make it make sense to merchants, make it make sense mostly for everybody. And yes, we obviously, we do want a slow growth because we don't want it to be an all-time high in one day and then, you know, just a dump down 90%. Oh, was there any part of the task that the team had to go back to B&B for approval not asking for specifics?

Yes. Absolutely. Uh, mostly B&B and legal.

Our attorney is definitely on my favorites list. And that'll continue, obviously, just making sure we do everything correctly. Which again, has taken a lot more time.

If we were just planning a pump and dump, we definitely wouldn't have taken months to get everything done correctly. I'm sure you all can probably see that. But I don't like you all being upset with me, so.

But again, we're doing everything we can to make this give us the highest level of success long term. Make this attractive to current holders and future holders. If we wanted to pump and dump, I imagine it would have been a lot easier to do than everything we've done.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Get your coins off XT, guys. If you still have coins on XT, please get them off, transferred off of XT into a trust wallet, into a MetaMask ASAP. If you need help with that, please email, DM, tag me so I can get you taken care of.

Again, XT has not given us a hard deadline, but we'd like to avoid any problems and just get your coins off there sooner than later. So please contact me if you need any help with that. Also, it seemed, who was it?

I think it was James. Seems like a fake trust wallet email was sent out. Be very careful of that.

PayPal has their own coin, and they're already an established payment system. How do we do better than that? Yeah, PayPal's woke.

And you can't really think that way either, because I mean, there's a ton of there's, you know, most everything. You can probably find an example if it's been thought out and done, but even if we had somebody exactly doing what we're doing, well, one, it probably would have been a lot easier for us to do seeing somebody else's example. But two, competition is a good thing.

I don't use PayPal, unless I have to. Somebody we were paying, though, said that they were gonna transfer their crypto to offering, but through PayPal.

[Speaker 2]
I've never done that, but what it says is PayPal.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder how PayPal is doing their coin. I haven't looked into that, but or any of their crypto stuff, because I know generally, well, I guess it's still going through PayPal. Because generally, they take, I think, the side of the buyer, and they have a ton of returns.

I don't think that's changed in the last year or so. It's pretty recent, or relatively recent info. Oh, did you guys see the thing of Hillary Clinton, her video, saying we all need to be deprogrammed?

All Trump supporters need to be deprogrammed. We were talking about that at dinner. Wild.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think a lot of people agree with you, MJ.

[Speaker 2]
Somebody is scattered. I haven't seen this. Crazy, crazy.

[Speaker 1]
All right, well, I think that's everything. Hopefully, our next several calls continue being very similar to this, for everything to just keep moving smoothly. Again, if we do end up being held up by something, I know it's for the best, and it's good that we're getting it reviewed and modified.

But I'm just hoping and praying that everything keeps going smoothly. I'll definitely keep you guys updated. Hopefully, the app transaction failed bug gets figured out sooner than later.

I know a few of you are wanting your funds transferred out of the app, so that is still the number one priority on the app front. And we have several devs working on it, so I will keep you updated on that. Uh, if you need anything, please feel free to email, DM, or tag me.

So I haven't been on Discord much the last few days, but it's been a few weeks that my notifications on there are pretty wonky. I don't know if I need to... I know they've been like that, I've told you guys, for a few weeks, but I will maybe uninstall and reinstall it.

I'm not sure. Telegram works fine, but Telegram is glitching another way, where it shows my messages as somebody else. That's a whole different issue, but at least my notifications work.

Russ says, buy more soon. He's gonna, not financial advice. You're welcome, Relish.

Okay, please get your coins off XT. Don't give anybody your seed phrase, or send anybody money, or click on any weird links, even if it looks like it's from me, or any of the other admins. Likely a scam, so please keep that in mind.

I feel like that hasn't happened for a while, so please, please, please don't do that. Even if you get an email like James did from Trust Wallet, asking you to do some weird stuff, you can contact Trust Wallet directly from your app. Probably the safe thing to do.

Or DM me, or ask in general chat too. Better to be safe than sorry, and lose your funds. So you all have a great night.

I will be in general chat. I'll post some notes in the recording right now. Give me a few minutes just to transfer that file and convert it, and I will get that posted.

Thank you all so much. Have a safe weekend, please. And again, let me know if there's anything you can help with.

Good night.
