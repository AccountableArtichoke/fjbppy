Hi guys, happy Friday, hope everybody's doing all right. I'm getting ready for the holidays. All right, let's get right to it. 

I've been getting a lot of questions. Unfortunately, I don't have any updates that I can share with you all right now. As soon as I have an update for you, I will get that to you.

We are shooting for a update by December 3rd for you all. I did get the final say from Boris, so I am just waiting on Steve now. Again, I will update you as soon as I am able to.

Trust me, I am not trying to keep anything from you. I have been getting a lot of DMs, emails, probably just with the bull run of a bunch of holders that had FJB wondering how they get their PPY now. So if you know any family friends, feel free to help them out with that. 

If they haven't contacted me, again, if they have their funds in the old app, they do need to have their old seed phrase to be able to access that. Yeah, I think that's all I have for now. Again, I will get you an update as soon as I possibly am able to share anything with you all.

Yeah, I hope you have a great Thanksgiving. If I get an update by then, before December 3rd, I will definitely share that with you all. But I'm personally thinking December 3rd just because it's almost impossible to reach anybody once it's super, super close to a holiday like next week. 

Again, just waiting on Steve right now. Again, if you all have any issues you're having with your wallets or anything like that, of course, still feel free to reach out. I am still handling all those tickets and emails and questions. 

I just unfortunately can't answer any other types of DMs, calls, or anything like that. All right, I hope you all have a great night, a great weekend. I will see you in general chat.
