[Speaker 1]
I hope everybody's doing well. I'm just hot as heck, triple digits, and humid. I left the house today to get a few groceries.

I try to get on before the timing, but I have a child here I have to feed for dinner. Okay, recorder's going. Alright, happy Friday, hope you've all had a great week.

Let's see, obviously you've seen the dump from yesterday. And then one of our holders, or previous holders, who's posted some stuff in the chats, I'm sure you're all aware of. This is somebody who has contacted me in the past week or so in DMs. Again, there's only so much we can say, because of course we want to stay professional and respectful to holders. But again, threats towards me or the business aren't going to go well. And also threatening or writing to tell me that I'm afraid of holders or a holder causing some sort of revolution. I think I spoke on that a little bit Tuesday, guys, that's not the way we operate.

We just don't negotiate with terrorists. We've talked about the tax over and over and over. You know, that is with volume, we definitely plan on lowering the tax.

But this tax has been here since we started, since the day, this is nothing new. Tax on FJP was there 8% since the day it was born. So it's just a few traders who want to trade.

That's understandable, everybody wants to make money. And unfortunately, those same traders who made great money are the same ones who left a lot of the loyal holders with the short end of the stick, really. So we'll continue to say and stick with our tax that has been here since day one.

No holder, you know, trying to cause a revolution or multiple holders now saying they want lower tax is not going to get us to change the tax currently. As much as we love you all, respect you all. That's not again, not how we operate.

So I do apologize for that. Again, one person kind of cascades into something else. Yeah, and price wise, the chart I saw the screenshot that was posted of PPI with Matic.

If you want to go ahead and that was for the last 24 hours that that person posted. If you want to go ahead and compare Matic against PPI for the last 90 days. It's a lot closer there.

We've seen most of crypto is down right now. Stocks are blood bath. So that's again, that's going to go up and down.

We don't make our decisions based on how the chart is doing. We're again what we've kept to our word from when I took over these specific responsibilities and we've stayed true to our word. And that's going to continue.

That's building a strong foundation, going from there, lowering tax once volume picks up. Again, going back to, you know, the one person who's saying, oh, I should put my own money into this project to keep it running. I've put a ton of my own money, a ton of my own time.

I'm not sure if any of you here would like to work for free. That's the case. Reach out.

But again, you know, sometimes one person causes a little cascade. So muting or banning people from the chats. Again, not because we hate you all, just because it's not for the best interest of the organization, of the community, of the holders.

And that's something, again, we'll say, stay true to our word and really continue to do what's in the best interest of everybody there. Again, that's not changing. We understand people will come and go.

People will sell. People will buy. People are getting tired of waiting.

This has been, again, I mean, through every step of the way, there's people tired of waiting, tired of waiting. Like, I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you. We're moving forward.

We've continued to move forward. Yeah, that's why we've stopped giving timelines for the most part. But yeah, sending threats or anything like that is definitely not going to have us change the direction we're going or is not going to impact decisions.

So just want to make that clear. And I'm sorry for, you know, kind of preaching to the choir for that. I know this is not a majority of you, but I think it's also important to address that so that you all who are not that very small minority, just so you kind of understand the gist of where that, you know, and of course, it's always the few loudest ones, just so everybody understands a little bit.

And I know we can only share so much to try to stay professional. But just sharing that with you all again, knowing this is not directed towards most of you, but just so most of you understand where we're at with that. And again, I've received what you all have received in some of the side chats.

I've received that in DMs earlier this week, again, you know, later in the week. So anyway, I think that's important to share with you all so you know where that's at. Again, we don't have a team.

We have a team with multiple people who have decades of combined decades of experience in this industry. And unlike the few holders who have their own best interest to make the quickest buck, the people we have on our team basically have the best interest of the organization and you all and aren't, again, these, the decisions they're making aren't, you know, so they could make a quick buck, even though that would be very easy for them to do. So that's who we've trusted.

And again, our goal is continues to be, I should say, to make a solid long term. And so far, I think we've done an excellent job. Things have taken longer than expected for the most part.

But again, that's starting to see that most industries, most of software development, most of crypto, even with the third parties we're dealing with. But we're also doing it right, which takes a lot longer than before, where we put constant band-aids on everything just to, you know, have a pump and dump voice chat and have everybody buy and again have everybody sell. So again, I think we've, I think our record speaks for itself if we want to go that way, as far as what we're building and what we're going to continue to build.

Unfortunately, again, people are going to sell, people are going to buy, you know, whales are going to empty out their wallets and create new whales. And this is something that volume, I think, will definitely take care of. So that's all that.

Again, I do apologize. I don't want you all to think this is directed towards most of you. Definitely not.

I just kind of want to make you aware that we are well aware and also make you understand where we're coming from, rather than, you know, these people just saying, remove the tax, remove the tax, we need volume. Again, a lot of these people are the ones that have profited heavily at the cost of many holders, unfortunately. And that's something we definitely don't want to continue.

And I think it's great if that's, you know, again, unfortunately, the charts suffer, but that's something temporary. And if you want to compare PPY against Matic, a little bit longer than the 24 hours, we're about even there. Moving on.

Devs did complete and we tested the escrow function of the app. It is working beautifully. So you all can go back to posting.

Actually, I want to make sure, too. For those of you that were receiving errors when you try to make a posting, a classified posting, that was actually just that your image is too large. So they'll just be an error message added to that so that you all are aware that it's just an excuse me, file size of your image issue.

So if you if you still are receiving that error again, just try a smaller image and that should work for you to post your product. And we'll continue that contest of anybody who posts a product will be entered to win. I think it's five hundred K.

Each item is an entry for classifieds. And what the what's really cool about the escrow function is this. Before I had asked you all to temporarily add your telegram or discord handle so people can, you know, make sure it's you and make sure no bad actors are just making an account in the app and posting something.

And now you guys paid on and never receive an item. So it's really cool. Now, basically what the escrow system does, in case you're not aware, is it holds the funds you send.

So a seller posts an item. You go as a buyer. You don't really need to check your homework to know who the seller is.

They don't need to include their handle or anything like that. You go buy the item. It is not going to send them those funds right away.

And then we have in our system a tracking where the seller can put the tracking info for the item so that admin and then both users know when the item arrives. And then there has to be some confirmation from the buyer that they receive the item. Obviously, happy with the item, i.e. it wasn't broken, it wasn't the wrong item, etc. And then the payment gets released. So that protects all of you. It protects us.

It's in the best interest of everybody. If there is an issue with a problem, then again, the funds don't get released. We try to solve that between the buyer and seller.

If it's either solved, again, the seller gets their payment or the payment gets refunded. So, that's really, really, really awesome. It was an important function to add on.

We didn't want to wait until one of you got scammed to take care of that. The other one is a change now. I know Good News Truth will be happy about.

We added that to the production app on your end. Now, if you try to purchase or swap over the change now limit, you will get an error message letting you know exactly what your limit is at, what the maximum is at, and to just try to swap under that limit. I think I already updated you that the direct on-ramp listing agreement has been signed.

So, yeah, that's very exciting. Again, it should be much, much, much sooner than expected. I don't want to give a date because I don't want you guys hounding me, but it is much closer than expected.

We are hoping it goes as planned as far as the time estimate for that. I will update you as soon as it's complete. Very excited for that and, again, very excited for the company that we are collaborating with for this.

Our new dev is doing great. Phenomenal, actually. Very happy with him.

He's working on something more back-end that you all really won't see. I don't know. Maybe Nolan and Farkas will.

And that's just the way we pull the prices for the price quotes and the chart in our app. We're just moving away from BigQuery. That's who we currently use.

So, again, most of you probably won't notice that. That's something a little bit on the back-end here. But that's what our newest dev is working on.

Other items that devs have now moved on to. Let me see. I know the third on the list was adding another feature to the gift cards to make that even easier for the recipients to redeem.

I found kind of, I don't know, a little bit of a, I don't know if it's a flaw, but.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, let me go into the chat. In other words.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. So, please, sellers. Farkas says, I have a lot to do with my free time.

Escrow orb. Yeah. So, please, sellers, don't post junk.

Make sure you pack things well so nothing gets broken on the way and we just prevent all that headache. I think when buyers and sellers know that their payment won't be, or when sellers, rather, know that their payment isn't going to be released until the buyer confirms and is happy, I think that'll also motivate everybody to just do better, be better, pack everything a little bit better because nobody wants their item broken and everybody wants the money that they sent for their item. So, I think that'll be good all around so that we're not doing orbs all day.

Any word on the auto-populating of the wallet address? Yes. Our dev is actually diving into that to see what else we can provide on Rampr to move a little bit quicker.

Sometimes, like with past third parties, it's nice when our team gets involved and helps out a little bit.

[Speaker 2]
So, direct on Rampr this week coming.

[Speaker 1]
I'll let you know as soon as it's live. But I will say it is what the estimate they've given us. Knock on wood.

Hoping it's not like past estimates from other third parties we've gotten where it's gone like four times that amount. Even if it's double that amount or triple or even honestly four times that amount or the time estimate they've given us, I think we should still be golden. And again, the fact that I'm excited to see how it works for most of you, most of our users.

But the fact that they are willing to learn our user base specifically and go off of that is really, really exciting. So, that'll be cool to see kind of how we navigate through that rather than just straight disabling accounts like we experienced before. Yes.

Good news. Truth is happy. That's all that matters.

Is it ETA? No. Okay, so that's some of the bad news I had today.

I had a talk to the coffee lady actually almost every day this week. That is going to be a little bit later. They had like a, it's actually a really, it's a local company, but they're actually big like this is exactly what they do.

But it's only, it's like a family owned business and they had like a death in the family. And anyway, unfortunately, she's telling me it's going to be more like two weeks. So, still within the month, but I'm hoping that, but I'd rather, I'd rather escrow and other software development be going as planned and the coffee be late than the other way around.

I'll take that. You guys would probably agree. K-cups are contributing to my microplastic consumption.

Yeah, I'm really bad with the Nespresso pods and I have way too many Nespresso machines. I wish I had like all that, you know, effort so early in the morning, but most of the time I don't. It's really bad.

[Speaker 2]
I still have two months of K-cups. Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 1]
Gave away my Keurig a while ago. I did like the hot water it was giving me. I ordered another electric kettle.

It's supposed to be on. Did you get to go to the Vance rally? Ah, so disappointed.

So, I told you guys it was quite a field trip. Um, it's, it was all, actually the way, the drive there wasn't terrible, like over an hour because it was before rush hour really started. So, the rally starts at six, doors open at three.

Picked up my niece. We headed over there. Got there at four and all the traffic signs had already said, uh, event at capacity.

And I'm like, I'm like, okay, it has to be the, um, parking maybe like at the, cause it was at a church. And it's a church I've never been to. I'm not really sure how large, uh, it was.

Um, and so then I asked the officers, there is stop, like as we're driving, obviously very slow through and ask him and he's like, no, I think it's just the parking. Well then, okay, that's fine. We go and park on the whatever side street in the neighborhood.

And I see some ladies walking back and I see a lot of people actually walking back as I'm driving too. But then I see these ladies like right there in the car in front of me going back to their car. So I asked him and they said, no, they turned them back at the door.

The event's already at capacity. So unfortunately, um, I think they held the event at a, uh, venue and it was the church, um, like much smaller. I don't think they, I think they really underestimated, um, how many people would show up for it to be full.

Like, I don't even know how long it took for, uh, it to be, to be at capacity. I mean, they've, you know, they had time to update the, uh, street signs and everything. So very unfortunate because, uh, we had everything, but yeah, by the time we got there, everybody was pissed off, uh, and hot walking back to their cars.

And then it took us over two hours to get home. So that was really fun. I got to spend some quality time with my niece.

So, um, and now we have a bunch of packed, uh, March ready to go. So hoping we have another rally in the next month here, but you know, it's always, they don't tell you until it's very close with security, uh, for security purposes, I imagine. Um, we'll also contact Boris to see if there's, um, uh, some sort of special, uh, passes we can get, uh, for something like that.

So that in case that happens again, that we are still able to get in. Uh, usually there's like media passes too, but this time I didn't see that for the Vance rally. So I'm not sure if that's, I missed it or, um, or if that just wasn't there this time around, but yep, yep, yep.

So yeah, very unfortunate, but we did not make it, but I am glad. I mean that so many people did and so many people are planning to go on a weekday. Um, is there any more development you can tell us about?

So, um, so let's see, we've got some backend stuff. Um, well, oh, that's what I was looking into. What did I say?

Um, there's something I'm missing. Uh, I told you guys about BitQuery. Uh, I think I already, actually going down the list, I think I've already shared with you guys on Tuesday, but just in case, uh, we have the social sharing feature, uh, which is just being able to share any, um, activity.

Say you, I don't know, bought a million PPY, you can go ahead and share that on your social media. Um, and then we go on to the points and badges, which is, uh, basically Patriots perks from there. Um, and at the rate we're going, yeah, it's only August 2nd.

Oh, shoot. It's my parents' anniversary. Do we need to get something for our parents' anniversary?

Um, okay. So, yeah, as far as we've been, knock on wood, everything development-wise has been going smoothly. Um, so smoothly.

Uh, so hoping it continues that way. Uh, we do have a few things that are third-party related. Um, obviously the auto-populate bug with the wallet address when you go to buy.

And some of the on-rampers will ask you to manually enter your, for example, MATIC wallet address. Um, but we know that's a third-party issue. Uh, and another, the other third-party will be the direct listing, uh, to integrate that into our wallet.

So, yeah, as far as, at least for the next month or so, a little bit of the, um, social media sharing integration. Um, and a little bit of the Patriot perks. Like, different aspect of it will, um, include third parties.

But honestly, those are nothing, should be nothing, uh, like finance-related. As far as, that's, that's where the bulk of, uh, rules and restrictions are. Um, everything else has been a piece of cake.

Going, uh, very smoothly. And hoping that stays that way. I will keep you all, um, updated on that.

Other products possibly coming soon? Yes. Um, also, reminder, if you all have friends or businesses that would like their products, uh, feel free to post those on.

Uh, with the dog products, we have those ready. We are just waiting on, uh, the bags, the stickers. Oh, I got a check, actually.

Said they were here, but I don't see them here. So, definitely, uh, expect those to be up by the end of the weekend. Now that we've got, uh, the escrow, uh, issue fixed.

And we needed to delete all the products on there. Um, I know some of you were having issues, uh, sending, uh, PPY, like for the coffee. Getting a failed transaction.

Um, we'll go back to testing that, uh, too. So, uh, we'll definitely have devs. That, uh, anything wallet related, um, we'll definitely take priority over everything else we have on the list.

It's really nice that now everything the devs are working on, um, obviously minus the, uh, direct on-ramp, which they're not working on yet. We have to wait. Um, but everything else is just a very nice to have.

Uh, so any bugs or anything that comes up in the direct, uh, wallet. As far as, like, the direct wallet. You know, buying, selling, swapping, purchasing, uh, something.

Uh, we'll take first priority. So, that'll be, that'll be nice, too.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that starts to keep stopping.

[Speaker 1]
Everything happens as it's meant to happen. I do believe that. I just, I really wanted to go to that, too.

Because I've never, um, I don't really know a lot about Vance. Um, obviously, I looked him up after, uh, his name was announced. But, it really was, and I imagine that's probably why there was such heavy traffic and so many people being, uh, turned down.

I, I imagine a lot of people are wanting to get to know him and what he's, uh, what he's about. Um, that's a swing state. They keep saying we're a swing state, but, ugh.

Maybe it's all the Californians and, uh, Illinoisans, I don't know, that have moved here. So many people from California. So many people from Washington, like Seattle, Washington.

And so many people from Chicago. Ugh. Marketing is planned to ramp up.

And, um, again, as soon as that, that, uh, on-ramper issue really is a big deal. Um, and again, bigger than we thought it would be, just because we don't want people copying and pasting the wrong, um, wallet. And then losing money, and people get really pissed off.

Um, and, and I understand, especially if you've never done crypto before, that's gonna be a very bitter, bitter taste in your mouth. Um, actually had a few people reach out in the last few days asking about different, uh, ways to pay, uh, to get crypto in their wallet. Uh, so hoping our direct on-ramp will also help with that.

Just cause, uh, I think I've shared with you guys before with the way, if you haven't noticed, with the way on-ramper works, it automatically picks your on-ramper. And then, you know, unless you get declined, then it'll move you on to the next one instead of letting you, uh, choose. And I think that's something they, uh, plan to change in the future.

Um, so that'll change too. Um, hopefully. Do you have a guesstimate on the on-ramper being fixed?

Um, I'm really hoping, I was hoping it would be by the end of this week. I'm hoping with our dev, our main dev, um, getting involved and trying to help them out, um, that, that'll be solved next week, I hope. Um, but again, don't take that, take that with a grain of salt or it just always sucks when it's an issue like the camera issue was.

[Speaker 3]
Have we received many emails?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, we will be, um, we'll be shutting down our FJB emails soon. I think we've, uh, you know, we've done over a year now, uh, with Patriot Pay. Uh, so hopefully we've given everybody ample time, um, and you know, the site's all redirect.

Uh, but just an FYI, if you have it in your address book or if you know anybody trying to contact us, um, we just don't want to continue wasting, uh, company money to pay for a bunch of FJB emails. Um, so we will be doing away with those by the end of the month. Um, again, just change it if you have it in your address book or anything like that.

Anything that's an at FJB, uh, dot, or what was it? FJBCoin.org. Yep.

So if you have the admin at FJBCoin.org or the Sarah at FJBCoin.org or any of the above, uh, just keep that in mind. Apparently they decided to just axe him and, uh, bring Kamala FKH.

[Speaker 2]
FJ who? I don't know who that is. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Anyway, so, it should be easy enough for anybody to contact us through the sites. Um, we'll also see, I know, I know Steve's, I know Steve's away. Um, that's so funny.

So I was talking to my niece because she, she saw the like business cards, right? That were taken. She's like, who's that?

With, um, Steve's face on them. And so I was telling her a little bit about it and she goes, um, oh shoot. I just lost my train of thought.

Saw a bug flying. Shoot. What was I going to share?

Ah, darn. Oh my gosh, Mike. There goes Mike with the cricket.

No, I've shared with you guys, I have my succulents in here. So sometimes, like, it's like this one, actually this one little bug. Now it's gone.

Shoot. What was I going to share with you guys? Oh, that's what I was going to share.

Um, so I was telling her that, she's like, oh, so is he going to be here? I'm like, no, he's in jail. And this is talking about Steve.

And then, um, you know, she goes on with a few questions because God bless her heart. She talks. She's not shy.

Um, and then she goes, oh, so do you think he's, and she's like, she loves her food. Right? Little chubby chub.

And she's like, so do you think he gets really good food in jail? It's like funny how a kid's brain works. I'm like, ah, I'm not sure.

I'd imagine he can probably buy his own food in jail. Um, but all to say, uh, we'll see if War Room, uh, if we can do anything before, um, Steve's out. That might be, might be a good way to do volume slow, slower.

Um, but I'll keep you guys, uh, updated. I miss Steve. Yeah, no kidding.

Energy. I remember when, when the weather allows, I would just put my, uh, AirPods on while I'm walking the dogs and, uh, listen. Get you fired up.

Gotten scammed recently, so that's always good. Keep your wallets to yourself. I feel like it always happens when our charts are just flying.

Wanting to track the scammers. Um, but again, as a reminder, don't connect your wallet to any sort of, any other coins or chats or anything like that. If it were me, I would just make a wallet with, you know, not much in it.

And, uh, you know, put your gas in there if you need to for whatever other coins. Um, and just use that. That way, if you connect your wallet and you lose what's in there, you know.

I'd rather use, or I'd rather lose 20 bucks or 100 bucks rather than hundreds or thousands of dollars. So, that's just an idea. Just to stay safe and just, you know, never know.

But, for sure, always just ask in the chats. We're always here to help. I haven't really been getting a lot of, well, I think, I think actually what it is is the, um, tickets I'm getting are not, not really tickets.

They've all been DMs or emails or for a lot easier fixes. Like, before we, um, had the Change Now, uh, error fix today for the Macs. Before we got that to you guys on the front end, somebody had DMed, like, uh, he was trying to purchase over the limit.

And kept getting that five, uh, things like that that are a lot quicker than what we went through with the fork. And, uh, with the app stuff. Um, contest will keep going until Sunday night.

I am, now that we got all the escrow things done, um, I am trying to get, uh, all your refunds for testing complete within this next coming week. Um, definitely want that before we start volume, start wanting to increase volume, um, anymore. Uh, again, we'll have the items listed in Marketplace and then, um, test with GOT.

See if you guys are still experiencing errors, um, with the way that goes. Uh, if you all continue to have errors, that's something that we'll definitely have to fix. That'll be, uh, high, high priority.

Devs have, uh, changed a few things, so hopefully that solves it for you all. But, again, we don't, we don't run into the errors on our end. That's why we all, uh, need you all to test with, uh, I don't know.

You guys, you guys find ways, or your devices find ways. You know, it's actually really strange. I don't know if anybody's techie here.

Um, so I tried sending, like, our, uh, work email, which is at patriotpay.org to someone several times through a text. And they were getting all my texts, but not the email address. Is that a thing?

And they kept thinking that I was ignoring their question to send them the email address. If anybody knows why that's happening. Uh, as soon as the autopopulate is, uh, fixed, we, excuse me, we have our, we almost have our, I should say, uh, ad ready to run for the TV network.

Um, this is for a program that streams on TV and on YouTube Rumble during rallies. Um, so the graphics, like, designs and everything that go on the screens, uh, are almost complete for that. Um, we'll just be waiting on the next rally.

I'm hoping we don't miss it. Like, I'm hoping, you know, we don't get news that we have a rally next Friday and the on-ramper, uh, isn't fixed. Uh, so that'll be, it's almost ready.

Uh, the emails are ready, ready, uh, for the mailing lists that I've mentioned before. Uh, and then we'll also be, uh, ramping up our social media, um, with educational videos. That's something we'll be, uh, starting to add to our social media.

Also, uh, not as far as even, again, I think we mentioned this before, not even as far as, uh, going into, like, how crypto works and all that. But the basics going as far as people thinking that the government can shut it off, where in reality, in my opinion, um, it's a lot easier for the government to shut off your bank account. Um, I was on the phone for an hour and a half this morning, um, with the bank because apparently they, uh, shut off, like, my online access.

Uh, because they said I didn't respond to, uh, like a fraud alert, but I did and I have the confirmation from them that I did. Uh, so they shut off the credit card and then all the accounts linked to it too. Um, so, uh, definitely looking forward to that.

Again, I think our biggest hurdle right now as far as marketing goes is, um, the auto-populate. Um, the direct on-ramp is nice to have just because it's one less step that, uh, buyers have to go through, but definitely not a, uh, we're not waiting for it. Although, hopefully, uh, they stick with their timeline.

If you watch, if you watch our wallets, uh, we will be making a payment to the, um, direct on-ramp company at, uh, I should say right before it's complete. So, I will say that. Very, very close to when everything's complete.

So, do, do what you will with that. And that payment will, will stand out. Some, some of it you guys will definitely see.

Yep, yep. That's definitely, um, highest priority. As any bugs that come up with the main, uh, wallet.

And of course the marketplace. And we'll, we'll continue adding some more names also actually to the donations too, but that's, again, the devs have done their work there. So, it's, uh, everything else is a piece of cake there as far as that goes.

Just hoping all the development stuff, uh, keeps going smooth, smooth sailing. MP, you're the last person I would give a date to. Okay, maybe not the last.

Very close, I will say that. And you will see, you will see a, not a typical payment from the wallets once we are, like, once we are much, much, much closer. That, that's what I'll say.

Definitely, again, with the timeline they've given us, uh, definitely within this quarter. Um, even if they end up going four times, uh, the time they've estimated. So, just, just hoping it keeps going the way it's going.

Very excited about that. Rainman? Wait, how do you know who Rainman is?

Are you talking about Fuego? I'm only assuming. I don't think he was crazy about timelines.

I think he was just crazy about other things. Bless his heart. Fuego is a nice guy.

For the most part. Is payment in PPY? No.

Actually, I will need, let me do that, I just haven't made time. We do have to off-ramp. We're waiting for our bank account.

I actually got the, uh, IRS doc I was waiting for. I need to scan that tonight and send it over.

[Speaker 2]
So that we can pay some bills. I'm adaptable sometimes. Oh, the movie.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I was talking about, uh, I don't know if anybody remembers, Rainman from Discord. I'm not a big movie, like, RTP person whatsoever. Which is kind of driving me nuts, because my niece being over here has TV on.

And just, sometimes the sound is even just, like, so chaotic. I don't know, what's the matter into TV? Not my thing.

I kind of wish I was. I can, like, just maybe de-stress and get lost into something. So, alright, let's recap.

So this week, um, we'll have, I'm hoping by the end of the weekend we should have all the marketplace listings that we have so far. Um, relisted. Some of them will be pre-orders.

If I don't have them here, they'll definitely be pre-order, even if I know when they're coming in. Shark Tank product will definitely be going on there. I wonder if the photo size for that one will be okay.

Devs, the bit query again, I know that's on the back end, but that should be completed by, complete? Completed by Tuesday. Um, so, hoping that the on-ramper issue will be taken care of with the auto-populate, the wallet address.

And then we'll, um, have, I'll do a little bit more testing now that everything is live on the production side of the classifieds, just so, um, we don't run into errors when you all post items. So, probably, I'll try to get as much testing as I can done this weekend on my end. We'll go from there.

Try to upload some educational videos too. And then our social media will definitely come back to life this coming week. Yeah, we'll see, uh, I'm hoping now that we're getting closer to the elections with the 30 day, or 90 days, three, I was thinking three months, um, that we'll have a few more rallies.

And, um, oh, sorry, this is what popped up with the rallies and giving away gift cards. Um, we'll definitely, we'll definitely travel. We're not, uh, closed off to just Arizona rallies.

But the, uh, that's something else I know I mentioned earlier in the call that the devs will be working on, um, is just adding a feature that just makes it easier for the recipient of a gift card to redeem. Uh, just taking off one more step, um, so that all they do is scan, redeem. Uh, we'll definitely get that done along with just a bunch of merch, basically, uh, to give away.

I think that's everything on my end. I will keep you all updated. Uh, if I have any updates beforehand, um, let me know if you guys need anything else.

Again, uh, you know, to email, text, call in, uh, yeah, for anything that you need. And I will also update you on the, um, War Room stuff too, actually, as soon as I can. I already updated you guys on what I can with some of the legal stuff.

Yeah, I think that's all I got, folks. Um, again, we have the buy contest running until Sunday night, um, pretty much midnight Eastern. And we still have the buy contest running that will keep running for, uh, any item you list in classifieds is an entry to win 500k.

There is no minimum on that. Um, so, we'll actually see, see what I can post. Maybe I'll start posting, uh, I'll start purchasing items for contests.

Um, items that I can mail you all. Uh, but yeah, other than that, we'll, uh, probably, so once the, um, once we have the OnRamper, uh, auto-populate complete, we'll do some kind of testing contest to just have you all, like, volume test the heck out of the app. Um, and we'll, we'll definitely reimburse you in some way.

Um, we, we definitely just want to stress test the heck out of the app. Uh, just kind of how we did, uh, right after the fork with the contract. And, uh, that worked great for you all to, uh, help us modify that contract that we keep modifying.

I'm never going to not be fascinated by that every time we do it. So cool. Definitely, definitely worth the time.

Um, and all the, uh, pushbacks we had in timelines to have that feature now, and just not need to go the, uh, through the mess of a fork. Um, even if a modification is, like, not the biggest modification, but we don't have to be like, oh, now we have to fork for this modification. Okay, that's not worth it.

Um, even the slightest modification, we just go through and, uh, change it, which was amazing. Um, so on that note, I hope you all have a great night. I will, uh, post this, um, recording right now.

Just give me a few minutes to type up some notes. First, I'll have to make sure that my niece didn't burn the house down. Um, and then I'll come back to do that and post it for you all.

Um, thank you for the prayer, all for his glory. Appreciate that. Thank you all.

Um, I'll see you in the final chat.
