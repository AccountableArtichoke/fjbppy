Okay, I think that's all set. Yeah, who is Flash? All you guys with your alts.

But I just saw Flash today so I haven't guessed whose alt that is. Okay, I hope everybody had a great weekend. Just the updates from the devs.

He has been testing since we all last met last Friday. Everything's going well on that side. He's just been working on the last day and a half or so on one particular function.

Actually, it has the same purpose, but it's two functions that serve the same purpose. And that's where he's at right now. That's what he's testing, just to make sure that fees stay very low.

He was having an issue with that and fees just being super high. So that's what he's been working on. I will keep you all updated.

As recent as the last hour, he says that it's just testing. Probably like 20 to 30% of testing left. So hopefully we'll be done pretty soon.

I do appreciate your patience. As always, I think everybody's been a little bit calmer. But I will keep you updated with anything else as soon as I get the updates from him.

Yeah, and this feature in particular I think will be great for holders in particular. And I think you guys will, most of you, will absolutely love it. It's really to prevent...we'll discuss after everything's announced, but it is a super cool two features. Any questions? I don't think I've gotten any questions in my DMs. I don't see anything. If he did DM me something, just send something so it goes to the top of my inbox.

What's the chance of completing before next voice chat? As far as testing, I'm honestly not sure. I will update you as soon as I know.

He has completed testing for everything else. So your pronoun for the developer is him. Is he a biological male?

You know, I've not asked myself, but I'm assuming. You know, I think the rest of the world still goes by chromosomes. I think we're the only insane country that is trying to do otherwise.

Is everybody busy with that crap? Having my azivia and a margarita. I think on like announcement day, I will finally have margaritas again during voice.

If the dev finishes in the next 48 hours, does that give the team time to reveal this task? Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Yes, that should be as long as the third parties still go by the time estimates that they've given us.

As you know, we don't have control over that, so and you guys have seen how third parties go. So they've given us certain time estimates and unfortunately, if you know, they don't follow through with that, then we can't go live. But that's, they can't start that until dev's work is complete.

I hope that makes sense. Let me know if it doesn't. What we've gotten from them, the time estimates they've given us, if dev does wrap it up in the next two days or so, we should still be good.

But I think, yeah. Still doing well. Testing went much better than the last time we went through this.

So unless we get some, which is still possible, you know, if we come to go live and, I don't know, something crazy happens, then I will definitely keep you all updated. But so far, dev says everything is going as planned. Like I said, the only issue was the high fees for certain features, and he's working on that.

I'm sure whenever we do go live, and I wish I had a date, it'll definitely be worth it. So I know I'm excited for that day. Probably more excited than you all are to finally prove to everybody that the dev was working, I promise.

How long after the task goes live is the white paper roadmap released? The roadmap will be very, very quickly, because there's not much on there that needs to change. The white paper, I don't know, give it, I'd say less than 48 hours probably.

And that's only because of changes. But still kind of not finalized. We were changing that with every change that the dev was making, and then it was a lot of wasted time.

So I think I will just wait until the dev is done. Thank you guys for your patience, too. I know tonight, I know it's very, very late where most of you all are.

It's only 6.39 here, but I would have usually done it earlier than usual today, but I wanted to make sure I had the most up-to-date information. Why is Discord always inappropriate? Ew.

The beer is made from recycled shower water, Mike wrote. At least it's not bugs, though. Fees related to a reflection type payout?

No. But I will share with you all what it is as soon as we go live. To reflection, start with the task going live.

So I don't know if you all have seen the changes, well, at least in the US, with reflections. Basically, we're trying to stay away from those because of more recent news from the SEC. I think it was when the Ripple, I think it came with the Ripple XRP, uh, settlement.

But that's where we're at with that. Burn instead of reflection? Yeah, I mean, we've burned what?

We've burned everything we're supposed to. I know I've gotten a few DMs about that, I think, of people who do holders, but I don't know. For some reason, I feel we haven't burned all the coins that were supposed to be burned, but I'm pretty sure they haven't.

SEC always here for your better interests, yeah. Okay, but yeah, that's it. That's all I got.

Again, if I get update before Friday, I will update you, of course. In the meantime, let me know if you need anything or have any questions. I haven't seen the scammers pretending to be one of the admins again, but as always, please make sure you don't click on any weird links.

There was another scam, what was it yesterday or day before? What was it? Somebody mentioned.

I don't remember now off the top of my head, but either way, don't share your seed phrase or click on any links from admins or send us money. Most likely, it's not one of us. Okay, you all have a great night.

I will get a recording up in case anybody needs to listen to it. Just give me a few minutes. I'll do that before I get to dinner.

Yeah, I'll see you guys in general chat. Thank you again. Have a great night.
