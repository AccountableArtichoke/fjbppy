(0:00 - 0:23)
I hope everybody had a wonderful Thanksgiving. I just wanted to jump on here tonight and update everybody in case you haven't gotten on our app or the web browser, whichever you prefer. I hope you... Give me just a second here.

(0:25 - 2:16)
I want to make sure the recorder is going. Okay, so if you haven't checked out the app either on your mobile app or the browser, probably a good time to do so. I know a lot of you have had lots of issues logging in or you get a new phone and then you have issue accessing your account. 

A lot of us have had the circle of death and the list goes on. So I hope you're able to log on and see how much easier we've made the process for all users. Super, super cool. 

So now you can log on whether you've got in a new browser, whether you've just deleted everything on your phone, you can go ahead and recover your account with just your seed phrase. So of course, please, if you haven't written down your seed phrase and store it in a super safe place, I would highly recommend doing that. Not somewhere like your email, but I would highly recommend writing that on a piece of paper and maybe putting that in a fire safe box. 

But with that, you can still get all your VEST redundancies set up, which gives us a great advantage over other wallets like Trust Wallet. Because say you do, I don't know, for whatever reason, you misplace your seed phrase and you get a new device and now you can't get into your account. If you have your redundancies set up, whether that's other friends or other browsers, you can go ahead and still get into your account and access your funds.

(2:18 - 3:51)
So that's great news. If you have any issues, I think Ed, thank you, Ed just finished getting, who was it in Telegram? I'm sorry, you all. Cajundog. 

I know he just helped him figure that out in the past few hours here. Sorry, I was on the road. So I appreciate the admins taking care of everybody today. 

And I think I saw Kindling Violets got that sorted out earlier today. Everybody else, I've not gotten any other issues. If you are running into other issues, please let us know. 

Let me or any of the admins know. Email, DM, tag us and we'll take care of you. But I think everybody should be set now. 

I know a few of you haven't had access to your accounts for months and now have finally have access to your accounts. So that's great news. And other great news, all of your transactions in the app should be successful now. 

If you are still having trouble getting funds out of your wallet or off ramping, please DM me, tag or email, just contact me anyway, text, call. So we can get you taken care of. I know several of you have already off ramped funds straight to your bank account and I'm being told it's taking less than five minutes to get it all the way from the app to bank account.

(3:51 - 4:12)
So if you are still having issues, please let me know so we can figure that out. We are aware of all the other little app bugs. I know the buttons are not showing. 

I know the trade button. I know the button on the buying page. Those were actually fixed and then we just had dev teams overlapping.

(4:13 - 4:20)
So it backtracked. I think it was Thanksgiving Eve. So we'll get that back updated on the app.

(4:20 - 5:15)
No worries. Same goes for the box on top to hide the zero balances, zero balance coins. So we have some more great updates coming with the app. 

I think you guys will love them. And also some fixes. I know some of you are sharing some issues with the app that we've had for a very long time. 

Just the way the app is just set up essentially. Like the bitcoin receiving address, a few other ones. But those are on the list for us to get the app all ready for you and just make it truly more user friendly, easy enough for your grandma to use. 

So very excited about that. We are closer as of this morning to announcing the task. We are still good for November.

(5:16 - 6:00)
I should know more this weekend and that'll be Saturday or Sunday. But I will keep you updated as far as that goes. Again right as of now we are still good for November. 

But I will let you know if that changes. I should know by the end of the weekend for sure. But again yeah we'll keep you updated. 

Any questions? I don't think I was in and out of service for the last few hours. Getting back home. So let me check my DMs.

(6:02 - 6:22)
I don't think I have any questions in here. We did update the app support channel in Discord. So feel free to use that if you need anything else.

(6:25 - 7:40)
TPUSA good for booth not just PressPass. That's depending on the task. Actually some of it on the app too. 

Some app integration there too. But this weekend by the end of this weekend I should have a lot more info. How's everybody? Is everybody able to log into their app? Is everybody able to recover their funds? Task that shop. 

When will our logo change to Patriot Pay? That's in the process. I'm assuming you're talking about app especially but also for all the other sites we're on. More room in December? I'm not sure of that yet.

(7:40 - 8:27)
That highly depends on when our task is completed. What are some of the first coins you might be adding when you do add? I'm assuming to the app. I think that depends on where we are in app phases basically and what's hot but the list definitely is going to go from most popular. 

I don't know. We don't have Finn anymore. He was really wanting Dodge on there but I'm not sure how relevant Dodge coin still is.

(8:29 - 9:18)
App is launch ready? Not quite. There's still a few bugs. Again most of them are ones that were already worked out. 

What the devs have actively been working on is getting the tax estimation. The tax estimation hasn't really been perfected from never throughout the app's lifetime. That's something we've been working on even when Velo was around and something that needs to be continuously changed, modified but they've been working on that just to make sure and this is primarily for a smart wallet because your gas is being calculated on the back end.

(9:19 - 9:40)
Basically just to find that sweet spot where we're not charging you too much but we're also not paying for your gas. That's mainly what they're working on right now as a highest priority on the app. Task to be revealed this month? Right now we're still good.

(9:40 - 12:18)
By the end of the weekend I should definitely know more and that's from our third party. Still not sure about TPUSA in December. TPUSA depends highly on task and app because we want the users to have the app available and ready. 

I don't think there's any use for us to spend the funds if we don't have the app user ready. Ronnie is a winner. Ronnie is so clever. 

Oh why is Bob dumb? What happened? Some new drama I don't know about. Be nice. Anything else? Get your funds off. 

XT please get your funds off LBANK and get your funds off WIRE. If you need any help with that please reach out to me. Again DMs, email, tag me, call, text any way you need to so we can get you taken care of. 

If you do not move your funds out of LBANK or XT or WIRE we can no longer help you if they just are done delisting us and say they don't have your coins anymore. So please do that and tell anybody you know who might be holding coins on any of those sites. Again that goes for XT, LBANK. 

I know XT. I think I've given you guys this notice for several months now. For LBANK we announced this for a few weeks now but definitely get your coins off there and WIRE you have till December 3rd. 

The other two have not given us a hard deadline but I wouldn't be surprised if it's tomorrow. So just get your coins off there, transfer them to the app address or trust wallet address and you will not be charged the eight percent from transferring your coins. If it's from XT or LBANK you're not going to be charged the eight percent so please don't worry about that. 

Just get them over otherwise you are at risk of losing your funds and we are not responsible for that. Let me know if you need any help doing that. I'll help you.

(12:24 - 13:48)
Probit we've been delisted for a very long time so I'm not sure how many coins are even left on there. But yeah Probit we've been done there for a while. I think they're just nicer. 

They're smaller exchange so but yeah that's been a while. Will the name on exchanges where highlighted change from Freedom Jobs Business to Patriot Payers at Permanently Staying Freedom Jobs Business? So that Freedom Jobs Business can um actually uh let me check on that because that should be the uh Let's Go Brandon but somehow that was changed without forking so that's something we can likely most likely change to Patriot Pay. Okay let's get Abligma certified. 

Is that right? On a one to ten scale what's your level of confidence for task reveal? Are you trying to get me in trouble? Um no I honestly have no clue right now. This weekend we will definitely find out. Uh at this point it's not in our hands that's all I can say.

(13:52 - 14:29)
But they can either pull through which I'm hoping for um but I will keep you guys updated by the end of this weekend or I'll keep you updated if I get good news beforehand. But from our end everything is beautiful. How long after task reveal before new socials will be up and running? At task reveal.

(14:31 - 15:20)
Right then and there. Thank you Fizz. Appreciate it. 

Yeah the Freedom Jobs Business we can change. It's the Let's Go Brandon and the FJB ticker that we cannot change until we fork. And even the app. 

The app is in the process of changing and switching over. They just need the LLCs to make sure that that name needs to match the LLC. After task reveal how long to release the white paper? The white paper will be almost immediately.

(15:20 - 15:58)
Uh the roadmap will likely take longer than the white paper just because we have some agreements. Or we can still release a roadmap with without some specifics. But the white paper will be almost immediate as of right now. 

That is the plan. But everybody looking at Telegram. Everybody seems pretty happy with the app.

(16:00 - 16:37)
I think we definitely appreciate your patience getting to that step. But I think everybody seems ecstatic. Not much. 

I don't see much feedback with the app on Discord. I don't know if most of you have moved to Telegram. Nothing even in the uh support. 

I know I um I know I started a new app support channel just because our other one. Oh most everything in there didn't apply anymore. Any of the bugs.

(16:37 - 16:53)
So I think the only one was all for his glory and I tagged her in Telegram. She said she's longer experiencing her issue with the Facebook browsers popping up. But other than that I think most of you have been really busy in the Telegram app support.

(16:59 - 21:00)
Where is Don? Oh where is Weg? I don't know where Weg is. So Pat who has had issues getting funds off app can get them off now. He should be able to. 

I've not spoken to him. If he's still having an issue uh feel free to contact me. I know several people who have been trying to off-ramp did. 

I'm told within less than five minutes to get those funds to your bank account. So I am not I've not heard of any unsuccessful transactions on the front end other than us testing. So if you are trying a transaction and it's not successful please reach out to me so we can uh check that out. 

Are there swaps that we should stay away from? I'm not sure what you mean by that. Ethereum has very high gas fees right now so I probably wouldn't mess with that but technical difficulties uh no if you guys do have any issues please let us know. If you have any issues with any failed transactions but as far as I know and everybody I'm hearing from everything is successful. 

We're having unsuccessful transactions on the back end but that's more to do with us working out the gas. I'm not aware of any transaction that is not succeeding in the app but let me know if you do run into that so we can get that fixed. Let me see I haven't gone haven't logged into the app for and I keep now I keep typing a paytrip pay to find the app too on my phone. 

Let's see I didn't know there was a Ronnie and Bob feud. When did that start? I'm not hearing anything else so I'm assuming that everybody uh is able to get into their app and access it. Five minutes ago like this is new beef. 

I'm seeing it play out live. Ronnie and Ronnie and Bob. Why? I thought everybody would be happy. 

Everybody is happy to finally access their app and not have the circle of death spinning and get to their funds and both expert and smart wallet. Oh by the way if I know several of you have had this issue so in case you get on the app and you're seeing less coins than you thought you have it is because the balances are separated now your expert wallet and your smart wallet. So make sure you go to the bottom of your page in the app or the browser and switch that toggle to see both wallets and the balance of each wallet separately.

(21:02 - 21:33)
Again the expert mode wallet acts like trust wallet does like a traditional wallet where you will need to have your own gas. So if you need to move FJB you're going to need some gas in BNB. With the smart wallet you do not need to have that gas in there and the smart wallet will automatically do the work on the back end and charge you a little bit extra of that FJB at the end of your transaction.

(21:40 - 22:00)
Oh Ronnie might need a hug. I'll give you a hug Ronnie. I like them separated but could dev add a running total? Yes definitely I've heard that from a few people I think that's a great idea we've added to the list of app features to add.

(22:02 - 22:29)
I think somewhere on there we could have another total or something like that. Some of you like your total balance. Will other tokens get the withdraw button matching that trust wallet supports? Yes so since we do everything well in the app the withdraw is through Transac.

(22:30 - 23:04)
It's going to highly depend on what we can do with Transac but yes. How long before we find out who our initial social media influencers will be? I'll find out when I I'll let you know when I find out how about that. But I don't know if anybody would be a better influencer than Bannon himself.

(23:07 - 23:29)
I'm not a fan of that guy. I guess it's surprising me that anybody is he just I look at him and it's Obama and it just it just you know just drives me right up. Yeah I meant Transac yes absolutely.

(23:30 - 24:06)
Yeah since we have Transac and ChangeNow both integrated in the app we are definitely able to add all those features. Of course we'll continue making the app better but you know we got to start somewhere and that's why adding the logins using your seed phrase I think was very important. I know a ton of you were having issues and we heard that over and over and over so I think trying to make the app as easy and user-friendly as possible I think that was the first thing we needed to do.

(24:08 - 24:29)
And then now we can continue building on it. Did you want airstrike 2.0? God Jayrock you're gonna give me trauma. It's like major PTSD.

(24:32 - 25:12)
Why do you have to do that? What withdraw tabs are working right now? I don't know of any withdraw tabs that are not working. So and I just I just got back home so I will be doing some testing with the devs. My app actually has not been working for a few months so I can finally now log in and test everything which I will do with you all and to help the devs out too.

(25:13 - 25:41)
Now that I can log in with just my seed phrase. When will we be informed of any new potential project partnerships? I will let you guys know as soon as I find out. I feel like we the people is asking questions for Ed.

(25:42 - 26:08)
Like Ed forwarded him a list of questions. So if we withdraw do we get a card or does it go to a bank account? So you can withdraw straight to your bank account but I did see that Transact does have a card now. I saw that yesterday I think.

(26:09 - 51:45)
I haven't looked into that yet. I was uh I was busy cooking and a few calls yesterday actually getting you guys all set up on your apps. For me I'm back into the card. 

Transact had on file. Oh nice. Public Square sounds like a great business. 

Do you think we will be a part of their flap? We are listed on there as Freedom Jobs Business. We are updating that to Patriot Pay of course. So we have an off-ramp now. 

Well we always had so I'm assuming you're referring to when Transact was adding the off-ramp to FJB earlier this year and it was supposed to go live earlier this year and then um there's just basically there's more hoops they had to jump through than they imagined so they're still working on that and it's just a lot of certifications they need to get past before they can off-ramp in the U.S. but that's not to say you can't off-ramp BNB. So yes we always had that feature where you can go in the app from FJB to BNB to uh let's see you or you can well you can even go from uh FJ you should be able to go from FJB let's see to USDT this is where I need to uh get on the app now that I can finally access my accounts um but basically you just can't off-ramp straight FJB um and that's what they were working on earlier this year so you can still and we always have had the ability to off-ramp other coins so you just have to swap FJB to something else and then you off-ramp it. BNB, USDT, probably BNB probably as less gas is necessary for that. 

Can you summarize the steps remaining for app to be launch ready? Um definitely our login process um so far I'm thinking after we took care of uh Kindling Violets and Cajun Dog we should I think everybody so far but of course we'll have the people come and join probably this coming week that just aren't here as often as you regulars are um so hopefully that's squared away as far as the login process uh which was a major step after that is getting our app bugs um fixed again most of those just need to be pushed through again and actually have been fixed um and then to straighten out our gas situation just to get that a little bit more accurate so we're not charging you too much um you're not paying you know double the gas that you're supposed to to just use the smart wallet but also so you're not paying too little so then that defeats the purpose and we don't want to use all the uh transaction taxes to pay for your gas on the smart wallet we'd rather uh put those to the side to use for marketing or to continue improving the app so of course right there and then um yeah the task uh will need to somewhat be integrated into the app too you might want to send an email to all you have on file to get people onboarded to the app yes an email with the app we're just trying to get everything we can all the bugs worked out uh to send out that email also to remind you all and all your friends and all your co-workers and your family members to get any funds you have off transferred off xt l bank and wire and i just want to clarify with wire you guys shouldn't have any coins on there i want to make that clear okay um it's just some users paid wire from their bank account say the three hundred and then that's when we got deplatformed so they did not receive their coins from that three hundred dollars or two hundred dollars or whatever they paid um that's the only way you'll need to request that's the only reason you'll need to request a refund from wire i want to clarify that wire did not take your coin you know if you paid for your coins then you received your coins in the app there was no way that wire came in and withdrew your coins logo for app to be updated at apple android stores yes yes the logo and the app name will change from freedom jobs business to patriot pay i think it looks a lot better i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know anything else god i was so exhausted i had to get caffeine as soon as i got got home like what an hour ago now i need to go get dinner before before all my uh devs start their day if task is oh i'm sorry what protein did you eat for thanksgiving ham turkey or something else uh we actually went so we were up north um and we actually went to the neighbors they just invited us over so we went there um i made lamb and then what else did i make i made uh deviled eggs with smoked salmon and i made one more thing oh and i made a brussels sprouts with the pancetta what else um pistachios shaped parmesan and like a white uh vinaigrette white wine vinaigrette or white champagne champagne vinaigrette dressing sorry and then she made corniche hens so actually i didn't have turkey which i love turkey and i have one in the freezer that i got last week so i'll probably do that this week and i ate vegetables which i don't usually do but i felt rude i think i put a picture of my plate in the uh in the cooking channel on telegram if task is completed with third party but app not ready for launch will you still reveal task yes absolutely 100 percent however if task is completed with third party but apps not ready i don't think tp usa will be a good idea this year and um that's not to say so even if we don't even if patriot pay doesn't uh make tp usa amerifest this year which again we do have the press pass we will be there but you know booth um there's actually a ton of opportunities for all their events that they run at schools and universities and um so we'll see how that works we just don't want to spend um five figures to be at tp usa and it just be a whole you know a complete bust um their other events are you know their weekly events or bi-weekly events that they have um just ongoing all year round um are quite a bit less expensive and we can do you know for the price of amerifest we can do several um more of the college events um so yeah i think that answers that question if task is complete with third party but apps not ready we will still launch the task dev giving any guidance as to the step needed to be launch ready uh doing for the app sorry i don't understand that uh yes so we need we need the task to be integrated in the app and um the devs can only do that after the task is complete um which is why my confidence that the app will be ready by well and it's not even you know it needs to be ready before like well before tp usa which is on the 16th um my confidence in that has decreased a bit this week um for that reason i don't want to uh pay i don't want it to be like a war room wire day you know where we pitch everything out and everybody starts and then the app just breaks on us or the app isn't even ready so we'd like to uh wisely spend uh that marketing money paid by your hard-earned money the video is looking great uh for task release although i'm not liking the voiceover so we're having a few edits with that okay and i i really don't want to do the voiceover i feel like if i if i don't get to like this voiceover i'm gonna ask one of you guys which one of you guys has like the radio voice who did the video a contractor third-party contractor let me check the email since i've not been at my desk since noon make sure none of you passed anything there let's see i don't see anything our website will also be getting some awesome updates just gotta let's see yeah i got nothing okay all right anything else i am very thankful for our admins that have been helping everybody with their app login issues so shout out to all the admins i think dev was or ed was getting on the phone with people i'm gonna start forwarding ed all my calls all the fjb calls and texts confidence in november task reveal we are still within november i will know i should know for sure this weekend but at this point it is we have released it so at this point it's uh out of our hands but i will update you i should have an update by the end of this weekend we are getting um we're getting much closer which is uh great i will be a little disappointed if we can't make it in november because of what that means for the app and tp usa mainly but again i don't want to think about that while we're still in the weekend we'll see that's the cost of adding all the features we wanted to add and making it a lot more complicated than the traditional or standard task out there so i'll i'll take it uh i'll take that trade off as frustrating as it has been sometimes j rock this is wrong chat all right um does the app make a small amount from processing the smart wallet transfers no it should not you should i mean actually up to this point we've actually been losing because the gas fees have been so off that we've actually essentially been paying for users or a portion of users gas fees but no the idea behind the smart wallet the whole smart wallet idea is definitely not for us to make a portion of that it's just to make the app very very user friendly and not have you know users have to think about or figure out or even know about what gas is or what you know i'm needing gas and what kind what gas they need to have for specific transaction and just to not have that headache i think our app is we're definitely over a hundred thousand dollars um and app costs as much as as far as how much has been invested to get the app where it is today um so there's been a ton of resources a ton of dev time put in there we just just gotta clean it up a little bit but the devs do think the smart wallet gas issue cost is fixable yes they've been just trying to get to that sweet spot because um you know charging too much and charging users too much we we don't want to charge you you know it's going to be the smart wallet to use a smart wallet you will be paying a little bit of a premium because of what all the work that's done on the back end um and the agent contract and the basically the freedom factory is what handles all of our gas um so it's going to cost more than the expert mode wallet um but we don't want to charge you so much that we are making money off of it and that you're losing out on that money so it's just uh it's definitely fixable it's just finding that a sweet spot oh egg shut up i thought egg would go away after all the deviled eggs i made yesterday so yes devs are working on perfecting that gas issue to make sure you're not being charged too much but we're also not paying for your transactions finding that little sweet spot um other than that all your well most of your bugs on the app um they'll push that through again it was those issues were fixed for i think like 12 hours so they'll push that through so those are fixed and then after that i'll keep and please let me know if you if you guys see something that doesn't look quite right please let me know that that is always super helpful i'm only one person and the devs uh only a few of them and sometimes you know different bugs happen on different operating systems uh devices uh browsers etc so a lot of these issues look fine on my end or on the devs end but it's very helpful to have you all report the issues you're experiencing always uh send me a screenshot too if you could fingers crossed for good news this week weekend then yes i hope so will advisor be revealed after task reveal uh no advisor is a hundred percent anonymous that was a deal you guys think anybody wants to be revealed after the some of the stuff i've dealt with hmm ronnie's back ronnie i thought you left confirmed finn is the advisor no finn is not but finn's finn's still uh around he's doing very well i love him he's not amazing great guy okay would we have heard of the advisor before they weren't anonymous probably not unless you're less than you're in bnb's circle i guess but i have not so i assume most have not grant as an advisor oh gosh trauma why are you doing that jayrock egghead talked with him recently with advisor i don't think you know the advisors are bnb ready for task reveal yes actually i didn't um i haven't let boris in on the on all the cool uh app changes didn't want to bother him on thanksgiving eve but i'm sure he's going to be very very excited for that easy enough so not famous no the advisor is not famous but he is uh brilliant and uh very nice person just like finn the egg he talked with finn recently and it's awesome finn minh all right let's see do we have anything in app support oh we do have some more to catch up on the mods have been mods have been busy in there i see i'll catch up on there as soon as i get off the call anything else i think that wraps up everything i'm glad everybody's app from what i know is working if you are trying to perform any transaction and it's not successful please let me know send me a screenshot and uh yeah we'll go from there to see what's happening there and figure that out for you again please get your funds off xt off l bank and wire if you still have any funds with them again do that as soon as possible tell anybody you know who has funds on there we won't be able to help you once they pull that off so um ah thanks jrock always always fun here um but yeah let me know if you guys need anything else in the meantime again tag dm email call text whatever you need to do um and we'll get you taken care of in the meantime let me know if uh any other issues pop up in the app please so we can get that uh working as well as we can for you all and ready for new users to grow the community um but i hope you guys have a wonderful
