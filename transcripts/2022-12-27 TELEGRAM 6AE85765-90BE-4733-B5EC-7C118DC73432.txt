[Speaker 1]
I hope everybody had a very, very Merry Christmas. I snuck in here a few times I was reading, but I wasn't saying much on Christmas or the day after.

[Speaker 4]
Can you hear me all right?

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. All righty. Well, I hope everybody's recovering well and having my liver cleanse tea.

I think it's mainly like milk thistle and dandelion. Great for your liver after a holiday weekend. But I just wanted to update you on everything.

There's a lot we're waiting for obviously just with the holidays being around. I think everybody's just a little bit slower getting on everything and you know most people being out of the office. Hopefully hanging out with family and spending some quality time.

You guys did great with the over counter sales for Marketing Wallet. We actually have a few more sales from the Marketing Wallet scheduled and if that goes as planned that should empty us out. And then actually that's with somebody waiting on some more funds to come in for like a few more grand.

So thank you for that. That's amazing. We haven't needed to sell anything to bring the charts down and been able to pay bills at the same time.

I know I went through our bills since we changed management. We have Versell, Google, Cloudways, Printify, more Versell, Google, Shopify, Cloudways, Amazon, Canva, Twitter, Amazon. So that's plus we have the dev bills and I believe everything that bill is or that list is everything I went through since taking over billing I believe.

So that's amazing. That totaled out so this didn't include our app development. It did include the one payment we've made to the gift card which is the first payment we made to the gift card first $2,000 and the total I have totaled out is $3,948.90. So we're doing pretty well there and that includes a bulk of that too $1,111.76 includes the Printify orders right which is what we pay for merch basically our overhead for merch. So not bad at all obviously a lot of that comes back with more. So amazing. Thank you for that.

Don't forget merch is 20% off till the end of the year. We just did that honestly doesn't leave us some items I think with any profit after that but gives everybody a chance to score some merch and chill some FJB in real life if we ever leave the house. The smart wallet is looking amazing.

Please let me know if you have any issues. I think the only issue I was aware of is with Heath and we figured that out basically it's just transitioning your funds if you have funds in the expert wallet that need to be moved to smart wallet they're not going to be moved over if you don't have the gas in your expert wallet. I'm sorry hold on give me a second my dog's at the door.

All right sorry about that the zoo is in here my husband had to leave for a hockey game with his dad so nobody to keep him away from me. So yeah back to the smart wallet I think everything's looking pretty good but please let me know if you have any issues we would like to get some more users using it just to work out some bugs as usual. But I think it's looking pretty clean.

Thank you to our developers it's been looking amazing to Noman and Velo. Heath says did you find out about having FJB in smart wallet and expert mode? Sorry what do you mean?

Oh on the are you talking about how it would look in trust wallet? No I'm actually waiting for Velo and I don't think he gave us an answer. I know he said it wouldn't really impact trust wallet.

Yes the totals are different waiting on Velo for that. Yes but I'll let you know as soon as I hear back from him. Our website we're just still waiting on some edits but I think the website's still looking amazing.

We're going to get in the flow for the new year to start sending out more emails to our subscribers that way it just kind of keeps FJB on everybody's mind. So that's very excited for that and all the changes. Gift cards we're still waiting basically like I said we are still waiting on Larry Goledom.

We're still waiting on quite a few people understandably with the holidays like everybody else right? So we are still waiting on the gift card devs and then for the final template that I'm putting together with the of some of you. We're just waiting for the final steps to get that completed to make sure you know we have an idea of what the steps are going to be from the devs but kind of waiting on that to finalize that out so that'll be awesome.

As far as our donation we're waiting on the organization. I think everybody will be very happy about it. Super I think it really aligns with our values so awesome there but again just waiting.

They already got back to us I think I told you last time the founder said he was gonna call me that day. Still haven't received a call from him but again holiday weekend Christmas weekend so understandable there. I have been reaching out to radio stations and talk shows that target boomers not only for their rates on radio but also for their events to for basically vendor information for their in-person events.

I was told the latest by tomorrow the biggest one I believe Kristen who manages several of them is supposed to get back to me by tomorrow morning she said the latest with a list of all of those so very excited for that. I spent half the day trying to figure out YouTube because when I try to sign in there from our FJV account tells me we're suspended. There's no YouTube support even their like phone number in California absolutely ridiculous and then I just kept being like looped back from you know them saying contact Google workspace and back to YouTube but finally we got an angel who really took care of us and he says he walked us through everything there were some things we needed to accept and not sign but I guess just accept terms and web services and he said by end of day we should be able to get in there so I'll keep you updated on that hopefully we'll get either YouTube back or at least be able to start a new one.

Also today super excited we did get our own P.O. box so that'll be super cool our own mailing address we needed that for several things and this is not just like you know I mean some things need your obviously address that's associated with the twins LLC but some other sorry sorry if you hear my dog's nails just sitting here but yeah that's super exciting I'll make that address public as soon as it's finalized I just got to get it notarized to finalize that and start receiving the mail.

We also have the now payments that should be activated any minute we don't have an exact time but basically to be able to pay crypto to the Shopify store for merch. Let me go I think I only received one set of questions are there conditions for war room segment specifically if so what conditions? At this point in time no there are no like particular conditions we've been given but I will let you know if that changes that has changed a few times before but no currently definitely not to my understanding.

Many are becoming delusional with the outlook direction of FJB and that SKB is not interested anymore what can you say to allay those concerns? So I know there's been a lot of talk in that as far as oh Bannon and Boris are done with us I can assure you that's not the case I really 100% believe that unfortunately the legal side of things have taken a lot of the FJB time slot so to say they are very much here like I've kind of explained before even when I'm discussing this with Boris he just he doesn't understand the rush which don't get me wrong like don't I'm with you I understand what you're what you all are feeling and I understand what they're saying right for them this is a long-term project they are not particularly in a rush they understand the entire market including you know stock market crypto market is down 80-90% we are not the only ones granted our missing funds may have to do with us being down 90% or may not you know because who knows I mean if we had the missing funds maybe people would have sold out I mean you know you can't really say with that right but this is a long-term project for them and you've got to realize that having their name on this like that alone might not seem a big like a big deal but if they wanted to leave the project or were leaving the project there is no way in heck especially with Boris Boris's number one top priority from my understanding is always liability like understandably he's an attorney the first thing they would do is get their name off everything so yeah I mean there's really not much more to say on it it's you know if you look on Steve Bannon's getter which is his main I would say platform really outside of war room.org and fjbcoin.org is right there I don't know if you all saw that Grace there was a false war well not like an unofficial truth so war room truth truth social oh I'm so sorry my dog finally laid down there's an unofficial war room truth social page that went after one of our fjb members and threatened them with a cease and desist because they saw that we had war room in one of our logos Grace got on that right away asked them to contact her or else they'll have legal get on them because they are not an official war room account and because they made that threat to us because we obviously are a project owned by Steve Bannon and Boris Epstein so I don't know if you saw that there was something else what was there there's something else on getter oh no it was on here actually one of our members got kicked out of the band from the war room telegram and they thought it's because of an fjb link they included but it was actually a bot that kicked them out and it seems like maybe links like automatically if you enter a link that includes anything kind of like our room they have the bots kick you out um so yeah there's not I mean let me know if you have any more detailed uh questions I can answer on that but really it just all comes to that they don't want they understand um understandably that a lot of the community is not happy here they don't want to add to that they don't want to add another five ten thousand unhappy people um so that's kind of where they're at um I'm sure you all know Bannon himself uh spent almost four hundred thousand dollars of his own money um buying more fjb coins above his billion um at all-time high so he is way way way down on that and um you know if he was just looking to bring up the charge or charts I assume and get his money out I assume all he'd do is uh put it on war room um and that comes back to also Bannon um from my understanding was very not happy with the way wire went down it was I think pretty embarrassing to all of us and most of the team um so I think we definitely don't want to be repeating that again but we definitely don't want people to spend their hard-earned money um on something that's you know gonna continue uh basically the them saying oh you you uh you know them do that and a bunch of people here the whales sell out and them be down them so again I just it's a long-term project for them but they both definitely are here you um you've also seen it from members of fjb who've written Boris and I've gotten the screenshot sent to me and been asked to take care of it um again if Boris you know wanted to leave the project or was uh left the project would just say hey I'm not with the project anymore remove my name let's uh sell this project to somebody else um so they are again legally owners of the project to my knowledge as you see with the twins LLC um so again if we will keep you updated um that you'd be the first to know if you know any changes like that were happening I don't see that anytime soon um I asked that I've been asked by that um I think by the discord community so I actually asked Boris that a few weeks ago and I was told heck no um they are not selling the project there are no ideas or um anything like that of selling the project uh another question is Boris rescheduling a voice chat yes um however uh we are told right now like we haven't rescheduled anything yet um from the last one that was I think a few Tuesdays ago we were supposed to record a call with him is a launch being planned um I don't know if you mean like a war room launch if uh that's what you mean no there's honestly not a like there's we're not putting like a war room skit together I know there is still a recorded segment that with the um with the like skit uh recorded from a few months ago um or the the skit written for the recording um I have not seen the recording myself um but that's as far as I know regarding a war room launch or a date for that I'll go back to chat excuse me um any news on I'm assuming white paper and new tax structure yep we will have that out uh tax structure definitely before the end of the year uh white paper really depends on how quick we can get um volunteers editing appreciate that very very much they're doing an amazing job and I can't wait for you all to see um the tech side and the frequently asked questions uh thank you very much appreciate that Tim hi Sarah so when you say that they B&B are not in a rush what does that mean in terms of a timeline um I honestly cannot tell you um um of a timeline um because I don't have one and I don't want to lie to you um but that's the answers I'm getting I will let you know as soon as I get the timeline welcome awesome um let me know if you have any other questions um let's see our app um I know Pierre sent some API info from like Fiverr um but I'm not sure I'm not I don't know if you're listening right now I don't know if he's here doesn't look like him actually I'm not sure if anybody else can answer this but I'm not sure if was meaning that towards the app development we had spoken about I think on Friday um regarding adding like in the app we'd like something that says oh uh invite like send send the app to a friend like invite a friend to use the app to download the app um and send them coins and possibly even push notifications so I did get that um link to the Fiverr link saying like I think it's like 150 dollars or something like that because our dev said that would cost us about two one to two thousand dollars to work on something like that and to add it to the app um but let me know because I did look at that but that didn't seem we used bit query oh yeah oh I know why it's like oh yeah I didn't add that to uh the list of bills but that's because we paid that straight out of um the wallet using crypto Larry wants a puppy treat yeah I've been cutting down treats because I'm feeding him raw now and he has these like calluses on his elbow that I think are getting better I bet they're eating like raw meat usually I'll add like a raw egg and then like a sardine and kefir a whole uh bowl takes him forever to eat it now because he sits there and like sniffs and enjoys everything our social media is great I'm not sure if you all noticed we've gotten a ton actually most of our Shopify visitors come from Twitter so that's amazing great job on that and everybody sharing those posts we will announce the 12 days of Christmas winners by Friday he says that bellow chat discussing the smart wallet got a lot of oh awesome I actually haven't checked that I need to go check it tried to get like some time off here for Christmas and we have like we have a birthday on Christmas too so but I want to check it now I'm hoping we get that blue check mark and hoping that helps us

[Speaker 2]
let's see oh my gosh you guys see what's happening with Carrie Lake

[Speaker 1]
yeah bellows um voice chat with us was amazing sorry I screwed up the uh recording I did find out why somebody else is coming on I need to change my recorder recording settings since I use QuickTime to record oh that's awesome got 20 retweets from that view counts are not available for this tweet why because they're too high probably nice good job bellow I'm trying to go to his profile to see if it shows on there oh it does show on his over a thousand that's awesome 1098 nice job going back to the puppy trees though I do need to get um elk antlers but I don't want to buy them on like Amazon or Costco I was going to grab some when we went up north a week or so ago but ended up snowing so we couldn't I think the team should capitalize on the smart wallet in a non-custodial wallet yes absolutely it's huge I think that's why um getting people like fellow said really the best way to get more people testing it um without repeating a wire um situation it not obviously I understand that wasn't um you know why we went down um with wire had nothing to do with the app malfunctioning or anything like that or crashing um but like velo said that's why it's kind of important to slowly start gaining users so we can work out the bugs and see how much the app can handle um before we do something like war room and you know have thousands of people getting on at one time and I know I know my grandma if she would do something like that it didn't work it's like ah okay that's what I think I think in a way and this is complete assumption completely me assuming um nothing Vannon or Boris have said uh nothing their assistant has said nothing Grace has said um but I do think a little bit of it may be like waiting for us to get our ish together um and again that's pure assumption from me but I do feel that a little bit especially with uh the way wire went down and kind of you know a few more unfortunate things we've gone through that might be me like also talking because I always like any situation I'm always like oh what could I have done better so that that may just be me but again totally assuming that but I do feel that way a little bit peace on Ukraine yeah Mixon's back

[Speaker 5]
safe marketing funds

[Speaker 2]
yeah let me know if there's any um coins you guys think would work out on our app

[Speaker 5]
there's so many designs in the merch store I don't know if you guys saw those

[Speaker 1]
um thank you Tim I'm sure I mean you've seen how uh fired up Boris gets so I have no doubt um he'll get right back there with FJB and uh sharing FJB with everybody

[Speaker 5]
um

[Speaker 1]
I think we got those out Tim I don't think we have any more of those would the team consider disabling the smart wallet aspect for a simple buy direct from Fiat for the

[Speaker 5]
app I'm not sure what that means sorry

[Speaker 1]
to clear up wallet issues um I don't know that anybody is having any wallet issues I haven't I haven't heard of it if so definitely reach out to me if there's any other issues did you cover legal um no Boris is taking care of legal we still have the dev um bill with Velo um right over 8k and we're like sort of well on a payment plan for that just because we need uh our funds to pay our other bills too and we have like ongoing bills or yeah like at this point a few hundred dollars a month but um of course that also like we're adding to that like now we have an Amazon bill and now we have a Printify bill and now we're I'm sorry Shopify bill um so I think that's also changing as we add um now we'll have like a P.O. box bill you know with the more the more we add obviously the more bills we'll have once we um start in-person events we'll definitely have some costs for that too um some other costs we have coming up is getting in-person shirts printed um and we'll start small and probably like hats and stickers but we're talking probably like at least a thousand dollars a thousand bucks um so kind of stuff like that like any startup

[Speaker 3]
but yeah thankfully the legal was taken care of which is awesome um wish it were under better circumstances but you know we'll take it how can bills be paid if nobody needs a transaction volume up

[Speaker 1]
this will need immediate push at some point yes absolutely good thing we have Bannon and Boris definitely hoping um once the holidays are up I know they're super super busy that we get back to that and at least get some sort of timeline for that that is definitely being worked on

[Speaker 5]
if there's any other questions questions

[Speaker 4]
oh my gosh I don't remember the last time I had McDonald's I used to love their chicken nuggets and fries

[Speaker 1]
my dog loved their ice cream and you know how like half the time more than half the time their ice cream machine's broken and he would be so disappointed in did you find out about if team takes a slice from smart wallet transactions um I spoke to our newer Deb on that and he said no but to check with fellow of Velo and I am waiting on Velo for an answer on that let me know as soon as I hear where were you with all these questions when Velo was on here just kidding no holders are lucky I know I completely agree um Tim says we cannot have the attitude of not bringing new holders because they might get upset um yes I totally agree with you um we are actively working on that um it's just kind of extra hard with holidays happening you know give them a little bit of space until we go back at it but um again it is being worked on and I think it'll be perfect timing we'll done a few days as soon as the new year's over I uh promise you I understand how urgent and big this is and I would also like to have at least a timeline or you know a rough estimate or like somebody else asked some if there's like some prerequisites to us getting on war room just for us to all be on the same page um but again I don't want to just lie to you and I understand we've dealt with that for some time um so I'm just telling you the truth um but it is being worked on what do we need to do as holders um I think you guys are doing a ton we have a ton of volunteers um helping out we have everybody holding up the charts we've had um like I said we have two more transactions that should clear out our marketing wallet for over counter sales so we have us tv instead without selling anything and bringing the charts down um Richard Nixon says vote um but we appreciate everything you guys are doing I see you guys replying to anybody who comes in asking for help so yeah I think everybody's uh it's been great getting so much help and uh moving forward much quicker than we have before and getting so much more done and I think um just looking at the website looking at the app I think that's very clear to see although yes I understand that the chart is the biggest indicator and agree with that but ew I'm so sad I think I have to get a new phone and I hate getting a new phone it's like the worst thing ever for me ew at this point I think I'm gonna get on getter and uh start a platform to get people going

[Speaker 2]
I do actually have a local friend I don't know how many followers he has though let me see

[Speaker 4]
I don't think he's ever been on war room though let's see rumble I know he got uh kicked off

[Speaker 1]
youtube a while ago let's see rumble I guess I don't really know rumble well enough how how like great is a million views on rumble is that a big deal

[Speaker 3]
Winston says no bots on rumble

[Speaker 1]
I wonder if this as I'm looking actually it's like this one video that has a million views so I wonder if it was shared by somebody big because the second uh video under that is like

[Speaker 2]
57 000 views that's a big win wide wide range there I do think he interviewed uh Boris

[Speaker 5]
a few months ago let's see if I can find that one

[Speaker 3]
that one only has like 300 views

[Speaker 1]
do bnb know about the smart wallet progress yes absolutely

[Speaker 4]
invite you on facebook what do you mean you need a link to the fjb facebook oh what did you get banned on facebook for

[Speaker 2]
you although I've gotten when the covet stuff was happening I've gotten a few warnings

[Speaker 3]
we got banned on facebook from trolling the world cup that's pretty impressive don't we didn't do so well but

[Speaker 1]
oh Lauren I'm gonna color my hair tonight but I'm not getting it cut just color I'm not emotionally ready for that yet I do need a trim

[Speaker 4]
like I'm gulping my tea yeah I wouldn't be chopping it at all but I think it needs like

[Speaker 3]
needs something so it doesn't look like the cat lady definitely needs a trim

[Speaker 1]
okay yeah I feel like cat lady because my hair has like gotten so long

[Speaker 3]
wall street that's yeah I think well we've been on that I need to check but we're still following it again

[Speaker 1]
do you have cat lady hair though

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if I have cat lady hair jose says do you still have faith in them banning wars oh yeah hasn't even started think about with wire and where we were just a few hours in well

[Speaker 1]
is that gonna get the fjb charts up I should start a getter though that's gonna that's a gonna move that's gonna move fjb out

[Speaker 3]
or rumble or all

[Speaker 1]
soon winston soon

[Speaker 4]
yeah right amazing and go to marketing

[Speaker 1]
does bnb want legal issue done before war room um not to my knowledge because that's going to take a long time I imagine um and again bnb aren't new to lawsuits like lawsuits are going to go on while life goes on you know it's a part of business and what are you going to do you're not just going to stop your business because you have a lawsuit

[Speaker 3]
after war room launch we can do get our lives with guest fjb promoters yes absolutely

[Speaker 1]
I've tried dm'ing a few people um maybe I start dm'ing them from our official fjb to get them to show our merchandise or get a percentage of it we do have a facebook group richard mixon

[Speaker 3]
um we got a new one because uh the person with our last one refused to give it up

[Speaker 2]
let me see if I have a link somebody else probably has it quicker than me but we should do facebook from my phone

[Speaker 1]
are we caught up on the 20k we were short um no boris took care of or is taking care of the legal bill uh so that took a nice chunk I don't remember off the top of my head but I want to say that was is that around 10k I don't remember off the top of my head now so don't quote me on that um but he took care of that and uh we paid down the velo bill down to right over 8k I believe right in that range yeah it's the only thing the nice thing about facebook is it does have a lot of older people and surprisingly a lot of them I have no idea what getter is

[Speaker 2]
I've never seen that group I need to add that will they let you though a lot of um groups up like that usually don't allow promotion actually I just thought I found a group online that would be

[Speaker 1]
once we get our in-person uh merch I definitely want to post those in like the marketplace uh if they let us they usually will if it's not fge related I've seen like a mega stuff

[Speaker 2]
posted with promotion let's see if we're at a wow there's actually a lot of let's go groups

[Speaker 3]
oh nice nice job Lauren I just saw that I was on my phone because I was adding it so I don't get on facebook usually for my phone nice

[Speaker 2]
nice watch everybody go in there and join my group

[Speaker 1]
is anybody doing fireworks for new year's I've had um my like spotify play fireworks noises to get the new puppies used to it so they don't freak out crazy trucker that is why most of my family is on there though I got a lot of family members around there see if there's any more questions before I hop off getting my hair colored then I gotta go to the grocery store and I'm gonna make some spinach I just choked up today because I have a bunch of

[Speaker 2]
baby spinach to get rid of before it goes bad that's the only way I can get my husband to eat it
