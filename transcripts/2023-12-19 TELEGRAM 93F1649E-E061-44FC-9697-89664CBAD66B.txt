[Speaker 2]
Okay, recording.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, happy Tuesday, just wanted to get on here. I know there's been a lot of questions and I've not had time to get to my DMs. I got to a few urgent ones, or what seemed to be, but I know I've seen a lot of questions in the general chats. I know I haven't been super active on there just because I've been busy.

I've been at the event, which I'm exhausted from, by the way. It's nice to get home and get into comfy clothes again. So I'll see if I have any questions.

[Speaker 2]
I think I got some DMs. I'll do, I'll go through those first.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I see somebody asking, can you confirm that you said polygon aromatic in the voice chat because I listened and missed it. People are stating that as fact here. So yes, that is, that is true.

We are forking to the Polygon Network. And then I have another question. Sorry, just reading through everything.

What happens to the wallets of XT and LBanks since they delisted us? Do they own those FJB or were they just used for the exchanges? If this is, okay.

Okay, I think that was all the question. So, okay, so regarding anybody who hasn't, I will DM you each separately. But if you still have your coins on XT or LBank, you can still transfer them off and sell them because the contract, the FJB version 3 contract is alive and will be alive for likely ever.

So you can do that. And then once Patriot Pay is live, you can go ahead and purchase Patriot Pay. The thing is, we cannot airdrop you coins for that XT and LBank because we are not going to be on LBank or XT.

This is why I told you guys for weeks and weeks and I'm pretty sure months now, several months, to get your tokens on there. Again, I get it. Some of you are busy.

Some of you aren't here all the time. And if that's you, you're probably not listening right now anyway. But if you have friends or anything like that, again, I will message you all individually.

Most of you are asking about friends' coins and wallets. So I will message you individually. My goal is to get DMs done by the end of the night here.

But that's what you can do. You can get them off XT and LBank into Trust Wallet to go ahead and sell them. You might still be, I think you could still sell them on XT or LBank too.

You should be able to. Maybe not XT, but for sure LBank. So that's that.

I think that's all the questions I got in my inbox. Colorado is insane.

[Speaker 2]
Trump is on.

[Speaker 4]
Iowa.

[Speaker 2]
Nice. Okay. Oh, shoot.

Somebody just got kicked.

[Speaker 1]
I'm most excited for a new channel so that hopefully a rose doesn't glitch. She always claims people say trade when they don't, and we don't even have that word blocked.

[Speaker 2]
Can you give us a rundown of what's to come this week?

[Speaker 1]
So right now we are waiting on integrating that change now. Once that's complete, I did tell you guys I'll give you a 24-hour notice before. I know some of you have gotten plenty of DMs asking what you need to do to get ready, what you need to have in your wallet to purchase more Patriot Pay.

So you'll have all those questions answered and I'll post them with instructions for 24 hours before we go live. So that hasn't changed. However, the rundown.

So once the change now integration is complete, um, then we're, we still have to test the contract and the app, which we estimate one to two days. Um, everything should work amazing. We have amazing devs that have been working on this section, um, the last few weeks.

Um, so once that's complete, we will likely still have you test, uh, just to make sure before we have any larger volume, um, we'd like to do that. So we'll probably have you guys test, uh, still before going live. And then after that, we are ready to go live and then you can purchase as much as you want with no limits or anything like that.

Uh, and then after that we can kick off marketing. Uh, in the meantime, we are working on a few things for launch day. So, but that's kind of the order that that's going to go in.

There. I don't have a day yet. Kindling says, so we'll go live perhaps on Monday and holy smokes.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my gosh. Monday is Christmas.

[Speaker 1]
Oh my gosh. I've not bought one gift. Wow.

I've been very immersed in a Patriot Pay world. Holy smokes. I didn't realize, I didn't realize, uh, Christmas was six days away.

Yikes. Maybe I'll just do Patriot Pay gift cards for gifts. Actually, my dad would probably like that.

My mom probably not. Spotify keeps changing my settings and I don't like it because it brings these songs that I hate. I don't know what's going on.

Uh, let's see. I don't think I have any other questions. I think all my other DMs are things I just need to help people with.

[Speaker 2]
Anything else?

[Speaker 1]
Our social media, uh, by the way, We The People has been doing amazing. Um, his one post is, has over 90,000. Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
Six mentions.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. 92, almost 93,000 with almost 32,000 engagements. That is huge.

Oh, airdrop before change now integration. Um, those will happen very, very close to each other. Very close.

Hey, Sarah, will the crypto advisor be controlling the smart contract? I don't know what you mean by controlling the smart contract. Um, BNB affected our coin, I believe a hundred percent.

[Speaker 2]
So if BNB went up 10% FGB also went up on the polygon network.

[Speaker 1]
If polygon goes up a hundred percent, how does that affect Patriot? Uh, I'm not sure about that. That's a question for our advisor.

So yeah, I apologize, but I can't get you the right answer to that. Okay. So, uh, I don't know what you mean by controlling the smart contract.

I don't know what I can, uh, I can DM you tonight or just share it in chat tonight. We're paired with, um, Polygon while Matic the same way we were paired with BNB. So, but I am not sure.

So I won't answer that for you. Oh, do, um, please be careful. I know you guys saw my announcement this morning.

So we've already confirmed, um, that we've had holders get scammed out of their coins. So, uh, please just wait for the official announcement and instructions because then, you know, I know you might have it figured out, but give somebody else instructions. And what's so nice about our community is we have a lot of first time crypto, uh, holders.

So we just don't want people to take the wrong steps and lose their funds. So that has been confirmed that we've had somebody get scammed this morning. So yeah, please stay away from that.

And don't also just stay away from giving instructions. You know, you don't want to be responsible for somebody. I know you're not and everybody's responsible for their own wallets, but, um, just, I would, I would stay away from giving anybody instructions and just wait for the official instructions to come out.

Scammed out of what coins? Like other coins in their wallet? No, out of their actually, out of their FJB coins, I guess.

Um, they went to download an app and they went to the app store, the Apple app store and searched QuickSwap and downloaded that app and entered their seed phrase and got okayed some push notifications. And then their coins were gone. Somebody transferred the coins out of their wallet, it looks like.

So it wouldn't matter now after a snapshot. Well, we'd still, for security, would need to airdrop back to that same wallet. So I guess that depends.

I'm not sure how I've, knock on wood, never experienced that. So I'm not sure if anybody has experienced getting scammed, if they empty it out and then just leave it, or do they keep that wallet open too for you to use or, you know, empty it out anytime you put something in there. I'm not sure how, I'm not sure how scammers do it to be honest, but maybe somebody in here knows or has experienced it.

You mentioned many moons ago that we couldn't be at Trump rallies with the FJB ticker, but after we fork, we have the green light. Now that we're PatriotPay, when will we be at Trump rallies? Yeah, 100%.

Yes. Yeah, I'll have more of the marketing questions covered for you soon. Very, very exciting and kind of really worked out perfectly the timing with this weekend with the TPUSA event here locally.

Worked out very, very well. It sounds as if we don't go live before Monday. We're definitely trying to.

So we'll keep you all updated. It is still early. We're still on Tuesday, but of course.

And again, if nothing else, it'll at least be testing, which is fine. That way if you guys are available, you can help us test. Make sure the devs are around to fix any bugs.

And that's, it's tough. It's always tough with that because, you know, it works for the dev, it works for me, it works for our advisor, and then bring on 30 of you and, you know, a few of you it's not working for, whether it's certain devices or what have you. Will we get the airdrop before going live?

Yes. Anything happening? Yeah, so much happening.

So much on such a good weekend. Very excited. So it's been a very, very full weekend slash week.

Is it necessary to have FJB in the same wallet when Snapshot occurred at time of airdrop? Yes, for the most part. Will Bannon feature Patriot Pay on War Room?

Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Could it be we get the contract address before going live?

Yes, absolutely. I'll make sure to give you all the information and instructions at least 24 hours before we go live. I know because I've received a lot of DMs on people asking what they need in their wallets to purchase, what they need to have ready, how to do it.

I'll make sure to type out very, very, very detailed. I'll see depending on what it turns out to be on which steps could be divided up into like screen recorded videos with instructions for you. But I will make sure to have that ready for you guys 24 hours before we go live.

I think most of you here come in once every 24 hours, so you can have that ready. And that's why I'm saying don't try, please don't try to figure it out on your own if you know, especially if you are relatively newer to crypto in general, just because I do not want you to get hacked. If you get scammed by clicking on a link or typing a link or downloading a bad app, then you're kind of screwed.

The sooner the better for the contract address to correct, but the contract address needs to be finalized, which it is not. Which is why I'm asking you guys to please not just don't mess with anything. Just sit tight.

Sit tight, and I'll get you all the information you need. You'll have plenty of time. Maybe I should start like tagging everybody every few hours for the last 24 hours, like every 60 minutes.

It might get annoying, but then hopefully everybody checks.

[Speaker 3]
What is that? That's a cute baby.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, very, very excited. Just trying to line the ducks up. Oh, yeah, I get it.

And I appreciate how excited you guys are. It makes all the work worth it. Boris keeps asking when.

He asked, I think, twice yesterday, and then only once so far today. I think he's excited. Steve's pumped.

Will there be a tax on transferring to different wallets? Yeah, nothing is changing as far as tax, the way tax works. Tax structure is changing, but we are discussing the whole transfer.

Seem to be a few of you who are pretty concerned about that. It's just, you know, bad actors kind of ruin it for everybody, but I will do what I can. I'm trying to see what I can do, even if it's just for a very short amount of time.

I don't know why you guys all want to consolidate everything into one wallet, though, because that to me, I don't know, maybe I just don't mind a bunch of seed phrases. I just feel like it's more like, I don't know, like, yeah, I don't click on links or download weird stuff, but who knows, maybe, I don't know, maybe one day one of my wallets will somehow get spammed. I don't want to lose everything.

You mentioned we can buy unlimited after we go live. Does that mean there's a limit on how much we can go buy in that 24-hour indoor area? No, so basically it has to do with testing.

So we want you guys to test. That's why we did the limit. Well, again, once that's all finalized, you'll have very detailed instructions, but more so just so we all can stress test without actually having, you know, without actually having a ton of price movement or if anything goes wrong, you know, it'll just be the best, so far the best option for us.

So it'll be a very, very, very small, very small limit that would not impact impact your wallet or the charts much, but it will get the job done of the testing and seeing if our devs need to make any tweaks there. Will BabyFGB be changing to BabyPPY? No.

No, sir. No, no more babies. We've had, uh, you know, we're done.

We're done having babies. Too old. And our, that's it.

I don't know what people call that when they're done. Is there a word? I'm sure there's a word.

When you're done having babies? I don't know. Not an empty nester.

Menopause. Well, I was talking by choice though, but I guess menopause. I was thinking I'm sure there's a word like, I don't know, by choice to stop.

Still can't believe it's been two years. Yeah, we're going on. Now it's going to be two years since BNB came on.

It's wild. I remember making those announcements and I was across the world and my wifi, like, I don't know. It's weird over there obviously.

And I was freaking out because my posts weren't going through and it was time. Oh my gosh. Sure.

That works. I feel like I already have a, I have a ton of kids between here and the foster kids at church. I think I'll have like one, two, maybe three.

I don't know. Need to hurry up and get started on that. I did get stuck.

Yeah, I got stranded there. It's pretty bad. Anything new on missing funds?

No, Derek. There's not anything new on missing funds right now because our top priority is getting this done. Once I have time to breathe, we will move on to that.

The attorneys are ready. When will it be okay to send Matic into my Patriot Pay app to have it ready for the swap? Once the app is ready, which app-wise is ready, but it again needs to be changed now.

It needs to be integrated in there. I have a hard time imagining Sam as a dad. That's funny.

Will I have to download it, the updated and ready app? No. So far, no.

The updates are going through. Actually, I do need to check onto something though.

[Speaker 3]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
I do need to check on something from the app store because it's been two business days. Today marks three for the customer service. Any word from Apple or Google?

No.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, actually, she just got back to me 15 minutes ago.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. No, we're just waiting on them.

[Speaker 3]
But I did ask them both a few days ago for an update. Apple just got back to me. Let's check.

[Speaker 1]
Google makes you sign a whole agreement just for Australia. It's a little weird. All for Ed.

No, I know there's a few of you guys in Australia.

[Speaker 3]
Maybe several, I should say.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, boy. Change now doesn't work weekends, or their devs don't. Will there be a similar digital airstrike in the future?

[Speaker 3]
Why can't you guys move on?

[Speaker 1]
No, we're not using that. Can we come up with a new name? Happy to come up with something else.

And we're not doing it on August 2nd. And we're not, what was all the other stuff? Tuesday.

Well, I guess that one kind of made sense because we're hoping that change now is done by today. Does Finn know what you're doing? Oh, yeah.

I speak to Finn pretty regularly. He's a super nice guy. Actually, really, really nice.

I love Finn. I think it would be good if we had a true follow through. Yeah, I think we have had some true big follow throughs, especially in the past week.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if you guys found some of the stuff you weren't supposed to find.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like you guys find everything within minutes. What? How?

How? Why? What are you doing?

It's so funny. It won't be denied. Yeah, I guess so.

Decentralized world. I feel like no matter what it is, it just somehow somebody finds it, you all have like assigned jobs or something. Either that or you guys have like bots alerting you.

I don't know. We're just ready to see Patriot Pay be the next better Bitcoin. Hey, I'm ready too.

I'm ready. Pretty sure Boris is ready. And Steve is definitely ready.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's pretty.

[Speaker 1]
I need to get a new desk. I love my chair. Lately, I feel like it's like starting to creak.

Oh, I saw the bubble on my phone. It popped up and I was like, wait, how's anybody buying right now? Just to clarify the order, airdrop, 24 hour notice, video launch going live.

When I give you the 24 hour notice with instructions, I don't know, video might be with that too. So yeah, I'm not, I'm not sure. Those are all going to happen so close together minus a 24 hour notice.

And you guys beginning probably testing that. Yeah, they'll all be very, very close that you may actually not notice. But I'll keep you updated.

[Speaker 3]
For apologies.

[Speaker 2]
What do you mean? What do you mean, sir?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, apologies for me. I forgive. I forgive.

What's funny is though. I don't know if it's funny. What's interesting though, is those people just seem to disappear.

And then, you know, and then different handles show up. That's, that's generally what happens. But I have I've gotten a few apologies, I will say.

I have gotten a few apologies, which is very nice. I think it takes a lot to admit you are wrong and apologize. I appreciate that.

Public. I don't think I don't think I've received any public apology. I could be wrong though, because the last few days I'm being busy at the conference.

I haven't gone through, you know, everything. That's funny. FJB, take America back.

See, looks like update is still in review.

[Speaker 2]
So let's see. Let's see who I can bug. Who can I ask?

Win, win, win, win, win. Give me a second. I haven't seen that one for a while.

[Speaker 1]
No apologies needed from me. Any OGs know I've been a peacekeeper with reasonable demands. Oh, you're welcome.

Have a good night. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

I have not bought one thing for yet. So awful.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Anything else before I get off? Still have some DMs to get through.

[Speaker 1]
Still having a surprise voice chat on airdrop day aside from Friday voice chat was combined. Yeah, no, definitely. If we hopefully, if we're ready to go before Friday, we'll definitely have a voice chat.

Absolutely. For sure.

[Speaker 2]
That's pretty cool. I like those colors.

[Speaker 1]
But you guys know I like birds. I like birdies. Although my one bird, did I tell you guys, my one bird right now says, oh shit, a lot.

Like all the time. Good night. Good news, truth.

See you later. Will there be a support team with the app? Yes, we'll have that linked into the app and into the website.

I have a few meetings this week to make a decision on that. Because we'll definitely need that. When we got on War Room last time in the first, was it like an hour and a half, two hours?

There was plenty of support tickets. I could barely keep up with them actually at the time.

[Speaker 2]
But we'll definitely have those ready.

[Speaker 3]
Maybe have you guys test it too. Glory.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no kidding. It's like a, it's like an AI bot. Everything he says in the support.

We need him to train the AI. I don't see the typings. I think that's everything.

Please remember, do not click on links. Don't download any weird apps. And don't put your seed phrase.

So generally, the apps I know of that link, if you connect to a wallet, it usually won't ask for your seed phrase. So that's something to be wary of. But definitely for support too, I'll never DM you first and no other admins will DM you first.

To be honest, I think the easiest thing to do is just confirm in the general chat, you know, confirm you guys know all the regulars. So just tag a few of your friends, don't DM them in the general chat, and I'm sure somebody will answer you. Usually, there's several of us on, like I'm always on, I have the pop-ups turned off.

I just am usually working on something else. So then I'll see if it's something urgent, then I'll open to answer right away. Otherwise, but I usually see unless I'm on a phone call or something, then I'm not looking.

But please do that because we do not want you to lose out on any funds. But if you need anything else, in the meantime, feel free to tag, DM me, email, text, email, or call, whatever you need to do. And then we'll go from there.

You are very welcome. Merry Christmas, and I'll have some updates very, very soon. Very excited.
