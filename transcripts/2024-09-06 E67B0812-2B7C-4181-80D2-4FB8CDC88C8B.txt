We've had a great week in the Patriot Pay world, let's just get right to it. So our direct on off-ramp is complete. We are just integrating it into the app, working out some details.

(0:21 - 1:28)
If you all want to check it out. We are just working out some details regarding the fees for you all, so that's nice, we definitely hit our deadline, which was by the end of the month, nice and early like I said it's just the app integration along with the fees, just trying to get it really perfect, but the on off-ramp is live so that's awesome there. They again are a great company who's done great things for us definitely happy to be working with them and then to continue growing as they grow.

(1:29 - 14:18)
They should be available in most areas where most of you are, if they're not available reach out and let me know they are working on being available everywhere so yeah reach out let me know if you're in one of the very few places that they're not live yet in so we'll see how that goes let me know if you're running into any issues advertisements. We should be good for tomorrow's rally very excited about that they have our graphics they have our script I will let you guys know as soon as that's live but very excited about that yeah that's all the details I have on that I also did just receive the invoice for the events at the end of the second half of September so I'll be paying those here shortly I just woke up from a night nap since my schedule has been so off I have new respect for any of you that might have like a special needs kid or animal or anything like that because having the large dog with a broken arm has been a lot harder than I thought it would be but like I said I did just receive the invoice so we'll be paying that tonight to lock in both of those dates at the end of September completely that's the final step there see as far as our app if you had if you're one of the few people that had Maddox stuck because you sent it to the wrong address we all still working on that we're also working on again the the details of PPY fees with change now I'll keep you updated on that as soon as I get updates if that is before Tuesday yeah our education videos should be very very close at least to get the first set of those if you all remember we initially had started with basics about crypto but we're taking it a step back just because they're from the some of the feedback we've received from obviously not from you all in the community but from other members and from social media advertisements actually even some emails just a little bit really goes back to being one of the very first in the crypto world for conservatives anyway it's some good and bad there right the good is that we're one of the first ones the bad is a lot of conservatives think that crypto is a scam and that it can be shut off and you know contrary I think digital scares the word digital in general scares off a lot of conservatives so we're going back to even more basic as those educational videos they will be posted not only in the app but on social media and that I think will help us with social media to as far as really providing value like we've you know said throughout now at the years really is providing value in our app as far as education goes and setting the standard there so very excited about that I think some of the questions I received when we go back we're all regarding the timing of the good was all regarding the timing of our marketing and like if we end up getting the slots that were planned which we did I also have a meeting with another company who should help us with some more marketing on I believe Thursday okay so for the Candace Owens event like I said that's been confirmed I just have to pay that invoice tonight looks like I just received that a little bit ago here what should we expect is this a commercial a banner will Candace Owens read the statement provided by the team no this will be a video video played at these events so that should be pretty cool and I think more geared towards a little bit of our target audience not exactly the boomers but the younger crowd who most of those we don't really need to talk into crypto even conservative wise most of the younger crowd I think is going to be a little bit more versed in crypto as far as you know not thinking that digital currency means that it's gonna be shut off or that it's gonna be shut off easier than your bank account which are some misconceptions that we're getting from the more mature crowd yes awesome yeah so we'll just have some more testing going on tonight and then from from this point forward we're definitely going to concentrate on making the really bread and butter of the app make sure that's functioning as best as it can smoothly as it can and handling any volume that we get that's actually what the marketing company I'm speaking to meeting with on Thursday spoke to her today we're meeting on Thursday their focus is more on that and on making sure that we can handle volume and making sure they they handled that aspect of marketing it's just how to roll it all out without because right now we're kind of in this mid where we're just want to make sure that we don't go through the whole wire like fire again but also get enough marketing on board to really start growing and push this out in the coming months feels good to finally have the basic features of our app completed and getting integration with the direct on ramp will be the final seal there because that'll cut down on the steps and just number of clicks that a new user has to do to get PPI everything I got for now definitely let you know of any major updates I have before Tuesday again you know we're always when we're depending on a third party anything can happen and seems like Murphy's Law is always there but for tomorrow we are locked in we've signed the contract we've paid everything and we're on schedule so I will update you guys if anything does happen the way it wasn't planned I'll definitely let you know there too but we're done with everything on our end and we're locked in so pretty excited to see how that goes and what kind of feedback we have there if you do run into any issues in the app please reach out and let me know again you guys know to you know DM tag just use the chat function in the app any of those will work but I think that's all I got I hope you guys have a wonderful night a safe weekend you'll probably be seeing a few more off ramps while yeah while we get a few more things paid and really excited for really excited for this I feel like it's like finally you know you finally got everything you're like done with school you're you just you know the final push so I'm excited for the future and again we'll continue improving and rolling with it I will update you on the good the bad or anything we run into before in the meantime if it is between the voice chats but again super super excited you know if you guys run into anything or if you have any issues as always please please please be careful of sharing any of your private info remember me the other admins our devs will never DM you first never call you nothing crazy like that never chat with you definitely don't share you know the code that the app sends you to log in never your seed phrase or anything like that just be careful we definitely want to reiterate that and again if you are going to connect your wallet to other extensions or apps I definitely would not connect my main wallet I would definitely make a new wallet that doesn't have much funds at all to link up to any new you know chats tokens anything like that if I ever in doubt go ahead and ask in the chat we haven't had anybody get scanned for several weeks now so we like it this way but definitely don't be afraid to ask before you do that better be safe and sorry so yeah I will update you guys again super excited about this we'll see how tomorrow goes slow and steady wins the race so we'll keep you guys updated I'll see you in general chat give me a few minutes to go ahead and post this with some notes
