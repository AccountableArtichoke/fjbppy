[Speaker 1]
I should put a link up in case you guys want to add to it, like you did last time a few weeks ago. All right, happy Friday, wow, what a week, what a day, what a morning, I went to bed super late last night, got up, my first time getting up was like at 5am and my emails and DMs were full, usually I check to see if there's anything super urgent or apply to it and then kind of, depending on the day, go back to sleep, but this morning I think it took me a few hours to finish all that up, so, nice job, ooh, thank you Stacey, she got the contest winner because I forgot about that. Give me until the end of the weekend for the contest winners to send you your code for the merch store, we just want to make sure that all the merch is updated so you don't accidentally order something that doesn't look right, just from everything we've ordered as far as sizing and everything like that goes. So congrats, I think it's Bulldog, I feel like Bulldog's won before, or maybe he was close last time, and I assume, I don't see a winner for Discord yet, oh, and that was for Discord, I see, I'm sorry, so Bulldog and then Traytan, that's a new name to me I think.

But yeah, nice job, I think Maddox, Maddox looking really good, and so is Ppy, we're still on track to get White Paper released by the end of the week, I think you all will love it. Tokonomics obviously will not be on there, just because we still have not finished airdropping, once we airdrop and burn on the Tokonomics page, of course, we'll be added to that. As soon as we do that, we'll also add it to the website, along with the roadmap.

Our dev is still working on the integration, he's still on track to be done by Tuesday, however, there is some processing that the vendor needs to do on their end, and that may take longer than Tuesday, but that's not a huge issue at all, super, super excited for that, I really, I don't know, it's kind of surreal in a way, even though we've been working on it all in the background, it's finally, I think for so long stuff was, hold on, sorry, okay, I think we got muted, it's hard when I end up hearing somebody and then I can't speak.

So for a while, I think what happened here on the back end anyways, even though we were doing everything within our power to make sure it's correct, we were still cleaning up a mess, if you will, from the past, still having a lot of that pop up that would just get us off track, and I think we're nearing the end of that, which is really good, so that we're not just having a stuff that we can't control, I think we are getting to a point that everything that we are doing, the current team is doing on the back end, and we are, you know, even though we take a lot longer, we're making sure everything is done correctly and as it should and not cutting corners, I think we're finally starting to see the outcome of our work, so it feels really good, feels really good and really rewarding, and I'm glad that you all are finally able to see all that, and for the most part that we can share most everything with you, minus a few, you know, like what the devs are working on now, a few things like that we are not sharing, and again, it's always in the best interest of the community at the end of the day, we'll continue making that the number one priority, your best interest of community, our organization, and of course our security falls under that. Let me see if I have any DMs, and I actually haven't checked emails in a few because I've been working on something here.

Okay, I have some questions from DMs, uh, what's the status of the app? Will the community be testing the app in February? Uh, we are still on track, yes, to be testing by end of February, but you guys know how that goes.

If it changes, I'll definitely let you know. Um, app store, what are we waiting for? Uh, that's still app related, that hasn't, excuse me, that hasn't changed.

Um, does the app need to be finished before the app store update the logo? Uh, no, there's some things that do, but no, we're not talking, you know, we'll continue working on the app throughout the year. We just won't start marketing until the app name is changed, for obvious reason, we don't want anything FJB related.

Uh, setting expectations, he's asking about marketing in March, uh, that all depends on the app. Asking about War Room in March, uh, very likely not. We need to do a lot of app, um, like I've mentioned before, we'll have a few different marketing campaigns, um, before we have War Room to make sure that the app is 100% ready for that, uh, because we can't, uh, we can't risk that.

We need to be able, the app needs to be able to handle, um, War Room, and that counts for bugs, but also volume. So yeah, uh, for War Room in March is, even April, is probably very unlikely, although we are interviewing for devs, um, I believe we've got a really, really awesome one, um, but I'm not going to speak too soon on that, knock on wood, um, so that's, you know, depends, but, uh, yeah, we, we definitely, even if, even if we have app 100% working, like if it was 100% working today, we'd still need a few marketing campaigns before War Room to test it, make sure everything's working as intended, there will be bugs, we know that, that's just the nature of the beast, um, and, uh, then volume, once everything is working and all the bugs are working out, we need to make sure we can handle that volume and have everything in place so that we can handle a thousand wallet creations an hour. Uh, trust wallet price, do you know if this is close to being live?

Uh, so CoinMarketCap is probably one of the slowest, uh, sorry, hold on, let me, let me go through one of the slowest platforms we've dealt with, uh, who's that? This should be free. I keep hearing so many people, oh, hold on, Vman, I'm gonna mute you, I haven't seen you for a while, uh, so yeah, that depends on CoinMarketCap, uh, and they are very, very slow, but you can always check, you know, you can always check your price on Dex or what have you, I can post links for that to make that all easier.

Uh, White Paper and Roadmap this week, uh, Roadmap's already been released, White Paper, yes, still on track. Um, yeah, that's all the updates I have as far as that goes. Let me check email really quick before I get to the chats just to make sure we got that out of the way.

I feel like several, probably not, I was gonna say several of you, but it's probably not you. Many emails in the past few days, support emails, which is a good thing. Okay, I think that's everything.

Let me go back. Uh, Sarah, is there someone that is responsible for getting all of the PPY accounts straightened out so the FJB logo isn't showing anywhere along with the removing all mention of FJB? Uh, Coinbase Wallet randomly started showing the FJB logo for PPY in multiple charts, mention FJB still.

Uh, yes, that is being worked on. James, what is wrong with you? Um, yes.

Um, I need a hat with the PPY logo, don't forget. I will not. I love hats.

Uh, actually, I think I have one in here that I ordered. Yeah, off the site. It's actually, I like it.

I like, I like the fit. I just wish they had more than, I love the fit, actually. It's, this is my favorite type of hat.

Um, they're like generic, but they're amazing. But, uh, I wish they had more options than just the patch, you know? Working on immigration.

What? Who? What are we talking about?

I must have missed something. When PPY make these sellers sorry. I'm sure, I'm sure it has.

Have you seen the charts? Come on. I'm sure some of the features in white paper probably, you guys might like those.

Um, so the app is gonna have a swap shop section. What? How close are we to the first pre-war remarketing campaign?

Uh, waiting on the app. We cannot. Yeah, waiting on the app.

We will not eat the bus. Tranzac, we have another meeting Monday. Can we find a way to have a subtle FJB reference out there?

Yeah, I think just having a red, white, and blue, anything nowadays seems like a subtle FJB. It's kind of sad, huh? I feel like if you see an American flag in front of somebody's house, then you automatically, they have to be conservative.

Pretty sad. DM. Okay, awesome.

We'll check DMs in a second. When does work begin on preparing for DeFi educational materials? Uh, that has started.

Do you have written material for the videos? Has started. Any comment on the gays?

Why don't we talk? Rodeo or drag show? Rodeo.

I won't. Um, there used to be like a place, well they, they call it a brunch place. I don't know, we had more later stuff.

I'd go eat there and they started doing drag shows. Yeah, lost my business. It's a little weird.

I don't know why brunch places, so weird. I don't know why brunch places do that. Like, why is that the thing at brunch places?

Strange. I don't get it. Maybe there's a reason.

Rose can be a nice lady. You guys don't appreciate all the work she does do. How much of any communication or coordination with the baby FJB owners has PPY had throughout this transition?

I think we've had a fair amount. Where that stands is that we'll always do what's best for our holders, what's in the best interest of our holders. Um, that won't ever change.

That's, uh, that's something that, yeah, that's, that's our number one, that's my number one, uh, job is making sure that the organization, uh, the holders, the community, that everything I do is in the best interest of them. Um, which includes obviously security being the top one, but that has not changed, won't ever change. Oh, those are nice.

Golf covers. I gotta, I gotta go hockey bag shopping. Hockey, uh, yeah, hockey bag.

Is that what they're called? I'm pretty sure. Current tax rate, still at 8%.

If, uh, you're selling within 24 hours of buying, is at 16% for the sale. And that is again to protect you all. So we're not having, uh, swing traders taking advantage of this, uh, volume.

Not, it's not so we can make 16%. It's to discourage, uh, that to discourage bots, um, sandwich bots, uh, yeah, essentially just to protect you, the community. So it's not because we want 16%.

It's to, uh, discourage anybody from using sandwich bots to screw with our community. I think that was an excellent feature of our contract. Probably one of the top ones.

Oh, Tim. Oh, I didn't know. I knew Tim golfed.

I was going to say, Tim, you golf? Did you say white paper is still coming this week? Yes.

Ooh, cabinet maker. I do need new cabinets. Is that tax, is that the tax on rate?

Huh? I don't know what that means. Sorry.

Oh, okay. Let's look at discord. Tool boy.

Tool boy's been selling. Who's that? I know.

Who's, who's been selling lately? Somebody that's been here for 800 and something days. I feel like all the wallets are sold today.

Egg is back. Nice to have you, Eggie. He's still sensitive.

I thought, I thought in the new server, he'd be less sensitive, but apparently he's still sensitive. Sorry. Be gentle with the sensitive egg.

Wait, there's a bot to make sandwiches. Who knew? Tool boy says the wife bought 3,000.

Oh boy. Any update on the other on-ramp provider? Yes.

Dev is still on track to be done by Tuesday. However, their, their process might take longer than that. That's all I can say pretty much on that.

Excuse me. So is there a tax at over 24 hours and is the buy tax correct? So if you sell, if you buy right now and try to sell in, say like if you buy right now and try to sell, I don't know, tomorrow morning and say there was a, well, it doesn't matter.

So yeah, if you, sorry, if you buy right now and sell say in a few hours, tomorrow morning or in less than 24 hours, you are going to be charged 16% on that sale. If you buy today and don't sell until Sunday or tomorrow, 25 hours. So anything over 24 hours, 24 hours and one minute, you will be charged 8% sale fee, 8% tax fee.

I hope that makes sense. On-ramp, will they have a license from Louisiana? I'm pretty sure.

Pretty sure they are available in all US states and some international. I will double check on that for you, but I'm almost positive. It's been a, it seems like it's been forever since I checked on that information.

Although realistically probably been like a week or two. Interesting. Does Louisiana have a lot of like strict laws or just crypto?

Oh, look at mayhem with that. I think that's the one who's talking about creating earlier. Oh boy.

I don't know. Huh. Well, don't worry.

Arizona does too. Louisiana crypto laws equals California gum laws. Yikes.

Just joined voice chat. Did you already say how the app is coming along and when is expected to be ready? I can't give you a date on when it's going to be ready for the addition, for the on-ramp that the dev has been working on.

He's still on track to be done by this Tuesday. The company themselves is, may take longer than that on their portion. Mr. GenX57 is quite happy with the couple of thousands we came back to him. Chad says, can we one day have a Patriot Pay sponsored yacht party where they serve exclusively McDonald's nuggets and franks, if for no other reason out of spite. Oh, sounds fun. New York was first, Louisiana was second to adopt crypto law.

Huh. I had no idea. I do remember when we were looking for on-rampers, uh, like two years ago now, we had a lot of difficulties with some states.

Louisiana, I think Texas was a really big one too at the time. I'm not sure if that's still the case. Everyone at work has been telling me to sell.

I replied back, you're selling IRA. They know about your gains, James, and they bought in. Nice job, man.

That's funny. I think, how do we add that? We need to add that to, I wonder how we do that.

We need to add that to the gifts on here and discord. Pretty sure we can do that. No, James says they don't yet.

Not yet. I have a community member that's asking me, well, hold on. Let me share.

Give me a second to make sure. Wait till I get that reply back. Excuse me.

Has there been any thoughts of a DAO for governance, et cetera? No. Okay.

So we have a community member whose house recently burned down and they are asking me to let you all know to not write the seed phrase on paper in the house and expect it to be okay. Actually, while we're on that, and I'll put this in the notes here, but if you are looking for something super simple, here's an option for you that's better than paper. Put the link in both chats and then I'll make sure I write it in the voice notes too.

So you guys have a link to that. But yeah, you can use that instead of paper. A lot better.

And I have, while price is going up, do be careful, please. I'm sure as price continues to hike, if it does, and volume continues, I'm sure we'll start getting more and more scammers in the chat. So please be careful of that.

Remember that me and the admins will never text you first or DM you first. No dev will call you. Nothing crazy like that.

If you ever have a doubt, go ahead and ask in the general chat so we can make sure that you're not being scammed. But definitely don't click on any weird links. Don't share your seed phrase with anybody.

We will never ask for that ever, no matter what. Don't screenshot me or seed phrase. Don't screenshot it to the admins or anything like that.

Don't email it to us or give it to any support. Nobody will ever need that, including TrustWallet, MetaMask, any of that. They won't ever ask you for that for support.

The only time I've needed to use that is if I get a new device and I need to re-enter my information. It's the only time I've had to put in the seed phrase. And then, you know, different kinds of connections I imagine most of you don't really need to use.

So just be very careful and mindful of that. As far as storing your seed phrase example, if you have those metal plates, there's a bunch of other storage options. I've heard of people storing them like they do credit cards, freezing them in the freezer.

I've heard of people putting them in pots, like plant pots, putting them in their yards. People literally have them in pillows or mattresses, but my luck is I'll probably get thrown out if I ever tried that. Another option is you can split them up, split your seed phrase into two maybe.

Just make sure you're very organized about that and have both secure just so that if you misplace it or somebody grabs it, they're not grabbing your entire seed phrase. But again, you just got to be super organized. So definitely feel free to look online or let me know if you have any questions.

But be mindful of that. Make sure you're very careful of that. Oh, that's a nice buy.

$17.73 instead of $17.76. Somebody says I have my, uh, cashew dog, says I have my seed phrase in several separate locations. You're gonna have to burn down the whole city to separate me from my seed phrase. So yeah, just make sure that those are gonna, aren't gonna get in the wrong hands.

I feel like it's a little bit of a balance because you want to make sure that if you lose one, but then you also want to make sure it doesn't get in the wrong hands. It's like, do you want to make, you know, different copies or it's a battle. Hi, Chad.

Sorry I muted you. James says, hid seed phrase. Just has it straight on his truck on a wrap or what?

Referee or refer a master. I was gonna say referee master says anyone can make whatever laws they want wherever they like. I ain't selling anything until I'm jammed, good and ready.

I'm tired of government bullshit. They can pound sand. You have to buy metal stampers with those plates or you can use a dermal.

Probably a lot easier. Playing some cards. Hey, those are some nice, those are like, those are vintage.

Uh, James says he's gonna get it tattooed. Get it tattooed where, where, uh, Weg has his tattoo and you're probably set. Yeah, I know.

That's what I'm saying. The seed phrase. Just get it tattooed where Weg has his tattoo.

That's all I got. Gotta get back to what I'm working on. As soon as I'm off the call.

But yeah, let me know if you guys have questions in the meantime. Oh, I do want to ask for a favor. If you guys do need anything, it would help me out if you start a ticket in Discord versus DM me.

It's just a lot, uh, it's a lot easier to keep track of because once I open a DM in Discord, um, it's no longer, you know, highlighted up there. So a lot of times if I have something pop up, I'll open it and then I'll get pulled away. Then I'll forget to go back to it versus a ticket.

Uh, so that would be very helpful if you guys need anything to do that. Um, titanium doesn't last. Great week.

Yes. Had an amazing week. There's no way I would have thought.

Uh, yeah. No way. So no app until new on ramp ready on their end.

Uh, yes, but do keep in mind that the team who's fixing our smart wallet is, um, working on that still. So the on ramp that our dev is working on along with the third party will likely be done around Tuesday is the estimate we still have will likely be done still before that. Hi.

I don't know who that is. Do you plan on swapping tax wallets soon? I'm not sure.

Why? Fixing smart wallet or shit canning? What?

I don't know what you mean. 1772. I feel like somebody's trying 1776.

That's changing. I don't know who that was. Cute kid.

My wife wants to rescue all the dogs and we can name them seed freeze. Just gotta get the order right. I have four.

You can start with those. Yeah, you do. Are we going to keep the smart wallet?

Oh, I see what you're saying. Um, sorry. I didn't realize.

Hey, your sentence was not clear. Uh, we're going to keep the smart wallet. Uh, yes.

So far we just cause the smart wallet has, you know, it's amazing features. What it has. We just need to get it working and estimating as it should, which has proven to be the most difficult part.

Um, but like everything else we've done, we don't want to cut corners. We do want the best features for you all and the best features that are going to help us, uh, grow the community and the best features that are not found in a lot of these wallets and exchanges and apps that are available everywhere. Um, so, uh, gotta figure out how to do the community town halls on discord.

So it's easier to control these calls. Uh, so actually I think we're going to start broadcasting them from one spot because as we grow for sure, they're not going to be here. They'll be on getter or Twitter.

So that is temporary, but for what it's worth, I think discord is actually having the issue because to have a stage, you need to change the type of server you have. We did try that, but it still wasn't working. It just might take time to update.

James says he's an Oki. I type like I speak and I know what I mean at all times, man. Hey, I feel like that a lot of the times too.

New wallets appeared since we have been on this voice chat. Oh, I actually didn't check if they're new. Oh, that last one looks new.

I know you guys have been DMing me all day with all these new wallets or old wallets selling, new wallets buying, and I've checked when I can check for you guys, but very quickly. Usually people are like, do you know who this is? Uh, they had getter lives before, which worked great.

Yes, especially on a great platform like getter and, um, getter PPY needs to get verified. Yes. Um, and X too, of course, now that they're not censoring everything.

When can we deposit PPY to a tip wallet? Uh, as of today, that's not live yet. I did check very early this morning, um, but they said their dev is working on it.

So as you guys know, a lot of these, uh, seemingly very large companies actually run on like skeleton crew. And I think that's what takes them so long. But I'll let you know as soon as I can, cause I'm waiting to deposit some in there too.

We got some thank yous to give out and tip you guys. It'll be exciting. Um, okay.

Well, I think that's all I have for now. I'm probably going to eat dinner before I post this call cause I'm starving. I had, I had some cheese and I'm going to eat dinner.

Cucumbers before I got on, chopped up a cucumber with like, uh, I don't know what kind of cheese that is. And then I grabbed a glass of wine that I used to cook dinner the other day. Thank you mayhem.

Appreciate it. Trying to get away from that for you. I think it's close enough to give it to them.

I think so too. It's probably Matic fluctuating. All right.

Well, I think that's everything. If you all need anything else in the meantime, I don't think I need to tell you, uh, email, DM, tag, call, text, whatever you need to do. Um, yeah, I'm very excited.

You guys have done a great job. I appreciate it. Uh, I think who was it?

Somebody in telegram keeps saying that, uh, you guys trusted us on a handshake. Um, so I appreciate that. We'll continue building trust and I think as long as we keep our priorities set, we're on a good track.

And we appreciate you guys as patients as we take the time to do everything right and build a foundation to make sure we get all the features, the best features to make us stand out, um, without cutting corners. Uh, I will keep you guys updated on the white paper. I'll keep you updated on the dev, um, the new dev that I hope is coming on because that will be wonderful.

Uh, the search has been a long one to add a solid dev to the team. So we definitely, uh, hope that this helps us things up. Um, yeah, I think that's all.

I think that's all I got y'all. Uh, you guys have a safe night and I will give me a little bit just to get, I think I'm just going to cook some ground beef. I think that's what I have thought out, um, to eat really quick and then I'll go ahead and type some notes and convert these files to get them uploaded, uploaded.

Um, you guys have a good night. I'm sure I will see you in general chat in just a bit.
