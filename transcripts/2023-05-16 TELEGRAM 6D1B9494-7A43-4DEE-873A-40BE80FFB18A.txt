[Speaker 1]
Hello, happy Tuesday. Can you all hear me? It looks like it.

[Speaker 3]
Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Well, it's been a great week so far. It's only Tuesday, but I am feeling very optimistic at the moment in this.

Keep in mind, this can change depending on, you know, just Murphy's law and things get added, things get subtracted, and so on. But at the time we have exactly 40, 40 hours and 40 and a half hours of dev work left to complete this task. I'm super excited about it.

Everything is going wonderful and better than I imagined. So, let me say that again. You dropped out.

Oh, sorry. Is there something wrong with my audio? I'm just updating on the hours of dev work.

We're about, give or take, 40 hours, 40 and a half hours left of dev work to complete this task. Let me know if you're having trouble hearing me. I can disconnect and connect back.

But super excited about that. Like I said, everything's going better than we imagined. So, yeah.

I think I will update you as we get closer and then we'll go from there. How many hours completed? We have several days now.

So, I don't have that on hand, to be honest with you. But most of the work that's already been completed is more so the planning by the team with the dev. Yeah.

So, super excited about that. Yeah. That's it for my big update for you.

I am feeling so much better about everything. And like I said, everything going really better than we even expected. So, that's great news.

Yeah. That's really all the updates I have. Is the team excited, too?

Yes. I think everybody is really super, like I said, everything's been really going better than we imagined. So, yeah.

How are things going with the name change? So, the name change, as soon as that's, the team's been busy with the other task. But as soon as that's 100% completed, that's when we'll start working on the logo.

More so, obviously, to include the name. And get working on that website. From there, of course, that will be more changes in the app after that.

Name is, I don't want to say the name is decided. Because I don't think, like, not 100%. But I think we've pretty much decided.

But once it's on paper, we'll definitely let you know. And at, like, as of right now, I think that will be decided and shared with the community before this task is completed and shared. But that can change, too.

That's the plan right now. I know it's going a lot slower than we expected. But I think that's just how it's gonna kind of go.

Better this way. Keep the pump and dumpers out and get everything done right. I know we're still having some with the app issue.

Like I mentioned before, with the app, the reason we've held off on those changes is we're gonna have to have a lot of changes after the task is completed. And we'd have to redo all that work. So, we're just waiting on it.

Is it one dev that has 40 hours to work or more than one dev sharing the 40 hours? For this task, it is one dev. We wanted to get other devs on to be working on the app at the same time.

But that's, like I said, better to wait. He is open to coming on and taking questions from you all. Right now we're just having him focus on the task and then we'll go from there.

He is not Indian. No, not the same. Same time zone as us.

Well, relatively. A little different, but not opposite with Indian. Is he working full time on it?

He is working as quickly as the team is allowing him to, just because there are a lot of decisions that are being made as we go. Sorry, I just don't want to give away anything. So, not trying to be secretive, but we are still on track to get this done by the end of the month, for sure.

Who is your main point of contact? We have a team chat. Bannon.

I don't know if Bannon is still on the team chat, actually, because I haven't heard him say, although he didn't generally say much, but more so for us. So, you expect name change amounts before tasks completed? That's the plan right now.

As always, that can change, but right now, yes, that is the plan. And to clarify again, as a reminder, that is the name change of the app. So, just because changing the name of the coin, we'd have to pay complete re-listing fees.

A little bit over 100k, I believe.

[Speaker 4]
Bannon exchange.

[Speaker 1]
And as always, please don't share your seed phrase from Vess or from Trust Wallet or anywhere with anybody, please, including me or other admins or your mom. Please don't ever share that with anybody. It's like your bank pin.

And don't enter it in any weird links either. Clarification. Is the 40 hours only the task and not other app fixes, right?

Correct. Yes. Once that task is completed and once we have the name changed, it'll be a lot easier for the devs to go in and do that one time.

Can Dogbone start working on the website to get the ball rolling? So, that's the thing. We can't do that when the website isn't quite 100% on paper change.

But as soon as that happens, we'll have the new domain worked on and also just the other websites to redirect to there. And the same goes for our merch links. Possibly social media, but we'll get that all squared away.

I did say I know it's frustrating still waiting, but I told you it's gonna take time, unfortunately, from, you know, quite a mess. But we're still moving forward when a lot of alts have died down. Not died down, died out, I should say.

Boy, oh my gosh, it's so hot here. We're already in the hundreds. And also once the name and the app is completed, that's when we'll start doing all of our FAQ, um, all of our videos just for basically for FAQs and, you know, the common issues that people have, how-to videos.

That'll be a lot easier to do. Obviously, we don't want to do that now even though we kind of have some downtime to get people hired to do that. It would be a waste because it's going to look different, you know, people are going to get confused even if it's a different logo or whatever.

On the screenshots from the apps or the videos from the apps. Sounds good, need some wins, I know. I know, I'm so ready.

Slow and steady. I know, very, very slow. I know, I'm sorry, but we're still moving forward, so.

After name change and task announced this month, what do you see happening in June? Oh, I think, um, I think June, I think June, July, I think the next few months are going to be very, very busy because there's a lot of things where, a lot of things are waiting on. The task, the name change, um, you know, even the graphics and everything from the app changed.

So, yeah, I think those months are going to be very, very busy. Are you ready to order new gift cards as soon as task is completed? Yeah, definitely.

Our gift cards are, they're, I mean, they're ready right now, but it's, again, with all the changes happening, it'll be just a one-time, uh, editing everything once the task has changed, the name has changed, um, task is completed, sorry. Uh, so, yeah, definitely. Any, um, uh, Trump rally starting again, which is awesome.

Uh, any logos, ideas, any logo ideas yet? Uh, so we have a lot of ideas from a few months ago. Uh, to be honest with you, none that the team has considered, um, or liked enough.

Um, but I don't think our logo will be hard to compete with our current logo. Um, it's not my favorite. I think some of you, or a lot of you agree with that, and especially the colors.

Um, so maybe we should have a contest. A logo. I don't know.

And if one of them is picked, or even if one of them is used to get our logo going. I don't know what you guys think about that. I'm not sure how artistic and creative you all are.

I'm not the most creative or innovative person. You can give me something, and I'll make it, like, a hundred times better. But to think of the original idea, that totally not me.

I used to do that when I used to, um, make, like, cakes and, I don't know, crafty stuff. I have to find the idea, and then I make it, like, the best one.

[Speaker 4]
Somebody else's idea. All you artistic people, I don't know how you do it.

[Speaker 1]
But if you have any logo ideas or any colors, feel free to send them. I remember one that was actually, that's the only one that honestly stands out to me, thinking back. Um, there could have been others, but, uh, it's very similar to the one we have now, but the torch is actually an overlay of the American flag.

Um, I don't know. Maybe there's a way to play around with that to make it more into, like, something that can actually be used as a logo.

[Speaker 3]
The missing dots points on the, um, I think you're just talking about the task that's being worked on, correct? Or is there something else?

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, I had to come out and, uh, I had to come outside and turn off the oven.

[Speaker 1]
A quarter to, oh yeah, so that's, um, the quarter to blocked out. That's actually the task that's being worked on right now. So to answer your question, yes, that will be revealed this month.

As we keep going, if everything keeps going the way it is right now, um, I feel like I always have to give a disclaimer. I'm so sorry. Depending on third parties here, you know, and, you know, just the way Murphy's Law and everything, everything, the way everything works.

Um, but as of right now, yes, that will be revealed this month. If that changes, I will keep you updated. Um, like I said, the dub work, um, we have about 40 hours, give or take, left.

Um, but we can, there are decisions being made as we go. Um, so that's the back and forth. Hopefully that makes sense.

If you are having issues logging in to your app, um, please let me know and I can walk you through just temporarily, uh, retrieving or having access to your wallet through TrustWallet. Uh, if you have your seed phrase, of course, if you don't have your seed phrase written down from the app, please go do that and put that in a safe place. Um, once we have the app all 100% functional, we'll of course make sure you're all taken care of and able to access your account through the app.

Next voice chat Friday? Yes. And by then, uh, I think we'll have quite a bit of work on this task completed and hopefully, you know, change too, but let's see how that goes.

Thank you, Ed. Let me know if you need anything. Can we not have a name?

Yeah, that would be nice. How are people gonna recognize us? Just a symbol.

[Speaker 2]
It's actually not a bad idea.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, did you guys see the, um, well now James O'Keefe, the OMG video now, I was going to say Project Veritas. Um, did you all see the video? I forget who it was, what his title was, uh, confessing that...

[Speaker 4]
I don't know why that reminded me of that. You guys.

[Speaker 1]
So what symbol would it be? I'm guessing that's it. No, but really, if you guys haven't seen it yet, um, James O'Keefe, I forget who the video was with, actually a hidden, obviously a hidden one, um, but had, that he was confessing that Tucker, uh, Carlson was actually fired as a result of that settlement with Dominion.

Crazy, huh? Oh, will transfer tax go away after tax finish? Oh, or task finish, I'm sorry.

Um, that's gonna require a fork, um, and I'm so torn on that, right, because I don't want you guys paying a tax on transfers. Um, however, oh awesome, shared it right there. Um, thanks for the link.

But, you know, that's kind of like the reason that was on there is because then people start doing over-the-counter sales, um, but it's definitely on the list. So I mean, eventually we'd really like to have a much lower task altogether, um, but right now there's really no way for us to change that without forking. Uh, similar to the name change, and what else?

There's a few, there's several things we can't change until we fork, so. Gotta just save up a little bit over 100k, but I think we'll have no problem doing that.

[Speaker 2]
We've done that before with no problems, so I think we'll, uh, have no problem doing that again. Let's start a, like, a getter page. Maybe I'll do that.

Start doing, uh, lives.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know how people do, like, lives to sell. I don't know. I want to say, like, Tupperware, but it's not Tupperware.

I'm going to start doing that and selling, uh, FJD merch and FJD gift cards.

[Speaker 2]
Or TikTok for a quick amount of money.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe on the getter. Banning on the getter live on the FJD channel? I know.

That's what I'm going to do. Or get him to get on live. Autograph some merch for us.

I thought that was a picture for a second, but it's just a gift. Oh, that was very delayed on my end. That's why.

I need you guys' energy. Actually, this week has been, I can't believe it's only Tuesday because we've gotten so much work done this week. It's not really even the end of Tuesday.

It's just going to, like, be Tuesday. Oh, on my end. How's P6?

I keep meaning to text him, and I always remember in, like, a very long time, like, when I'm driving. Let's see.

[Speaker 4]
P6. Is that Nolan also on my WTC? Where is Nolan?

[Speaker 1]
Natalie Winters on TimCast? Ooh. I saw Carrie Lake was just on there.

Um, but I didn't watch it.

[Speaker 2]
Nolan.

[Speaker 1]
Nolan's in the Targaryen. A little early for him, though. It just takes, like, a few hours here and there.

I want to see Nolan's future wifey. She's probably hot, because all of your wives are hot. I don't know how, but Nolan said it's you guys' personalities, so.

[Speaker 4]
It is. Nolan's our little robot.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like Nolan's grown a lot in our FJB time. It makes me think that Nolan's pretty young. Mm-hmm.

All right, y'all. I think that's it. If you have any issues, please DM me or tag me in the chats.

Again, please don't give your seed phrase to anybody. It breaks my heart to learn anytime one of you shares it with somebody pretending to be me or pretending to be admins. And also, don't put it in any sketchy links.

If you are ever in doubt, ask me or ask anybody in the chats. Yeah, probably, actually. Better probably in the chat, yeah, because if somebody's DMing me or DMing you and you think it's me, then you think you're asking me or any of the other admins.

So, if you're ever in doubt before giving your seed phrase to a link or a person, which you should never give it to a person, please ask. We haven't had that for a while, so I feel like it's gonna happen, which is why I feel like I've been repeating it a lot. I know what happens on our off days.

Hi, Sarah. Can you give a recap of the call and an update, please? Yeah, so this week's gone great.

Dev has about 40 hours left of work done to complete a task. Although he is working full time, some of that time in between his work is the team making decisions as they come up, so I can't really give a time, you know, as in like, oh, by this Friday or this many days, but we are still on track for the task to be completed by the end of the month. If that changes, I will let you know.

I will keep you updated, but as of right now, that's the plan. We are still on track to complete the task by the end of the month and to announce it, as well as the name change of the app. Again, that could still change.

We still have a few weeks left till the end of the month, and if that does change or we do have some hiccups, I will share those with you. Yeah, I do appreciate your patience, as always. I told you it was gonna take some time, and man, it's taken more time than I anticipated, even, but we're getting there, slowly but surely.

Appreciate your patience with that. Yeah, as far as June, July, August, I think the next few months will be very, very busy because we have a ton of tasks waiting on these few changes. Yeah, but we'll keep you updated.

We'll update the roadmap as we see fit, and everything will start slowly but surely being a lot more organized and ready for new holders as they join us. But I think that's all. As always, DM me, tag me if you need anything.

Thank you again for your patience. Yeah, honestly, super excited and really a lot more hopeful than I've felt in a long time. Everything is really, truly going better than expected, which is great, great news.

Oh yeah, also, MP, the dev, said he will do a Q&A with the community, so we have that on the docket. I'm not sure when. Maybe it would be best after a task is completed, actually.

Yeah, so I think that'll be nice, too, because I know some of you have much more technical questions than I can answer, so thank you so much. Have a great night and a great week. I'll see you there.
