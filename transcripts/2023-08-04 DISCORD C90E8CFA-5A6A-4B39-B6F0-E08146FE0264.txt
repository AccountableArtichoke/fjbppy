Recorder on and going in case anybody wants to listen to it. Um, even though I don't really have any updates Hope you've all had a great week The dev is still testing Actually as I said that a message Going great so far Everything is testing as it should Um With I think I did update you guys on Tuesday He is or he was trying to optimize the fees that's been a huge concern from the get-go for a lot of changes because if the Fees are going to be so high that kind of defeats the purpose of us having these super cool features You know and telling everybody. Oh my gosh You know, we have all these features and nobody else has and then nobody uses them because the fees are just so insanely high so That's why the testing Has taken longer than expected Because he is really trying to optimize those fees and make them as low as possible so that Not only you guys but new users And as we grow the community new users aren't paying these insane fees and Basically sears everybody away from using a really cool feature so That's where he's at with that Everything else so far with the testing has gone as expected. So that's great news That's really awesome Has the dev got a deadline for testing No, so he does not we want him to get everything darn near perfect So if he has and this is why he's had to go back and work on Things after he tests them and they're not going the way we like or the fees aren't as low as we like He's had to go back and work on some stuff so if he has to you know, keep working on these features to make sure that We have a quality product with quality features That will be attractive to again Not only our current holders, but future holders of both the coin and the app We Really want to get it right this time.

I know it's Taken much longer than expected But I think that's better than having you know Getting all ramped up and having another wire situation or anything like that. We just want to cross our T's Dot our I's make sure everything is gosh-near. Perfect And just as perfect as we possibly can get it to have a successful launch and We'll discuss obviously the features as they're live, but the team we have is really thinking about every little detail And I think that's why things have just taken longer than expected.

They're not Our team isn't settling And they're not just trying to push a product out to have a quick Pump and dump and then you know, everybody forget about us. They really are Focused on making this a product With the highest success rate for the long term Actually, what's really cool share this with you guys the The dev actually Just text that or just shared that As he was testing some things happened in real time That worked out really well Again, I'll share more about that later. But super super neat and super cool.

Like I said our team we have a brilliant team Who's really focused on getting the Right product and has to make sure every detail is thought of Has he given an estimate to complete? No, not this week. I Will let you guys know as soon as I have an estimate Although you've seen kind of how that Plays out, you know again if there's issues, we're not just going to launch to launch and You know and wait till next week till we have more issues A second, I think MP and telegram Okay These are a few questions from a telegrammer After 40 hours of required testing How is it that we are approaching week four without an update other than testing going well and I'll update you and I have an Update I think I just explained all that Testing You know, there's the testing, we test things for a reason. So testing was supposed to take 40 hours and the fees were way too high. Sure, we can go ahead and continue and just launch, but that's going to be a useless product.

So the dev has to make some changes. So that's kind of how we go from 40 hours to now, several weeks. You mentioned on 7-28 that it should be live with a week.

What has happened to missed delivery? I think that has the same answer there. Given what has occurred since the redacted roadmap you shared in March, with promises of delivery most months following, when can we expect to learn of the task this month?

I will update you as soon as I have that answer. Again, you know, that's changing. That's how testing goes.

We test to make sure everything goes as smoothly as the team wants it. And if it doesn't, the team is not willing to settle and just let it go. Again, they are thinking of every detail and their number one priority is to make this, to give us the highest chance of success for the long term.

Otherwise it's going to be, I think, even more difficult to grow the community. You mentioned that reflections are no longer a feature of the task. Why and what is happening in place of reflections?

I think we'll review all that once we're live, but I think a good place to start on answering that is current events, mainly with XRP and the SEC. You've mentioned that there may be other features being worked on. It seems a secret task is always changing.

Will there be more changes or has the team finally settled on what the features are going to be delivered? No. So first question, will there be more changes?

No, not if testing continues going smoothly as it has. The changes have happened because of real world current events or third party providers. And that's out of our control.

Some of the changes were changes we really wanted to make and just couldn't due to third parties and different platforms and compatibilities. And other changes that have been made have been for the greater good of the community, current and future, and I think changes that you all will be very happy about. No changes have been made just to like string everybody along and have us waiting.

Oh yeah, Publy though kind of answered the reflections right there. Let's see. Yeah, answered that regarding security.

What has more issues, App or Sarah? Interesting, okay. I don't know what issues.

Okay, so those were answered there. I don't see anything looking through my inbox. Make sure I don't have any other questions.

I think that's it. Yeah, again, the, you know, everything, hopefully this coming week. Again, everything for the task is not going to be, I don't think, some new idea to anybody.

These are all things that you've all wanted for a very long time and I think everybody will be very happy. We're just, again, I think having so many features. I forget, the dev actually said something this week.

If I can find it. But yeah, there are countless features all together. We've had to jump through many hoops to get them all included.

And now I see why we don't see these features every day. But we'll get there. And again, that's, you know, that's how testing goes.

And again, we can just settle and go for it and just launch and it really just be completely useless if nobody's using it. Or we can continue making sure that every little detail is thought out. And if it's not possible, then we do what we can to work around it, whether that means dropping the feature completely or, you know, doing something else.

The dev just said, aren't you glad with this result? He probably doesn't know I'm on voice chat and Discord. He's wondering why I'm reading his messages and not replying.

Ooh, where's that? JROC. It looks a little bit cooler than here.

Although we've had a cool week. Comparatively, yeah. It's been pretty awful.

What is it? 111 right now. All right.

I think that's everything. Yeah. DM me if you need anything else.

Or tag me or any of the admins. Remember, don't send us. Awesome.

Perfect. I will upload the recording right now in case anybody still wants to listen to it. And, yeah.

Again, I'm super excited. I will. Yeah, I'm super excited about everything even the dev just shared in the last few minutes.

I told him, sorry, I'm on a voice chat. I was wondering why I'm reading it. Aren't you glad with the results?

He knows I get super stoked when stuff is going well. Perfect. Please remember, don't share your seed phrase.

Don't click on any weird links and don't send anybody money, including admins. If anybody messages you first, it's likely not an admin. It's likely a fake profile.

Whether it's me or Ed or JB or anybody else. We will never message you first if you're ever in doubt. Please ask in the general chat.

I know we all have off days and I feel like every time somebody's been scammed, like when they were sick or going through a divorce or something like that. So, yeah. Please watch out for that.

And I will talk to you all soon. Have a great night. I'm going to go to our neighbors.

A few houses down tonight. So, they have a pasta night. Except I'm celiac, so we'll see how that goes.

I'll talk to you guys soon. Have a great night.
