For people to really like watch the chart closely every single minute and to be like tremendously impatient and the whole nine yards like, you know, like that's okay. I guess that's people's mindset, but I really do believe that everybody here, I know we only have 114 people here tonight, everybody here, the 6,000 plus we have in the Discord, the 6,000 plus we have in the Telegram, all the followers that we have on socials, all the coin holders, all the people that are War Room listeners. I think you guys all understand that this is not like an overnight fix.

It's not like an overnight thing where it's like, oh, you're going to wake up tomorrow and it's going to be, the coin is going to be whatever. You know what I mean? It doesn't work like that. You have to keep building, keep building, keep building. 

And that's what we're doing. We're putting in all this work. I wouldn't be in here if I didn't believe in this project. 

That would have been long gone. Don't you know that? Like I'm not going anywhere and I haven't gone anywhere because I love this project so much and I love this coin more than anything. And I see this, like Boris and Steve said, as being a top 50 coin. 

Like that's why I'm here because I have that vision. Everything that I've promised on has come through. And for me to still be up here, being enthused, having this enthusiasm, being excited, being passionate, still doing a Sunday night talk. 

It's, it's, you know, you know, you know that like this thing is, is on the right path. You like, so just take a step back. Sorry, discord voice. 

Right after this, they have a call right after this for the coin. You know what I mean? I can't like type and talk. However, I have a call for the coin right after this. 

It's supposed to be at eight 20. I got on a little bit late. And now I'm doing discord voice. 

So Sunday night, what I like to do is just talk about what was important over the weekend, over the weekend. And since last time was, as you guys know, that rally, the rally was awesome. There's a lot of things going on. 

This week is going to be awesome. It's going to be a really, really great week. I'm tremendously excited. 

All of you guys that are still sticking around and being here is, is, is really incredible. And I just, I couldn't be happier for you guys all to be here. And I'm just, I can't wait to talk again on Wednesday and see, see how everybody's doing.

(2:29 - 3:28)
I just, I love talking to you guys and I love doing this. Yeah, absolutely. Like I, there's not much else to say. 

Just, I'm just excited. My passion and my enthusiasm for this project has not strayed away. Has not at all. 

Everybody have a great night. I'm going to keep this short and simple. They keep this short and simple. 

Keep working hard, keep shilling, keep going, keep pushing forward, keep fighting for this country. We're going to talk again soon, very, very soon. And I just, I watched a great movie Norbert. 

It was, it was hilarious. So if you guys have some time tonight, I'd recommend you watch that. Everybody have a great one. 

Take care, brush your hair to rock, maybe eat a Frank, take a little break, take a nap, get, get some sleep. Donny, sleep in everybody. Very excited. 

Thank you guys all for being here and FJB, baby.
