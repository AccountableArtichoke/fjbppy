(0:03 - 23:24)
Good morning, happy Saturday. I'm re-recording because I totally forgot to record yesterday. I was actually My mind was on a call I was waiting on so I missed that so my apologies for that But there's a lot of questions to answer so it would have been a while to type everything up So I'll just re-record. 

I hope you're having a great weekend so far I don't have any major updates. Like I said in the voice chat announcement However, everything on our end is still going very smoothly even better than expected very quickly And everything's looking great. Everything's finally coming to live and since a lot of it a lot of what we're working on It Like it's just sequential in a way like the devs can't work on You know Y until X is complete So that's wonderful because we have the devs started I believe it was Thursday now on the next project and And then we have them Then we have them starting on we're waiting on quotes and then we'll pick Out of the three dev teams for this next one that will start this weekend So that's that's all going great I will keep you updated of course as everything Progresses as far as questions, I don't think I've received any on discord I know somebody messaged me on there regarding the XD transfers Did go ahead and send you a reply as soon as I was on the off the call So check for that. 

I did receive some questions on telegrams So we'll go through those first and then I'll go back to the discord chat to see if there's any in there I didn't answer yet Um So an excuse the background noise, I'm not in My office because this is like my morning area before the dogs all wake up. So the Roombas are running in the background Hopefully that's not gonna be too annoying. Okay, so I'll go through this What's the status of the app is it now launch ready? The app is going very well fixed transactions have been fixed on our end. 

We're not deploying that yet the devs have been testing it and then they Fixed other things while they're in there and they've moved on to the next project in there So that's all going very well If not, what are the challenges what has been added? There's no challenges at the moment as far as that goes fixed or failed transactions are finally fixed Like I said, you won't see it on your end Because we have not deployed that yet. I'll let you know as soon as the devs deploy that What has been added you will find out once that's complete as far as everything else goes Has the audit team implemented or recommended and agreed changes? We've had no changes actually On our major project, so that's great news If not, when will this be finalized? Yeah, everything everything there is Finalized is there a still need for a second review if there is has this started and when will it be completed? We've actually Decided that that's not going to happen right now. We've changed a few things around so I will let you know Do that. 

Have you spoken to the third party recently? Yes This week I want to say it was midweek. Are they ready to commence work immediately? Yes. Will they still require? Excuse me up to 10 days That has not changed, but they are ready to start work immediately Sorry trying to get my caffeine in Okay, is there any outstanding legal work that needs to be completed? Yes. 

How long will this take? We have something we're waiting on in the next five to seven business days I also got the call I was waiting for from the attorney last night Actually right a right off right after oh my gosh, I can't do voice chats at 5 a.m Right after I got off the discord voice And then I'm waiting For something else from the attorney that I should be receiving before Wednesday. So Very exciting everything is going on on that and There is nothing Really that should Go Sketching this out. Are we on track for a November review as it stands right now? Yes If and as you know that's changed but I I do feel very confidently We're gonna have everything we were originally shooting for and more But again the number one priority stands a tie, you know the time Is definitely not The number one priority number one priority is really doing the most we can to make sure We have everything within our power For the highest chance of success and of course maintaining security I Understand a lot of you are getting frustrated with the timing, but I'm sorry. 

That is not the number one priority Probably not the number two priority It definitely is a priority because I understand it, you know, you guys want to reveal But we are thinking long term and That's you know that that hasn't that hasn't changed We've got to get it right this time. This is not to say again by definition of everything this is not to say that things won't pop up and we won't get through them and Get you know everything, right? however What week from what we can control and everything? You know trying to get everything aligned that we can foresee happening wrong is number one priority and That That has not changed we can't afford to go live and Have you know stuff hit the fan so And of course, you know that remains it's your money. You can sell you can buy back in later You can you know, you can not buy back in later but that has not changed as far as Security and getting it all right As as things have changed there's been so many changes Outside changes that we can't control as this progresses, but also like example with the app Going into the app, you know the devs go into failed transactions. 

Well, then they find one thing after another and We can Continue kind of just duct taping these little things just to just you know, get it just get it done for now but in the long run it Gonna cause us more of a headache like it has in the past like it has up to this point And since we do have the funds, which is amazing We have chosen to have the devs actually Get how do I say this? Basically just Do it the right way So even if it takes longer time To do it. We're not just duct taping everything they find So that's that's a prime example right there with the failed transactions So I hope that helps you understand everything else As Far as that goes and that's honestly how we've approached Everything more recently because we do have the funds and again the timing of this launch is not the number one priority Getting everything right so that we don't launch, you know day one and volume picks up and the app breaks again Or something happens here and again This is not to say stuff won't go wrong You know stuff I'm sure will and by definition stuff will go wrong and we'll get through it But if we but if something we can Get fixed right now. We are doing that and we're having the devs do that and doing it, right so it doesn't keep popping up and Doing what it has up to this point. 

So I hope that clarifies a little bit Okay, the next question sorry, I'm just going down this If app is not ready, will you still proceed with the task reveal? Yes, that Hasn't changed it would be nice to have the app for sure however, that's The task reveal is not dependent on that At task reveal where there be action required from all current holders no, but I will let you know if that changes again, you don't need to do anything if If if anything you doing something will Mess us up That makes sense. So just just leave it alone. Just don't touch it No, we will we'll keep you updated if that changes our B&B planning on recording a message for the group at task review I'll keep you updated on that. 

Is there anyone joining you on an upcoming voice chat? Not so far. Somebody last night did ask if our Crypto advisor would be willing to jump on a call. I have not asked him that yet Not that any of you would know his voice. 

I mean, of course well, but So, yeah I'll let you know I can ask him and see how he feels about that. Maybe there's like a voice muffling app or something Let me go into the questions from last night's Discord general chat to see if there I think there was some questions in here Has third party been given the green light Ed says no But they just speak to them this week letting them know We'll be contacting them very soon when they're ready how many devs are actively working now Excuse me, we have one two, three, four I counted this last night and I think I came up with 11, but I'm not sure. So one two, three, four working on this One two working on that one, two Three Nine, I'm coming up with nine now So I don't know if I'm remembering wrong with last night or if it's too early to think of everybody So I have four here two there one there and two there So, I don't know I'm sure somebody will correct me but hopefully I'm remembering the same as I did last night I don't know why last night I thought I had 11. 

Anyway, nine Again we have what the project that started on Thursday, which is going Well so far and then we're waiting on quotes from three different dev teams this weekend to get started ASAP on the next Project so super excited. I am very excited that we're able to do that now with obviously the help of having the funds and Just Us being able to do that because the devs can't work on this, you know on X if Y isn't completed and stuff like that So it's finally Got the ball rolling and I feel like we're finally in Just a good We're finally just a good flow Which is great. We found some amazing amazing devs. 

We have backup backup backup devs. I'm just in case Because I'm super paranoid about that now, but everybody we're working with is absolutely amazing And I'm very excited about that What else When do you expect to give third-party the green light? I'm not sure right now, but I will Maybe If failed transactions get fixed soon, are you waiting for task reveal before releasing those fixes? So again, the failed transactions have been fixed. They've just been testing them to make sure that You know nothing can break Or cause the failed transactions again The devs are oh the devs are also working on Making sure that the failed transaction issue Does not continue happening, right? so a lot of that a lot of that Those features that are on the front end with you and the smart wallet seem so simple with a smart wallet the smart wallet actually My birds going a little crazy the smart you come here Has the smart wallet has to estimate? How much gas? The user is using right so what ends up happening and the gas it uses is actually from the operator wallet Okay, so the operator wallet is a wallet. 

We have access to that. We can manually put gas in So what happens is the operator wallet? pays the gas for this user right But it will charge them whatever that amount of gas is from their transaction say they're Selling FGB. It's gonna take extra FGB out of that transaction too So that that user can pay the operator wallet back in more simple terms. 

No, my bird is getting kisses Sorry about the background noise Hopefully this won't be too annoying to listen to So what you're doing, you know, the operator wallet pays for your gas then when you're selling say your FGB It's gonna take some extra FGB so that you can pay back the operator wallet and deposit that FGB back in the operator wallet I'm not sure if it stays as FGB Talk to the devs about that Now what's happening right now? Is that estimate in the code is wrong? It's not charging the User enough gas. So what's gonna end up happening? Is that the funds in the operator wallet are being? depleted when that happens that operator wallet is going to Need us to or somebody to deposit keep depositing gas funds in there that defeats the whole purpose of the Smart wallet and the user being able to pay for their own transaction So this is one of the reasons that they fail transactions keep happening and now they're working on a better Way for those estimates to happen so that it can make those estimates correctly so that we don't run into that issue again So that's been that's that's being worked on several other things of why transactions were failing Have been fixed. So again, this is something in the past. 

We've just You know just put more funds in there and just duct tape it and move on just to get through everything quickly But this time around we really want to get things fixed for the long run so we don't continue having these same issues So hope that shines a little bit of light on why? Things like this are taking a little bit longer with so many devs working on them As far as when we'll deploy the fixed transactions in the app I will keep you updated on that Likely, it'll be at least until the devs can fix that estimation For the guests Will tasks go live and then a voice chat to announce or will Go live during the voice chat. We've not decided on that yet, and it's Changed back and forth a few times. So I will keep you updated on that Will the crypto advisor ever come in voice chat, I think I answered that earlier Definitely can ask him eventually we need a crypto advisor to show to the tech nerds What happened oh, yeah get your coins off XT Please again You will not be charged the 8% on either your XT wallet or the wallet you're transferring to if you need any help with that Please DM me tag me email me We are not responsible for your coins if you leave them on XT and XT decides to do Whatever they do they disappear or you run out of time. 

So please just do that ASAP They only charge you I think around 8,000 FGB a little bit over that to transfer them out and then you can transfer them out to a trust wallet or Your app wallet do that ASAP Please because I think I'm only getting that notice a few more times and then we'll send an email and then you're on your own Okay Are you looking are you guys looking at beyond task now? Yes. Yes. Yes. 

Yes the depths It's been awesome to be able to move on to the other projects and actually have certain projects completed now Okay, I think that was all the questions I got on Telegram and discord. I did check emails last night, but I can't even check right now. Sometimes people send Yeah, I don't have anything else so I Think that's everything. 

Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime get your coins off XT get your funds off wire I've got some questions about that If you have your coins in the app and the FGB app You have your FGB coins in the FGB app or any other coins that you purchase from wire then you are good however, there are people who Between the time they made their purchase They never actually received their coins and wire still has those funds If that's the case you do have till December 3rd. I do recommend that's that what about 30 days away I do recommend doing that as soon as possible because wire will likely Transfer you from one department to another so please make sure you do that ASAP if you need any help Please let me know and I can help with that But please same with XT if you need any help, please let me know and I can help you with that But time is running out on that. We are not responsible for any coins or funds as you know So let me know If you need any help with that, but please move your coins ASAP Again, I'm only giving that Notice a few more times till you're completely on your own And we don't know when they'll pull the plug as far as XT goes, you know with wire. 

It's December 3rd. Gobble gobble gobble gobble It's kind of weird that November starts and my birds start saying gobble gobble gobble gobble Pretty sure she did this last year What's so funny What's so funny Okay Where are you I'm here Where are you All right. I think that's everything.
