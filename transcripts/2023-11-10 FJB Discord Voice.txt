(0:00 - 5:13)
Let me get the recorder going. Happy Friday! I hope you've had a wonderful week. It's been wonderful on our end, minus me having to wake up even earlier than I usually do to get with devs in India and Lebanon. 

So everything is still going very, very smoothly, which is wonderful. Actually, I may, if I need to get off for a little bit, it'll be because I'm waiting on a call, so it'll be because I received a call, but I should be fine. So everything's going very smoothly. 

We're a lot closer. The devs are still working on what they started a few days ago, and that is still on track to be completed by Monday, Tuesday. This has nothing to do with the task, per se. 

This is just more dev work, mainly app work of functions on the app. And once that's complete, again, Monday or Tuesday, they'll be starting on the next task. We actually went back and forth on getting a different dev team to work on that, but they kind of coincide with each other, so we think it would be a little bit more of a mess, and it would cause more of a headache. 

With just us hoping to save time, we think it might actually do the opposite. So that same team will begin once they've completed this phase. So that's super, super exciting. 

Lots of changes coming to that. The other dev team that's working on another app-related change, but just definitely something in a different realm, I guess. They're still on track. 

Everything's going well. We had a great meeting, and everything's still going as expected there. That's really it. 

It's not a lot to share when everything's going as expected. Yeah, I think that's all I got. I'll see if I have any questions and DMs. 

I don't think I saw any coming in today, but let me know if you did DM me. I'm checking the archives. No, I don't think I've received anything. 

I'll check the email just in case. Get your coins off XT. That's probably going to be the last few times I mention that. 

We cannot help you once they decide they will not help you. So get those off there definitely as soon as possible. If you know anybody that passed away, very sadly, I hate that I have to even bring this up, but I know we've had people with family members come in that had somebody pass away who had FJB. 

Do make sure you check with them in case they didn't check like an XT app on their phone or on their laptop and just checked something like the basic trust wallet or the FJB app. I thought of that a few days ago. Also get your funds off wire if you do still have funds on there. 

Again, if your coins are on the app, you're good, or if you transferred out of the app into trust wallet or what have you, you're fine. It's only the people who made the purchase through wire and did not receive their coins and your funds just got stuck with wire. Please get that done before December 3rd. 

They won't be able to help you after that. And then again, I recommend getting that done as soon as possible because wire seems to transfer you more often than not through several departments before they can take care of you. But let me know if you need me to help with that too, please. 

Let's see. I did redownload my Discord app, so I'm back to getting notifications again, which has been nice. Good point. 

We've got to find out Frode King's wife. Oh, I know. I just found out he passed. 

I didn't know that. So definitely find out if he had an XT account because he possibly had both too. So just because they found some on Trust Wallet or the FJB app, just because there is a substantial amount that XT has essentially moved to their own account. 

So we really cannot help you with that. Again, repeating that over and over and over. I think we've given quite enough notice now, so please do that just so XT doesn't take those.

(5:17 - 8:00)
So what are we waiting on before reveal since the devs are working on other tasks not needed for going live? The two dev teams are working on the app. Our main dev, who built most everything for the task, is just wrapping it up in a pretty package to send to our third party. That is it. 

So it's very exciting. Very, very exciting. Yeah, that's it. 

We're at that step. So perfect. Thank you, Russ. 

That's it as far as that goes. Should be exciting. It should be exciting. 

And then definitely one of our partners, I think they're also wrapping up their side of things. So that should be cool. But yeah, I think y'all will be very excited. 

The video is getting wrapped up for the announcement. So super, super cool. So I guess this has kind of been, had lots of attorney calls this week regarding the donation aspect of the app, the political donations. 

And we've been going back on that for quite a while now. What makes it tricky is just that everybody has a different law. There's a federal law, and then every state has a law. 

And it's just so much. Basically, it comes down to $50. So under $50, a donation could be anonymous. 

So crypto, under $50, you could do it. Say you have a $49 donation, you're okay, you're good to go. Now, say you came on the app and did one donation, 49 bucks, say you did it to Donald Trump, and then you wait a week later, and then you do another $49 donation to Donald Trump. 

Well, we would get in trouble for that. So basically, we would just have to find a way to prevent that. And how we're thinking of doing that is just making sure that when you sign into your FJB app, that you only have your one account, and that one account can only donate to one party.

(8:04 - 8:16)
So that's what it comes down to. But otherwise, we get in trouble for that. So yeah, that's been our biggest, I guess, hurdle this week, which was not bad at all.

(8:17 - 10:01)
I think I'll still take that. How long will it take for the old dev? Oh, hi, Fizz. Oh my gosh, I'm like having flashbacks. 

How long will it take for the old dev to put everything in a nice little package for third party? I'm not sharing timeline anymore. It's getting too close for that. I gotta surprise you guys. 

That's also why I started doing the voice chat announcements like really early on. Maybe I need to start having them in different times now. I only did it an hour earlier today. 

Well, I think I told you guys, we might start doing it an hour earlier anyway, because you all have daylight savings and I don't. So for me, it's still the same time right now at 430. But I'm fine if 530 works better for everybody. 

I'm fine doing that. I have a neighbor's game night thing tonight, so I don't want to be too late for that. That's why I had it at 430 plus I'm waiting on a call. 

I think the political donations would be really cool. We just got to get through the political hoops or the laws for donating. So again, as long as we can find a way to make it, you know, make sure you're only donating once to each candidate, then we're good. 

So that's kind of where that is right now. But I will update you if that changes. Everything else that we wanted has been wonderful.

(10:02 - 11:05)
So that's great. What else? I don't have any emails from users with any questions either. I should have an update soon about so that's the thing with us going revealing task rate is so the app task doesn't depend on the app being complete, especially with all the changes we're making. 

However, TPUSA does depend on the app. I would hate for us to pay five figures to get a booth and all the other cool stuff at TPUSA if our app is not working. So that's where we're at as far as that goes.

(11:07 - 12:01)
Yeah, but I will keep you guys updated. And yeah, with how really cool and detailed the task is, it's making the app work take a little bit longer now that they finally figured everything out and, fixed all the failed transactions and they've fixed all the bugs they know of or that we knew of before they started working on it. And of course, I'm sure once you all start testing it, we'll probably find some new ones. 

That's how that works. But as far as the bugs that we're all aware of and the login issues and the Facebook, Google pages randomly popping up, the spinning blue circles, all that, that's all been fixed. Failed transactions.

(12:03 - 13:29)
But again, the task integration into the app, and that does not, again, task does not depend on that. So we're totally fine as that goes. But for TPUSA, obviously we want to have the app. 

When you're doing these live events and marketing, are you really pushing the fact that Bannon owns it? Yes. Yes. And what was surprising about the last event I did around Halloween, I think it was Saturday before Halloween, was last time, which was crazy because this event wasn't a political event. 

And of course, it was in a very conservative town. However, the last event we went to was that Cary Lake event. So very, very political event, obviously. 

And at that time, not everybody knew who Bannon was when I asked. And this time, it wasn't a political event, and everybody knew. I mean, I think there's maybe, like, I could probably count on one hand, the people that said they weren't sure of who he was. 

So that was really cool. And I think that's obviously, I think that's obvious in how much growth he's had in the last few years. So that's really cool.

(13:30 - 15:06)
But yes, absolutely, absolutely pushing that. I know somebody DMed me that the website on Bannon's getter was gone. So I checked on that. 

That was not the case. It is still there. But yeah, that's where that goes. 

I've gotten some screenshots from me being shared. So with that, sometimes with us being in the internet space, sometimes having people on the team that believe the team, they will have some info. And that's where that's where all that came from. 

What else? I think that's the only DM. Oh, somebody got kicked out. What? Okay, somebody got banned from telegram. 

Just DM, DM whoever banned you guys. You're grown. You're grown men.

(15:06 - 16:01)
DM whoever banned you and speak to them. I don't know who banned you. Whoever banned Dan. 

Dan Hannibal. Okay. What else? Any other questions? I feel like I haven't seen any of the female holders more recently. 

I did see Stacy the other day. Other than that, I feel like I'm the only one here. I'm having a coffee super late.

(16:01 - 17:38)
I don't know how I'm gonna stay up. I've been up since 1.30. Any other questions? Oh, our website is still so I know you see it forwarding the domain website that we're transferring it from and who we're transferring it to which we're transferring it to epic which is absolutely amazing. If you have a website definitely they're like very conservative and very pro freedom. 

So if so you'll you'll see that PatriotPay.org redirects you to apparently Mitt Romney had something called PatriotPay. Who knew? I didn't know that. I don't think any of us did but that should be there's something going in the background going wrong with the DNS and both parties are just having us wait until the 14th. 

We'll wait until the 14th which makes it seven business days since we transferred it and then they can see if it doesn't actually transfer through. So we are aware of that issue. It's very strange since the other website that we transfer the other domain that we transferred transferred right away within a few hours like they're supposed to but something with the DNS and that forwarding so we are aware of that and both both of the companies are very aware of that and we're just following their advice to wait these seven days before they see if something else is wrong.

(17:40 - 21:35)
Usually it doesn't take this long but but thank you for your patience with that. Last I checked the website and what still had FGB stuff in it. Yes there's some until we get new material on there it's going to have some of the old if that's what you're talking about like the Bannon videos and just other mentions of us basically is that what you're talking about? Oh thank you. 

That's so sad I didn't know Road King even passed. I heard Jax was around too. That's exciting because I know he was having some health issues. 

I'm sad. Awesome thank you Russ. If you want you can give her so we're waiting for our Patriot Pay domain email because of the transfer but you can give her this one too if that's easier for her or you can just give her my phone number too if that's whatever's easiest for her really. 

Awesome thank you. I think going live without forking for suicide everyone already has a negative view of FGB crypto and just to save a few exchanges in those exchanges people would have to know that FGB is linked to Patriot Pay. Yeah I totally understand. 

I totally understand but you'll see once I think I think you'll change your opinion once you see what it all entails. I think you'll change your opinion about every little detail that was very carefully thought out and again this does not mean that like textbook definition we're going to have some hiccups so please expect that. We are expecting that. 

That doesn't mean that the devs didn't do their due diligence, doesn't mean that our team didn't do their due diligence, that's just expected. Again very very very expected like I mentioned before but every detail was very well thought out and we'll have you guys test everything too. What's wonderful is we also added some sort of almost like an insurance policy if you will for lack of better terms so it'll it'll be great. 

I'm very excited to finally show you all and again even the video that will help explain everything. Aren't we expecting Apple App Store to just cancel us right away? No, why? Why are you wishing that on us? We've been with Apple for quite a while now. Going on... uh was it February or April? We've been going on two years.

(21:37 - 22:36)
Yeah that's true they do. Actually in the uh so when Apple takes your app off the App Store uh or gives you like some uh red flags that you need to check you can go through and one of the one of the reasons in their checkbox is um is like the political a political reason like to just basically send in a um complaint to let them know that the reason they're uh that you think they've removed you was and they appeal it as that the reason being political motivation or something along those lines so at least they're aware it happens. MJ do not wish that on us as long as we follow all guidelines.

(22:38 - 23:44)
They're usually pretty good though they usually give you um like things you need to change you just go through and basically do what they tell you but there's I mean there's some conservative apps on there um political apps but worse comes to worse you know we still have our web app we could do app.fjbcoin.org which uh we once the website rolls through um the domain is completely switched over then that will be changing too to app.patriotpay.org so that should be cool too. Excited to say the least. I should be seeing more of these video this week or this weekend.

(23:45 - 39:22)
I'm really excited for that too. So um for this weekend devs will still be working full time to get uh this completed by Monday, Tuesday they said the latest so again as soon as they're done with that they'll start the next phase um that phase is estimated to take a week and a half to two weeks so that will put us around Thanksgiving time which is when our project by the other set of devs is scheduled to finish so far again still on time um yeah and the task doesn't is not dependent on any of these FYI but hopefully we'll have this part completed by Thanksgiving I think that would be really cool um which would be the app at least for testing um I think that would be really awesome but we'll see how that goes and I mean that says you the community testing it not not dev testing so what's the task you'll find out you'll find out when we release the video and probably do a voice call I don't know maybe do we need to do a random but then if we do a random time then you guys are gonna know do the same time but then I'm not sure that means I have to make sure the devs are available I need to make sure our advisors available I'm pretty much always available so that's fine does the task have to do with the trumps or getter no it does not do you get to keep the patriot patent that TPUSA provides for us since you're spending over five figures to join their event um so they actually have two different uh packages as far as your booth goes they can give you they can make you a package or you could just use your own however that's a good question I imagine you can probably keep the uh personalized portion of it because I don't imagine they would want that you know but I would also imagine that they probably keep their actual like tables and stuff like that the the more reusable generic stuff but that's a good question so basically so the package we're looking at for TPUSA is not the high I mean a lot of it sold out to be honest it's not the highest package but it's not the lowest and we're if we do do it if it does cook because again the big issue is having the app that's really cutting it close and of course we want you all to test it um you know and get any bugs fixed so that's just cutting it super super close however um the package includes of course the booth and of course all the printed materials that they give to every attendee which this year they're expecting around 15,000 people or so so far um we're still what um uh so we're still about five five weeks away give or take and um right now they have about 15,000 expected at the event and also a two-minute video on stage that would be an add-on to the actual package that includes everything else uh so that's pretty cool i think the video have ban and start out i think that would get everybody's attention but again that very much depends on the app either way we do have a press pass to TPUSA so we will still be there for that so that that would be pretty cool either way but again the we just don't want to pay for that and commit for that or commit to that if our app is not a hundred percent flowing smoothly so that's kind of that's kind of where we're at as far as that goes i thought he was snoring but i just turned around he's actually up so i don't know sounded like a snore what are you doing pretty sure my dog has um cancer actually so i have him in ketosis now all right let's see i think j-rock is typing so wait for that i know who was it somebody was asking that we launch christmas but i'd like it to go uh much before that so that again with us expecting things to come up by definition uh we definitely would like it to have it before then so that we can work out any bugs and make sure everybody is taken care of everything's moving smoothly so that's why we'd like to go live much before christmas i'd like to have it um going a hundred percent smoothly by christmas that would be nice that'd be a nice christmas gift but yeah as far as um actually launching christmas unless something catastrophic comes up that's not the case right now as far as the task goes um and i'm not i know it's fjb world i'm not saying something catastrophic won't happen but i think and hope that is very unlikely oh what was j-rock typing you could always just come up on voice but you'll have to type to me because i turn off my notifications sounds because otherwise they go crazy with uh telegram and discord going off and then i have i have my whatsapp usually use that with the devs and i have signal to use that with the big bosses um all my text communication apps i guess on the desktop when would we start showing up with our tent at trump rallies i know i was trying to find a actually i have not this week i was trying to find a uh schedule for that is there a schedule yet but there was not and i've i've looked at this for probably honestly probably a year and jay says they don't schedule far out for security reasons yeah but before he would have like the next few weeks i know that was the case when i know when the old team what when i was doing just the social media stuff i remember specifically um getting those schedules because i had to do that then too yeah that's exactly what it used to be the couple of weeks but i haven't even found those recently wouldn't boris know yes boris absolutely knows can you do at least one of it in florida this year or next year so the florida peeps can visit the booth yeah we can do that i think there's there's a lot of people in florida here oh my gosh i did not realize mj was in california at least that's a short drive you guys probably have cooler weather they're finally still hot as heck here oh i get it eight of five my parents um used to be in oakland hills i don't know if that's any close to that okay well i think that's everything uh i will keep you guys updated um again we hope to get those political donations a final decision kind of on that hopefully in this coming week uh again just gotta be really careful with that um but especially especially if we have yeah i think that should be fine especially if you yeah i think i'm thinking out loud now um so that should be coming this week this phase that the dev team is working on should be completed monday or tuesday again uh the new phase starts right away they very much understand on how big of a time crunch we're on and then our main dev of course that is wrapping everything um for us to send to third party um yeah i think that's that's very exciting it just seems so surreal um and then we'll i'm sure i'm sure it'll be on a voice chat um that we probably i don't know i don't know how we'll do it but it'll be it will be awesome you know best guess when we can no task um honestly it depends so right now we're dependent on our main dev um once he's polished it to send to the third party and they said they can get everything completed within a day but to be safe they're telling us 10 days and i think they just we we've been in with the they've grown they've grown a ton with us and we've grown a ton with them um so we have a lot of history and i think they definitely understand how timelines have worked um for us and for them so i believe that's why they told us you know they'd like the 10 days just to be sure um we do have a very very uh complicated project task uh so but again i don't expect it to take 10 days they don't expect it to take 10 days but again you never know you know if i say that it's going to take 12 so really largely depends on that but uh yeah i will keep you updated again everybody knows how much of a time crunch we are on the devs are aware they see your messages uh in the chats and i've apologized sometimes but lately everybody's been pretty calm um i don't think i've needed to apologize to the devs anytime recently and i sent velo the uh screenshots of you guys missing him i think you replied saying aww so yeah i think that's that please get your coins off xt we will not be able to help you if xt or once xt decides you've had enough time and they take those there's nothing we can do for you so please make sure of that also wire if you ever purchased coins but never received the coins then they still have your funds you have till december 3rd for xt i would get that asap i would not definitely not wait till december 3rd i would not wait till the end of the month but if you need anything in the meantime please let me know um yeah i think it's finally finally like uh it's finally getting to the calm um part of everything so that's awesome just making sure making sure we don't fuck it up now but yeah i think that's all i'll get the recording going and post it actually before i leave the house and let me know if you guys need anything else in the meantime i hope you all have a good weekend um i'm sure i'll be on here i think you guys know my weekend schedule by now with my mornings at church and most of sunday's there so uh but yeah that's that's everything i will talk to you guys soon
