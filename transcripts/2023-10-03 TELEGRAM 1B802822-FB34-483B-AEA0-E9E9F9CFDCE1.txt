[Speaker 1]
Hello, happy Tuesday. Sorry about the barking. We have a dog chewing her bone in here because the rest already ate their bones and she's going a little slower because she just had some teeth pulled out.

So I apologize for any of the chewing sound effects. It's not me. All right, I hope you guys had a wonderful weekend.

I definitely did. It was a great weekend in FJB world. My meeting Monday did not go as well as we had hoped.

It was an excellent meeting. The quote is just much higher than we can afford right now. So we'll be waiting on that review we hope to do in the future once we grow the community and can get something like that just added basically under our belt.

So we have moved on and we will be starting the first review this evening. So super, super excited about that. The quote for this one is up to 18 days for this review is up to 18 days.

They give us a rough estimate obviously because with testing and you just really never as we've seen never know how it's going to work out everything. I mean I feel like it's almost like having a house inspection. You want everything to work as intended but obviously you hope they find some things that you can fix.

So we have that review. The 18 days does include any modifications they will need to do. So if they do find something isn't working as intended that time estimate of 18 days did include those modifications but again that is an estimate obviously if they find you know while they're reviewing some functions don't work as intended or anything like that we're not going to stop at 18 days and call it a day if there's more work that needs to be done.

So I'm just trying to keep expectations realistic there. Again we definitely hope that you know everything is just wonderful and perfect but I imagine you know if they find some things then we need them to just fine comb go through everything just make sure everything's great. What with two reviews so the team wants at least the two reviews we have so we have one company and one in more independent they're actually both companies but just size-wise.

So we have a larger company and a smaller company. With the way that the reviews work we want that first review we can't have both reviews go at the same time rather we can but it's really just a waste of our time and a waste of the reviewers time. So we'll have that first the larger company do their review first once they go ahead and take care of that we'll have our second review which that one should we were quoted one to three days because they that smaller company is working just on us full-time.

They quoted us three days so we'll do that the first review with the larger company second review with a smaller one and then we'll get the modifications worked on. So that's the time frame we have right now they are beginning tonight. I will keep you updated on how everything goes throughout the process but again as you all know and especially this being we're literally just having them review everything the devs have worked on up to this point so I'll keep you updated on how everything goes.

I am just crossing my fingers and praying that you know their time estimate is accurate but if it's not I'm not exactly going to be mad because I know this is a very critical part. I'd hate to see all the work that has been done all the money that's been spent all this time and then something small or trivial be missed. So very very exciting and like finally we're here.

As far as the app the app we've had some amazing functions additions integrations added on and I'm so excited. My only thing is are we going to roll these out one by one or just throw them all at you? I feel like at this point we've all waited for so long we just like need it just all at once but I will keep you updated on how that goes.

Let me see questions. Our app the the apple app store is a fairly simple fix so it's just we have a easy fix I will let you know as soon as that's updated. Marie from apple app store has been very helpful.

Boris is all up to date on that as of this morning. I do have some questions okay. Okay I'll make sure to read these because this person says they're not going to make the next voice chat but have a couple of points that I hope you can speak to.

What does the next week look like? What is happening with the review? What are the devs doing?

Okay so I think I answered that the next week so we are starting tonight. Review number one will begin tonight. Again after that review is completed the second review will happen and then any modifications that need to be taken care of.

What are the devs doing? So we have devs working on the app and we have devs starting on the review tonight. How's the app work coming along?

Are I think that's a typo. Are the devs working on that making progress? What has caused the app to be removed from the app store?

Okay I think I just reviewed those awesome. How's the merch? We are waiting on different files.

We should be receiving those today in an hour I suppose. So as soon as those begin we've just needed to request different files. We also have a few graphic designers working on some new designs and also still on the in-person designs like banners and stuff like that.

So that's nice. We added the second graphic designer this morning. So super excited about that.

Hoping that helps move things along a little bit quicker. Has the marketing campaign been mapped out and plotted? Yes we are working with somebody to help out with that.

Is it likely that the task will be revealed in October? I think that's the last question. So that's going to heavily depend on how the review goes.

We will keep you updated on that. Again we were hoping that the Monday meeting was the much larger company that we were hoping to do one of the reviews but that was again much out of our price range for right now. Still something we'd love to do in the future but the first review will begin tonight and we are feeling very very confident about this team and of course the second one too.

So feeling great about that again. The review and or the task and what will be revealed in October relies heavily on that. It's just critical we get this part done correctly.

We can either go without it or we can go by just getting one review or you know the review that cost just you know the review that takes just a few days. But we'd rather be safe than sorry just to make sure that we did everything we can do on our part with the resources we have to make sure we have the highest level of success before growing the community. So that's that.

Why was my comment deleted? What was a serious question? I don't know I missed.

What was your comment? Let me look a second to look that up. What was your serious question?

Guys there it's enough of badmouthing Finn. Finn was actually I know there's a lot of behind the scenes stuff you all don't see but just like any business Finn was actually wonderful for us and he did a lot for us. Very very helpful and we used a ton of his resources.

The marketing again this time around we are not doing digital airstrikes or the like. We are growing slow and steady and then of course as you know Bannon how many followers does Bannon have? Once we have our stuff together from sorry I have DMs coming in from everywhere.

So yeah War Room alone we should be great but I think yeah I think it'll be great again. I can't wait to finally share everything with you all. It's nobody wants that more than I do.

We just can't we don't want to wait all this time to you know miss a few little details. Are we going to use FJBCoin as well as PatriotPay? Guys yes FJBCoin is still FJBCoin.

The app is PatriotPay so I'm sorry if I haven't made that clear. The app is PatriotPay. FJBCoin is still FJBCoin.

I hope that is clear. In order to fork FJBCoin we would have to or change the name of Let's Go Brandon or FJBCoin. We would need a fork and a fork right now having to pay $60-$65,000 for each exchange.

Something that's definitely not in our budget. So just like the review from the Very Large Company we were you know quoted an insane amount that we just cannot afford right now. It just wouldn't make sense with the funds we have available to us right now.

Once we do get there that's something we're definitely wanting to do of course. So I hope that answers that. Thanks it wasn't meant to be.

Honest question about how this marketing plan will compare to what has been done in the past. Well I don't to be completely honest with you I don't think much has been done in the past and that is definitely not Finn's fault because Finn paid out of his own pocket after not being paid what he was promised by the old team, the old crew for many many months. I believe he got paid for one month that he was supposed to if that and then he paid much more than that out of his own pocket to get some marketing completed.

However, I don't think that'll be hard to do considering the founding team didn't do much of marketing past a Poocoin ad, I think some Instagram ads. So I think we're definitely moving in the right direction and I think the task alone with the app changes. You all will agree once you see that.

Discord I don't think I have any DMs there except for yeah buddy. Anything else? In a strange way it feels like a Friday to me I don't know why.

How has I'm assuming the smart wallet changes come along? I will let you know as soon as those darn transactions are fixed. That is proving to be very challenging.

Can you elaborate on the added features of the app? I can on some of them so that I think I've kind of already shared. So our app will be a lot more user-friendly as far as account creation and logging in and that includes everything with VESS.

They have been spectacular and they're they are amazing at what they do and of course security is their number one priority. They also have like VESS encryption coming out. They also have VESS email.

A lot of really cool things. Feel free to check out their website but we are working with them to simplify that entire process and it's going to be so much better. Outside of that actually to answer the rest of your question Ed.

Outside of that it'll be other than functions I've already spoken to. It'll be functions that definitely help us and integrations that definitely will help get our name out there. Just integrating with more crypto sites.

Crypto platforms. What is the update with VESS? Will it still be integrated after the task is revealed?

Will there be tutorials for Moomers aka Steve's audience to assist if VESS will still be part of the app? Yes, VESS will still be part of the app. However, it is changing.

It'll be much much easier than what you see now. You'll still have the option. So I know like my grandma who's paranoid of everything.

If she wanted to get on the app she still has the option after she creates her account using again a much more user-friendly process that we are switching to. She can still choose to follow all the steps that you can do now with VESS as far as adding a friend and adding a device or browser. But you don't have to.

You'll be able there won't be you know all these layers you have to do where basically I felt like I was hiding. It's like almost like when you hide something from yourself and then you just forget where you put it. Sometimes how I felt about VESS.

So we are doing away with that. Again it will still be very secure. You will still need your seed phrase but if you get a new phone or you know lose the brow lots of people.

It's just you're on a different device. You don't remember which you know maybe on your laptop you have or desktop you have different browsers and then you forget which one you originally. I think that's happened to many people which one you originally created your account on.

You won't have to deal with any of that in the future but again you'll still be able to add the layers of extra security if you want as far as the adding a friend. We may actually also that'll be really cool. This is something we're still discussing.

It's only not high on the priority list because it's not exactly time for us. We're not like at that point yet. However we are for the people that choose to add the add a friend option.

We are trying to work out a way where you can add FJB as a friend. Now for your security we don't want that to be like our FJB email or you know any new email we create but we are thinking more of a peer to peer community. So say a group of you know 20-30 people would have to be trusted members of the community.

It's a lot more complicated. We're not again we haven't decided but these are just ideas floating around. So on top of it being trusted people I mean you'd have to have several people give you their part of the puzzle basically for you to then be able to sign in if you forget your info or lose your info.

So there's a few options there but we will think of something as far as that goes too. That way I know adding the FJB email would kind of be easier to just have one but we don't want that liability. If we find a way to make that work that would be ideal but I'll keep you updated.

A lot of super cool super cool stuff along with the so the integrations. Gosh now I'm going probably saying more than I should but as far as the integrations go so you know how you go on different websites on crypto sites and you can connect your wallet and there's just a list of wallets. Of course you have MetaMask and TrustWallet but then you have a ton of other wallets that you can connect to.

So we are hoping to add PatriotPay under that so that would be really cool. Also as far as social media um with contests linking on your wallet and having that integration to social media and running contests that way where say you can share a post or comment on a post or you know do XYZ tasks to earn a certain amount of either points or FJB coins. We haven't decided on some details there we haven't quite decided on but something like that which I think will be really cool because it'll be it'll give people and the diehard fans something fun to do but also help spread the word out so I think that'll be pretty cool too.

I feel like you guys are quiet in here tonight. I think I'm the only one talking. No Moku.

We do have a few things as far as partners waiting on our task to be live too. There's a few things that need our task from the techy I guess from the techy aspect of our task to be full-on live before some other steps can be completed with some partners so that'll be really cool too. What's my favorite season?

I'm in Phoenix we don't have seasons. I'm born and raised here although right now it's pretty amazing the weather weather is finally cooler now walking the dogs they're five six seven eight nine miles in the mornings and it's kind of chilly I think I'm gonna have to wear a hoodie again. Yeah hotter hotter I do love the summers absolutely laying out gonna lay out install the deminder app get your hour of vitamin d every day.

What did you miss? Review will be beginning tonight. I think that's the most important one.

The rest you can hear maybe through the grapevine. What else anything else? Uh no as far what are we talking about uh are we talking about the vest uh so added features to the app we are changing the login and account creation process to make that much more simple much more boomer friendly um all you need will be your seed phrase.

We're also thinking about adding FJB as a friend or FJB email but so far we haven't found a way to do that and still keep the same level of security so so far it's either that or picking a random group of trusted folks in the community maybe 10 20-30 people and having those people you know you you need a part of the puzzle from each one to send you what you need if you forget your info you'll still have all the best options so you can you know add the browser add a friend you can that all those options will still be there but that's after you've already created your account or logged in that you can choose to go through that you don't have to wow there isn't 20 trustworthy people here oh uh there is a potential that the review starting tonight might only take a few days um so here let me go into and that was a question anybody listening to this later so our review the so the 15 to 18 days um does include the optimization right um so that it does include and that's anywhere let's do some math here uh 12 okay so 12 to 15 days um will actually be the review that's the estimate again keep in mind to keep um your expectations pretty realistic again that's just an estimate right because they have seen we've sent over of course everything with every detail um but you guys know how testing goes uh so the estimate they're giving us right now is that the review itself would take anywhere from 12 to 15 days um the 15 to 18 days so you know the other three to give or take six days uh would be the same team fixing any of the issues they find so we'll be doing the 12 to 15 day review again just an estimate may take less may take more then we'll have our second review which we got an estimate it'll be one to three days and then we'll have this first company again complete any modifications that need to happen so let's pull up calendar seven days would put us about 14 13 12 so 12 days would put us at sunday october 15th that's the 12 15 days would put us at october 18th which is right now the highest estimate they're giving us for the actual review then we'd have the one to three days say say three days that takes us to the 21st and then we go back to another six ish days to complete the modifications we're talking october 27th but again you all know how testing goes they are beginning tonight i will keep you updated on everything there so christmas it better be before christmas because i want to sell those dang gift cards plus i want like a nice gift maybe i can ask boris not in a weird way but just hey i feel like i should get a gift for christmas did third party ever start third party will start after review is completed they need everything complete before they start they are waiting on us though third party at this point is waiting on us to begin that's funny i just saw that thought only a mother could love us hey i love us well i think that's everything i am very excited for this team to start tonight i will keep you all updated on any updates i get from them vlog them every few days for an update and see how that goes oh i do gonna share some of the if i can pull them up some of the merch there's a few of them that i really am gonna order for myself so here's some of the designs for merch sam says he's trustworthy so sticking with freedom jobs business coin indefinitely and a patriot pay is the name of the app um for the time being until we can fork so we gotta keep the freedom jobs business until we can fork and then we can do away with that but um i mean if you think about it patriot pay once we get that changed in the app store with the app logo i think that's what everybody sees first and then once we can afford that fork we'll be switching to that and we can hopefully move to some variation of maybe something patriot related stay stay in that realm it's pretty cool can we see f kevin mccarvey yeah what the heck what's next for that oh boy drum for speaker can you guys uh that didn't you can't really see it without working on here this one you can see better cool uh yeah so i am excited for how this first review will go um they have a ton to go through so i'm hoping that the timeline doesn't change too much or if it changes that it's a little bit less time but i will keep you all updated please move your coins off xt if you have not already or if you know anybody that does have fjd even if you don't think they have it next to you they might have bought some on there please let them know to move their coins off there make sure you do that sooner than later if you guys need anything else please email dm or tag me um i think that's all really hoping those failed transactions are fixed this week but i will keep you updated um that way a few of you who need to get your coins off there can um i need to send a last payment tonight i'm waiting on a wallet address confirmation um interesting yeah i wonder who's gonna be hopefully it's not uh kevin mccarthy that's back i imagine if he's just back in there all right well i will write some notes and post the recording um but you guys let me know if there's anything else you need i'll keep you updated um i think this is gonna be a very productive month again you all have a great night
