[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Well, happy Tuesday. I don't have anything new to share today, but I wanted to get on anyway in case anybody had any questions for me to answer right now.

We have a lot of changes coming again. I'm so sorry. But I think it's for the better.

We told you all months ago, back in August, I believe, which has been four, five, six, wow, six months already, that will get there, but it's going to take time. So sticking to that, yeah, let me know if you have any questions. And I'll get those answered.

Other than that, I don't have any updates from the last time we spoke, last Friday. Just kind of still waiting for some very important changes to get the details completely finalized and in writing before we share that. Let's see.

You guys do need to chill on the whole Discord Telegram thing. I know it started in, you know, all good fun, but I think it's kind of gone a little too far. So let's remember we're all on the same team and step away from that.

You know, I know emotions are high, but from the personal attacks and name calling and all that, and I'm no way shape or form saying this just to Telegram people. I just know that everybody listens to these voices. So I'm just repeating kind of what we talked about on Friday, but please, please, please keep that down.

We don't, I don't want to go back to banning everybody because if we did that, I think most everybody would be banned right now, understandably so with the high emotions and, you know, it's like a family. We all have bad days. We all have, you know, we all have lives, right?

We all have other factors going on in our lives and nobody's perfect. So I know I sure am not. So that's the reason behind not banning people.

Just, you know, just let each other be. Again, we haven't really banned many people in the last several weeks, maybe even months, realizing that emotions are high and giving everybody that grace. So just please help me out and just, you know, try to tone that down a bit for the best interest of the coin and for the best interest of everybody.

Yeah, that's all we need to discuss about that, I think. Sun Devil, how are you getting paid for your work, FJB or USD? I have not been paid for my work.

I actually need to get still reimbursed for some of my funds that I put in, but yes, believe it or not. Um, let's see. I don't think I have any questions in DMs. A few people wanting to buy from the marketing wallet. I think I've replied to all of you. So just waiting on replies back. Mm hmm.

What else? Apparently, Donnie had a birthday. I did not know that.

Happy birthday to Donnie. Donnie didn't know some like insult either. So now I don't feel bad for having to Google something.

Yeah, I do not have any questions in the DMs. Sometimes I go to my archived chats, but I don't think I have anything there either. Hi, Sarah, can you speak to the app and when it will be launch ready? I wish I had a magic time for you.

I will let you know as soon as we get everything finalized. Yeah. Sooner than later, we are getting a lot closer.

The latest from Transac, I'm not sure if you mean the off ramp or the tax, but the off ramp, we are still waiting. They told us they'd update us. It's looking like it'll be delayed, which is understandable.

We kind of really anticipated that from the get go. It's not just FJB that runs behind. I think most, especially in the crypto world, do a lot of unexpected issues they're running into, especially with getting licensed in the U.S. Again, so very understandable because they are based in India, I believe. As far as the taxes, for the time being, tax will stay on for Transac. We do have some changes coming to that soon, though. How long till love forward with devs?

Maybe how long till move forward with devs? I'm not sure. The recruitment of devs, when will that be?

That's happening along with the final changes being approved and planned. Does that make sense? Sorry, might not make sense.

Taxes, collections from ChangeNow and Transac still hasn't changed from before. Transac paid us out a little bit over 400 bucks from now on. They said once it hits 500, they send that over.

And then ChangeNow, actually, the last we got from them is we were waiting on one of their representatives to check on our balance from there. Jan, be nice. See, when Weg was in here being rude to everybody and disturbing Telegram's peace, I just banned him, you know, even though he thought it was funny.

It wasn't funny to me because, you know, it's like if you don't want to, if you don't like the Telegram people, just stay out of Telegram. So same thing goes to Telegram. If you don't like the Discord people, just please stay out of there.

You know, it's kind of a, it's kind of good that we have like little clicks forming. That just means we have that large of a community, which is a good thing. New white paper release date.

We don't have a release date. We are working on something else before that, and I am hoping we can release that as soon as possible. Again, I did not want to share anything without having it in writing and signed after it's in writing.

Signed and approved and dated with the T's crossed, the I's dotted. This week, I hope so. If it were up to me, it would be today.

But like I said, lots of details to work out, lots and lots of changes. I feel awful even saying that because I feel like we've dealt with many, many changes and the changes keep happening. But I think it's definitely for the better.

I think it'll make a lot of sense and ultimately it is in the best interest of the coin and the holders. Update on March sales. We actually had, I believe, two sales in the past seven days, so that's pretty awesome because we haven't had March sales for, I believe, weeks.

Somebody bought a few shirts and I think a hat, and then somebody else purchased a few candles. Gift cards. We are waiting for a password, one password that we did not receive from before, so we're just trying to work that out and get that all reset.

Otherwise, gift cards have been completed. It's just a tiny, tiny little detail that would make gift cards run even smoother and easier for new users. They are fully functional right now, but we're just trying to get it kind of optimized and use all the features that were added to those gift cards.

We want to use the really, really neat feature and roll it out at once. I think it'd be really cool if we just have a link on the website where, you know, War Room viewers can purchase a shirt and they get the shirt with a free gift card. I think that'd be really awesome and it takes them, you know, once they scan it, it takes them automatically to download the app.

Easy peasy. How long till FJB at a dollar? Forward that one to legal.

Where's Diesel? Oh, the shirts and hat was you? That's awesome.

Thank you. When will Bannon be promoting FJB daily? Will he do a longer segment on FJB?

That is in the plan for him to do a longer segment once we have our shit together. Jan. See, you guys talk about Discord fudding, but you guys do it in here too.

I don't say anything. I watch it all day. I understand emotions are high.

War Room launch before Transac off-ramp? I don't think it's dependent on the off-ramp any longer, so I think it's independent of that. Maybe before, maybe after.

I know at one point that was a main concern. No longer is. When staking?

With the new changes that should be taking place, I believe staking will be built in, but I will update you again. There's still some details being worked out, so I don't want to promise anything or you know, share anything that might not happen. What's the next steps for marketing this to the masses?

We are working on a lot of changes. Once those changes take place, we will go ahead and continue to that step, marketing to the masses. But we are much, much, much closer, and as you see, Bannon, Boris fully on board and definitely ready.

So we're hoping to get them to continue doing that before they're busy with the 2024 campaign again. I think it's the perfect time. Update on gender affirming care.

Gosh, people. Stop it. Stop.

A few weeks ago, there was some screen chatter about a name change. Absolutely. What's the latest?

Yes. As far as doing some changes, you know, Freedom Jobs Business is amazing. We love that.

The whole FJB, um, you know, everybody knows what that means, and we are having trouble with vendors approving us for anything. Even people like Mike Lindell, uh, my store. Super conservative rallies, super conservative, uh, events, concerts.

Nobody wants that liability. I imagine, even though nobody has said it, we always get a very kind message back, a denial letter, if you will. Um, so we just want to let go of that.

So I will update you as soon as the changes are finalized, but we just kind of want to move away from that FJB or fjbcoin.org or, um, anything where, again, we, you know, we did change it to Freedom Jobs Business, but again, everybody kind of knows what FJB is now, right? Update on rally stall applications. Um, not sure.

I'm assuming just any, we've literally been denied for every single application we've applied for, and we've had some dang good applications. I've made the diagrams they've asked for, everything. Um, so yes, we've not been approved for one.

Pretty soon, I'm just gonna put a table in a tent out on like a dirt road right by me. Uh, Sun Devil, do you forgive us for how we treated you on the Monday from hell? Yes, no hard feelings.

I'm a forgiver. Kindling Violet says, you mean you. Uh, hey, I get it.

I would probably feel the same if I didn't have all the facts either, but please understand, uh, there's a reason behind all that. So I forgive, uh, everybody. I love you guys.

Does not mean fork, new coin, FJB baked into contract. I will update you as soon as I can. How about PubSquare coin?

I don't know if, uh, I don't know if that would be allowed, but we are, uh, we are working our way through that website. Surprised you guys haven't noticed. So don't show FJB coin.org.

Uh, feel free to, we haven't, like I said, we don't have any finalized plans yet. Uh, we just understand, you know, our, even our main email admin at FJB coin.org or Sarah at FJB coin.org, you know, so all these applications I'm putting in, they're seeing this email, right? Um, even our merch, et cetera, et cetera.

I know we've all discussed that before. Uh, so we just want to move more towards pro America and pro what we are versus F X, Y, Z, uh, just to be very smart and strategic with our marketing and getting the word out there. And I understand, uh, some people have said, Oh, you know, you're bowing down to them, et cetera, et cetera.

Um, that's definitely not the case. We just have to be strategic. If even Mike Lindell is saying, no, you can't be on my store.

Um, then, you know, we, we gotta start somewhere and, uh, we can still be pro everything we are and FJB. Hopefully, I don't know if that guy's going to be out of office soon, but you know, sooner than later, right? You said something in the last call about things in writing being completely within the week.

Has there been any advancement on this? Uh, yes, there has been, uh, quite a bit of an advancement, but, uh, still not completed. B and B are still busy.

We've done a lot. We've made a lot of progress, but we can only go as, uh, quickly as they can. What's the best way to drop more than 1500?

I'm assuming dollars on FJB. If all I have is the app wallet. Ooh.

Um, I mean, you can always Venmo somebody who has or cash app or something or Zelda. And if they're willing to, if they have like, uh, you know, Bitcoin or something else, they can go ahead and send you use change now.io or purchase straight from the marketing wallet, uh, through the same method, if that makes sense. So you'll be paying somebody Fiat, uh, through Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, et cetera.

And they'll be sending you Bitcoin or another coin they have in their wallet. Uh, they can either send you that and you swap it into FJB or they can send you it through change now.io. Uh, and it will get to you in FJB. That's what I can think of.

I'm sure people have other, uh, ideas. Also make sure if you are using the app that your transact isn't your bank doesn't, uh, charge you a international fee. I know bank of America charges $40 on some of their accounts, which would suck because it happens with every purchase you make super annoying.

You're welcome. I made a margarita, but it's like a coconut something one. And I was not in the mood for coconut, but too late should have made a spicy one.

Oh, Bella's here. What else are social media is looking amazing. Hmm.

What are you expecting to have legals contract finalized? Um, I'd be lying if I gave you a time right now. I am of course hoping for as soon as possible, but you all see.

So I will keep you updated as soon as I do though. Even if it's not a Tuesday, Friday, we'll have a, an emergency urgent, uh, voice quarter one. Uh, yeah.

Oh yeah. Definitely quarter one for sure. I would be very, very disappointed if it were not, or at least to have it, uh, announced by then if not done.

Absolutely. Absolutely. No update from trans.

Shannon said on war room that he wants to build this rabbit rapidly. Correct. Yes, absolutely.

Some, um, I think really, really big changes. And I think, uh, current holders will be very happy with and, uh, future holders too. I think it'll be in the best interest of the coin, um, for many, many reasons.

Do it, just do it. A month ago, you said you were looking for some more influencers. Yes, absolutely.

Uh, we would like to do it a lot differently than we have in the past. Um, with that, I've not had any say with the influencers and how we did that in the past. Um, as you see, there wasn't much movement, I don't think, or results from those.

Uh, so of course we'd like to do it differently. Do you have a list you will use and are looking for more? Uh, this is in regards to influencers or the ones you had are no longer around.

Um, no, the ones we had, it was just, you know, we had the deal with them. Nobody, nobody dropped out. Nobody said they were no longer interested.

Um, nobody deleted their post as posts as far as I know, just changing, um, definitely adding influencers and then changing the way, uh, we want them to, uh, share FJB or even our merchandise. By the way, did war room. Let's see.

I haven't checked. I know war room was supposed to drop their merch. Have they done that yet?

Let's see. Oh, I see some, but I don't think this is official. Let's see.

Let's just go to their website. Okay. I don't see it anywhere.

So maybe it's not out yet. I don't see anything here. I'm missing it somewhere, but it's a pretty easy to navigate site.

In your opinion, who, what other crypto will this coin rival? Oh, that's, I think that's very hard to predict. I'm not sure.

Let's, let's take all your opinions on that. Okay. I don't know of any other, um, conservative crypto that's still alive.

Who was our LGB coin? Was that our biggest competition really? Is the app still going to be central to moving forward?

Uh, I think so for the most part. Yes. And is the app still going to rival Coinbase?

I believe so. Uh, we'd like to get as many new coins on there as we possibly can. And, um, I think it's again, I know, uh, V E E S or VESS was pretty difficult for us in the beginning, but it really is so much easier now.

I really do believe even somebody like my mom or grandma would be able to do it. Pretty simple app, easy peasy as long as it's working or when it is working. So that's just what we're getting down.

It's a beautiful app. Imagine what happens if we add, uh, donations, charities on there. If we add, uh, donations to political candidates on there, I think it, uh, really has lots and lots of potential.

By the way, take down the CP is still not on Spotify. It's so weird that they just one day it disappeared. Song unavailable.

Let's put on some other music, something else. It's a little quiet. It's a little quiet when my zoo isn't in here.

They're like, uh, dog-proofed my whole house so they can't just follow me. Put baby gates everywhere. You guys with kids probably know a lot about that.

So much more relaxing now. So everything in the pipeline and within reach will be positive for all current and future holders. Yes, absolutely.

Um, all the changes we have in the works right now. Um, I believe you all would, will be very happy with ultimately. I'm sure somebody will complain, but that's what you guys do.

Um, assuming you mean that these things in place will result in an increase in price. Um, I can not say that I do mean that these things in place will result in the growth of FJB. That is, um, definitely the intention.

How long till you think the events will take place for staking white paper? Wait, sorry. I lost my place with that gift.

New name, Bannon, war room segments. Um, by quarter one, I think. Um, who was it?

MP put it very nicely. I think definitely by quarter one we could at least have everything finalized to share with you all. Nice to have bellow back.

I want to go on a cruise though. Um, when you say growth, do you mean advertising through war room, which will inform more people about the coin, which would result in more holders. You guys are trying to get me in trouble.

Oh my gosh. Stop trying to get me in trouble. I'll put diesel in here to answer you.

She can't, she has to check the legal. Has there been any talk about the previous coin burn that was supposed to start? Um, no, but I I think you'll be happy with the changes coming.

Yeah, I know, but I understand the whole BNB CCP thing, but I think that's more than meets the eye from what I've heard from the crypto experts that we have. You are welcome. Lots of new names.

Did you all just get alts? Why are you trying to confuse me? I think we should have everybody just come in with their original accounts.

So we all know who you are and we can all just be family. Even if you've acted crazy before, it's okay. You got to get to know the real us, you know, we accept you.

As long as you don't have blue hair. Awesome. Nice to have you on telegram, Rob.

As long as it's not Weg. I think Weg's the only, uh, discorder not allowed on telegram. I think the rest of the other ones just know to leave the telegrammers alone.

Will we hear from Boris? I'm assuming like a community discord call. I'm not sure if that's what you mean.

Um, I think BNB have made their presence clear through the, uh, war room mentions, but we can definitely, uh, still try. Yep. Like the one that was rescheduled.

Yes. Yeah. We were rescheduled a few times back in, I want to say December, January.

Win CPAC. Hmm. Let me know if you have any more questions.

I'm just answering DMs in the meantime. Thank you. MP, uh, Alex, is there a chance we could have bigger platform, for example, Binance?

Um, maybe when we have the funds for it, but we certainly don't have, uh, hundreds of thousands of dollars to, uh, get listed there. And I think we have, we have our reach with Bannon. I don't think that'll be a problem at all, but Hey, never say never as far as Binance goes.

Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
All right. That looks like all the questions. Uh, let me know as always, if you have any other questions, um, you can tag me or don't even tag me.

I'm still lurking. I know I don't, uh, say much, but as you see, I pop in to answer things I need to, um, or DM me. Uh, but you all have a great night.

Thank you as always for joining. I'll go ahead and, uh, put up the recording. Uh, yes, EZFJB will do.

I saw you right there on the top. Um, yeah, I will do another voice on Friday. Um, I can't promise that I'll have any updates, but always here for Q and A.

You all have a wonderful night. I will talk to you soon.
