[Speaker 1]
My discord is My phone has to charge because I've been on it all day and forgot to Charge it. So hopefully the sound is okay there Awesome well As many of you suspected we are going to start testing today I've been testing the app for a few days now with the Polygon network updates and then of course all the other updates we've had So we'll have you all test it now we will start with you Just playing around with it testing whatever you want to test and then either later tonight or tomorrow I'll go ahead and give you a list of specific things to test if you're all up to it make sure you do go into the channels both on discord and Telegram to report those Bugs, there's a little template on there. Just fill as much as you can Of it. We know you're not all Nolan or Farkas so So, you know the best best you can whatever information you have leave the rest and That way we get the best to start working on those See I don't have any questions in my DMs and the emails have been quiet Hopefully you've all moved your funds off Out of your best wallets and hopefully everybody else, you know has So what you will do Is you will actually make all you'll all have to make new accounts you can use your current Email the same email used for the Vess account Do bear with us the app is Working a little bit slower the devs. That is a known issue the dev Particularly one dev is actually working on that So, yeah, you should all be good to start testing via the link on Your web browser or your phone app.

Let's see Yep Pretty quiet in here. So I imagine everybody's making their account Oops First time I'm actually logging in from the app Everybody's already created their account. Oh nice.

It's already working a lot quicker. Nice Matt the link is gonna be the same Way you access your app so if you access it through the link on That you're downloaded or this link which is the web Awesome nobody's had trouble that easy. I told you it's so easy.

My grandma can do it literally Not just saying that like others have but I think I don't know Ed, would your mother-in-law would she get that? I think so I don't think it gets I feel like signing up for an email address is probably more difficult than that So, yeah, you don't need to use that link you can use the app that's downloaded on your device Whether that's your iPad or and you're gonna use it doesn't need to be the same email that you had to use previously just FYI Because you are creating a new account So can be any email you choose it should be very quick and painless So For now you won't be able to buy As far as testing goes, of course, you can transfer in You can transfer out you can swap in and out you can transfer P P Y in And then also with the stable coins on there with the USD T USD C you We're not on aetherium anymore So you're not gonna have the crazy high gas prices and all the surprises some of you ran into when you accidentally did that Yes, I see from Sorry, where'd I see that pop-up JB says I don't see any seed phrase anywhere. Yes You will not see a seed phrase right now and it won't be a seed phrase.

It'll actually be a Private key that you could put into metamask or any others where you can put a private key We are working on that right now. You will not see that Magic doesn't have that as an automatic option. I Logged in zero balance.

Yes, you all should have a zero balance as These are new accounts So Again as far as testing goes you can play around with it do whatever you'd like test it However, you like you're not going to be able to buy anything You can swap in out Trade Do I need a magic account The account you just created through the app is the only account you need. I Know it's hard to believe Especially, you know from what we're coming from Previously Let me log in with my old email and sent me a passcode but I didn't have sign up for me No, that is your sign up. That's literally that simple So if you entered your email address that sent you a passcode you entered that in That is you signing up.

It's that easy So you can either enter or use the same email that you used for your previous account or You can use a new email Pretty cool so easy your grandma can do it just putting in my email address create an account. Yep As simple as that That's it. And now you can go on another device and you'll enter your email address and if you already have an account you're gonna get a code sent to your email and You'll have to enter that in again.

We will be adding Other options there also for security reasons But we'll update you guys as We build up to that That's that's as easy as that you put in your email and the accounts created and you can go on any device Now, of course with this you are gonna make sure you're gonna want to make sure that of course that your email is secure right So that's something I would double check on I don't know if there's anybody Still that uses like public computers or anything like that I would now be of course very careful with that as You already should be Can we send coins to this wallet right now? Yes. Yes, you can send Make sure though that the changes so now when you sent, of course, you can send Patriot pay That's gonna be pretty easy.

You all know how to do that But if you go ahead and send USDT or USDC make sure that's on the polygon network same with the wrapped Bitcoin The aetherium will be on the aetherium network Everything else will be on polygon. So just make sure When you are transferring in that you're not transfer transferring in USDT or you SDC that's on aetherium if you do have that I know a few of you asked in the last voice chat. I'm pretty sure You know that you you wanted to use that to buy ppe why in the new app if you do have that what I would Do is get on change now and go ahead and Send that USDT on aetherium go ahead and send it through change now so type in change now in your browser change now dot IO and send Go get your Receiving address from the new app For whether whether it's USDT or USDC that you had make sure it's the polygon network When you enter it into change now Make sure the send, you know, you're gonna put USDC from USDC Aetherium to USDC polygon make sure that's very important if you need help, please DM me I don't want you to screw that up.

Although with change now using change now, you're usually pretty safe If you make a mistake like that, they'll usually go ahead and help you out But again You wanna just make sure that we're not on the aetherium network anymore as far as the stable coins go Same with that wrapped Bitcoin again aetherium will stay on aetherium But If you have any questions go ahead and DM me just so you don't lose your funds But yes, you can go ahead and transfer any you can transfer some PPI if you want to test with that Or anything else And you won't be able to test buys for now Um One quick issue for an old person like me Oh, I'm sure you're not old when I open the app the red signup login didn't highlight So I waited a minute thinking the connection was slow. Once I tapped on the square it highlighted one new person Let me see what you're talking about Let me sign out So I've been logging into this for Probably weeks now Okay, so I open the app and the red signup login didn't highlight.

Oh You mean before for jpizzle you mean that's before you entered an email address in Okay, I See I will Write that down forward that to myself. Thank you. Appreciate that Is there a smart wallet currently or does the toggle button not do anything though the toggle works just keep in mind that some of your Addresses will be the same until you send out a transaction from that wallet Um, but if you're having issues with that, please let me know If it's not if the toggle isn't working for you There isn't any info in the app like the receiving address or anything else No, there should be so you do it exactly how you did before And how you do in like, you know trust wallet or metamask so click on here let me go in click on receive And you should see Give me a second while I log in if you click on whatever coin it is and click receive you should get your address Do you guys like that email you get into? But yeah pretty email they send So, yeah when you go in there you'll go to receive and then that'll give you and then make sure Again, especially with the USDT USDC That we are on the polygon network now The same will happen for the wrapped Bitcoin. That's on polygon now, of course B&B is still on Binance and again Ethereum on Ethereum Okay, so you want to mess with that No, that's actually a pretty common question a lot of the time Yeah, that's probably one of the most frequently asked questions actually No, you cannot link trust wallet to this new wallet address you will be able to Link anything that takes a private key Like metamask Yes, if you have Matic so if you Go ahead and you just can't buy Matic right now because we want you guys to test this version first And then we'll go ahead and deploy the on-ramper but You can go ahead and send Matic to your wallet address and then go ahead and swap that What is Patriot pay wallet holding Can I put in my seed phrase to see my holdings Which seed phrase You won't be able to Import so if you have a trust wallet or your old wallet You won't be able to import it in this wallet to see your balance yet That is something magic is working on And they plan to have before the end of the year For now, you can only export your wallet from here as soon as we add that on Correct you will not be able to buy right now We'll have you guys text test this version and then we'll add the on-ramping version where you will get to test the new on-ramper App disclaimer, I'm assuming that was probably Typo Yeah, you won't be able to enter the old app seed phrase in right now And do we expect to add there no more timelines add Once we're done testing this and the bugs are all worked out in this version any main bugs We just want to make sure Once we have to once the devs have the bugs that we they know it's just it's easier for them to get those solved So we can't buy But if we send matic we do it through the trade button. Yeah, so you can send You can really send whatever If you have matic in a different wallet Say trust wallet You can go ahead and go to the app go to matic hit receive and send your matic to the address That's in the app and or PPI or well, probably don't do PPI actually because then you'll get taxed All for his glory, are you doing this an expert wallet wait, actually it doesn't matter Are you using max and is this an expert or smart wallet? You should be able to access the app using a VPN I have had no issues Do I leave gas if you're an expert wallet, yes If you're an expert mode You will need to leave gas if you are in smart wallet You should not be able to leave gas But please let me know if you are still having issues so that I can note that down Living on the edge Nolan Just a bubble bought register buys from the app Their change now, so I know when I was testing mine my buys did not register I Think some of you were still some of you were still watching though. I Think there was some some buys right after some testing By the way, maybe we should do a contest We should either do two winners or one million PPI prize Which one oh just go it's quiet What are we thinking now easier easier so far Who oh, let me see The hair was this for to 14th yeah, I must have been Let me see, I don't know if I sent this pose number one And it ended in five a five seven Whoever was Number one that means it was the last No But that was Contest channel for you all No Boris and Bannon did not test it yet, I'll test it once we have all your bugs figured out Definitely easier and cleaner signing process awesome I How many entries let me go back 14 entries Can you send me that Actually, I got it all for his glory I will Get back to you as soon as I'm done with the boy shop Forward this right now Gas should be very very little like less than should be pennies So can anybody put my email address in to access my account So what's gonna happen if somebody acts or? Accesses or tries to access your account is this gonna send you a pin to your email and You have to enter that pin into the app like you just did So if you don't have that pin You're not gonna be able to access it But that's another reason to have your email secure. And like I said, we'll add I'll add some other security measures in case you all want to use them Awesome Nice I have my water I have my Celsius Peach vibe, which is one of the best ones And I have an espresso Right.

Is this a martini if it's with tequila? Just bubble but not show them all I guess yes Yeah, when I was testing Oh There's a refill What's the strange video in education the video in marketplace or just placeholders? Yes, correct, oh, yeah, so As far as the contest entries if that's why you're asking about the bubble bot.

That's not what we go off of What if email gets hacked That's why I need to make sure your email secure maybe go by text no actually text is Gonna be a lot less secure From what I've been told by our devs and By the security experts at magic themselves So we will not be doing that It's a lot easier to Get into your your texts By the way, apparently there's some with the Apple update. There's some like What was it my girlfriend sent it to me Something about like old nudes popping up FYI, if any of you have an iPhone not that any of you would have news I I know I just suck. Yeah Yes, there was 14 Which of these networks is currently supported on our app ethereum polygon When will the old balance show up what have you been listening to me?

No you have not Your old balance will not show up in the app we've just started a new account So this is why it was really important to move your funds out of a smart wallet And then if you had funds an expert wallet You will use something like trust wallet and enter your seed phrase there To go ahead and access your funds from your old wallet This Is a completely new account completely new wallet, so if you had your old wallet saved as A send to address make sure you go ahead and change that don't just automatically send to the address Although I don't know why you'd ever do that I don't trust myself to do that.

But just in case keep that in mind This is a whole new address Whole new account even if you're using the same email Address as you used with the old account. That's why it's letting you use The same email address because it's a completely different account with new wallets. Hope that makes sense, but DM me if you need anything else What about using proton mail?

Great idea Probably a lot better than Gmail So they're planned for in the future, yes, we definitely plan on adding More to more coins more networks in the app Just need it to Work well with everything we have now So you guys still Have an answer do we want one 1 million Ppy prize Or do you all want? To 500 K prizes Okay, we'll do two prizes You don't feel bad I've seen I've seen where people have put in like 10 entries out of like less than 20 entries and still not one such a Luck I've used Google random number generator every single time And Stacey Writes down the Wallet addresses when we look at the number of wallets and pick it out that way not that I would Know your wallets by heart So we'll do two prizes Let's see And we'll run it Till tomorrow actually How about that?

Used tranny is lonely in the gulag Lots of entries in two weeks Run till on ramper and goes live We'll have to do another contest for the oh, you know what we'll do another contest for all the testers actually I Need a new chair, can anybody make any chair recommendations? I really like this one Minus I think something broke It's tempur-pedic one. It's the most comfortable one I've had and it has a really large back That actually reaches almost the top of my head not almost Yeah, I think we'll do another contest for all the testers and I will Announce that contest when I give you all the list of things to test And everybody who fills out I'm out bug report Will be entered I Can't really tune in right now.

Well, this was chappy recorded and uploaded tonight. Yes Have to make sure that I was recording You are welcome, I'm excited I'm sure you all will find some bugs. It looks like all for his glory Maybe I already found something So swaps of manic to PPI in new Apple it will be in the contest.

Yes, absolutely Those will all show up and let me know if you need any help Transferring anything into the app or with anything else Yay, awesome, cool. Let me know if you guys need anything else in the meantime. I will be here And We're to all testing So we can get these bugs to the devs Get them solved and then we can deploy the new on rambler for you all to test that So we can begin marketing I'm excited for that Our video is coming along Pretty nicely our first one the intent of this one is to be used for social media and also possibly TPUSA College events basically just any ads So coming along pretty nicely, I think I think you all really enjoy it Really feeling super grateful the last week in the people we've found To Work for us including our advisor including The graphics designer Feeling super super grateful for super super talented people that Have been very patient with us But I'm looking forward to what where we can go with them and then Hopefully everything we can do for them in return So feeling very grateful for that and feeling very grateful for all of you So I do appreciate that.

I Will keep you all updated again. I will post a List of things we'd like you all to test Probably now that I'm thinking about it probably with some instructions Just in case you all need it and then that way hopefully you all can test different things So you're not all testing this same one, you know thing Okay, so will there be a face ID There will be a What magic is working on right now is actually a web auth using your fingerprint on your Device right now. They currently only have that on the desktop version But we are working on implementing that and then they are working on Getting that on your mobile devices. So we will be adding that ASAP and as soon as they have it available Because yes With all the testing I've been doing It's been tiring having to check my email because the app will Kick you off after 15 minutes.

We have it set up that way to keep you all make sure you're all secure I Know most of you hopefully have walks on your phone, but still So, yeah as somebody who's had to log into the app many many many times in the past few weeks I realized what a pain that could be if you're going in there pretty often Still take it over though, you know What we've had in the past still still prefer this and I don't think any of you will lock yourself out I think that'll be very very hard to do Well, the gift card works on the new app, yes our dev Was working on that Last week is it last week or this week?

Yes gift cards will work on the new app Very beautifully So we can transfer a matic into the app, but we can't buy PPI on the app yet, correct You can transfer a matic into the app You can don't transfer PPI just because I don't want you to get taxed so you can transfer a matic You can also transfer if you have USDC USDT or wrapped Bitcoin on the polygon network If you have those on the Ethereum network Use the change now website to swap those in so you don't lose a ton on gas fees But if you have them on the polygon network, you can transfer those in too And that way you can test with that with transferring and swapping Yes gift cards will be awesome Plat no, I'm assuming plaid wire Plaid is a dad of mine assuming that was a version from our old That hasn't been updated Yes Still a believer in this is a way to market to get friends into PPI. Yes.

I actually I'm with you there. I really really really love the PPI gift cards The nice thing about them is to the way we have them Work is when you buy it. You're buying it in stable coin So it actually doesn't swap it into PPI until the Person you gift it to goes to set up their account, which is really really awesome so that's you know in the their best interest pretty much because if you're buying them, you know, if you buy them 20 bucks and Say they put it away.

I'm I'm awful. I have a gift cards From like eight years ago. I actually thought about that this week and put out my to-do list.

I have probably Tens of gift cards that I have not used. I really need to I just don't ever get to them So then All to say it's awesome because Say in that time that you buy them the gift card and they don't check it for a month or two when you bought it for them, you know, it was worth so much and you know, and they finally import it into their app when The price is lower then that's gonna work out for them It's gonna be the most accurate all to say that Instructions are good. Awesome. I will make sure to write that down sometimes I Don't think of that, but I know hopefully that'll make it all easier that along with a contest.

Hopefully you all will be eager to test and help us We can only test so much and we only have so many devices You can transformatic and yes You can transformatic you can also transfer USD T or USD C Now you're gonna be able to do that with much lower gas fees than the few of you who mistakenly did that before and learned Very quickly that the theory was a very expensive No fingerprint boomers hate that why To be fair I I did disable that on Like my trust wallet and stuff like that just for security Security Will the smart expert slider selector be going away why is it still there? Why why the toggle? It will not be going away So that you can still choose What you want?

What mode do you want to be in? all you experts and then who want to pay for your own gas and then Everybody else who doesn't want to deal with that. It should automatically be in smart wallet Nine Matic trade minimum.

Yes, so the trade minimums those are gonna be changed now minimums Not much we could do about those, but I think they're for the most part. They should be pretty Reasonable That's that has to be something that hadn't been updated from before Wire is dead and not applied. We did want to say that was before wire.

It's time But we'll make sure that's actually let me send that to my sauce. I don't forget Discord still all because used Tranny who are you use tranny? Like I feel like I could pin a few different people who you're who your alt is I Think all because you use tranny is in the gulag Okay Well, I think that's Everything I have I've not received any DMS of anybody needing help setting up their account.

So that's great news That's a big difference from Last round of this. We did a few years back I Told you guys it couldn't get any easier. This was a wonderful find.

We are very grateful to be doing business with Magic who by the way is an amazing company Yeah, let me know if you need anything else in the meantime Good luck on the contest. I will Let's see Probably post I'll let you guys know you'll know when I post try and figure out if we do that tonight I'll probably have you test how you want tonight and then we'll I'll get them done tonight. So I'll write some instructions and then Get you all the list of things to test probably before I leave for church tomorrow And get you all started on that If you need anything else in the meantime go ahead and DM me or tag me and I will go ahead and Walk you through anything Other than that feel free I Don't know if you want to wait till on rampart to go ahead and share that with anybody In case they want to sign up for the new app or if you guys want to leave all the excitement once we have our on ramper Let me know if you need anything else in the meantime, I will get the recording up right now before I go to eat I also need a show to watch tonight. I feel like I'm gonna need like a show running in the background while I work Planning to add charts for tokens other than PPI.

Ah, they should be all show No mind, they just weren't loading. Ah, yes, so The app that is one issue that we are aware of the app is running slow Just with we've had several debt devs work on everything. That is something the dev is working on optimizing That's something we're working on It does take a minute I've noticed especially for me this week it seems to be a little bit quicker now that it's actually Deployed on this main branch than it was with testing but Church tomorrow.

Yes, not just doing church community service. I have to go to church to load Is there any way to get seed phrase on the new app not yet we are working on adding that Magic provides that but it is not standard But with this you should have no problem Losing access of your account or getting on any other device You should be good and feel free to test that out to actually I'll write that down on my list to add to Gee Who's that I Don't know Mike that person Or they may not be sad if they didn't So Yeah, feel free to get on different devices to go ahead and test your account so don't think that testing has to include you know any Transactions as far as getting funds in there right now.

You can go ahead and just play around with if you want even the account access portion of it or the account creation to and kind of Mess around with that Whether it's from different accounts or different browsers But should be pretty straightforward Some of you that check your apps Your app Tens of times today though might start getting annoyed with the code, but I think that I'd take that over What we had to deal with before and again, we are working on and magic is working on adding Different login options, so you don't need to go check your email, but Decentralized that's just kidding. That was not him.

Okay. Well, I Think that's all Again, I don't know if we all want to wait until the onvampers deploy to get your friends to sign up but Let's see Wanna Able to purchase black chair, you know, I actually I need a new office chair. So Does you have a price on that I haven't tried Okay, it's a good deal for $15 watch you get like a little one-inch one Little tiny one to put on top of your desk My friend Granddaughter's coming to visit her for the summer.

So She bought a vanity for herself off like one of the Asian apps Her brother put it together for her while she wasn't home and she got home and it was like a total like a baby doll size So now she's like well I could use it for my granddaughter It's a good deal for $15, yeah, well if it sits on your desk, I guess I Actually need office furniture, and I've been having such a hard time Need like a sideboard with storage Plain wood, where do people get furniture from?

I don't even know It's everywhere. I've looked Haven't found what I'm looking for Okay Well, that's all I got Get this converted and get back on I Am waiting on an updated copy The beginning of this launch video, I'm very very excited for Because I think it's a pretty like good height video And actually I think I need to do some voiceovers If you all need anything else reach out For furniture Craigslist, I don't know. I don't know if Craigslist is big over here.

I Feel like that was that was like a long time ago here I have checked marketplace Because it's just super easy on there. I've checked my sister said check target. I've checked just googling.

I've checked Wayfair I've checked the Amazon just because I want it just shipped to my house. I don't want to leave Still being in Chicago. Oh, really?

Check I think that's everything I will see you guys in general chat. I'll go ahead and convert this right now though And get it posted for Chad Somebody was talking about welding the other day and I thought of James All right, um, thank you all Have a wonderful night. Enjoy the app I feel like it's I know when I started testing it like there's nothing like this is too easy.

There's not much to mess with So enjoy that I will see you all in the general chat though. I just gotta once I upload this I'll eat and then I got it Is there anything good to watch? I'm not like a big watcher of TV at all But I feel like tonight I need to have some background noise So if you have anything good to watch on any of the streaming apps I have and never use Let me know And I'll see you guys in the general chat have fun messing with the app I'll get the list out to you for stuff to test in case you're up for that Thank you
