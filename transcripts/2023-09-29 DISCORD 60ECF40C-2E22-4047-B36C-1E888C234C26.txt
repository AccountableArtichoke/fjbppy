[Speaker 1]
I hope everybody had a wonderful week. I feel like it was a really long week, but a really short one too. I don't have any crazy updates.

We are still waiting on final written quotes for the reviews. I do get online tomorrow morning to wrap up everything in a nice little pretty package to get that all ready to send for everybody reviewing it. But that's basically what we're waiting on now.

Third party is still waiting for us so they can start. Let's see. I think that's it.

App is going well. We are also adding a few more things on the list. But of course that hasn't changed those additions.

And simplifying everything as far as logins on the app and account creation. That'll all start after the failed transactions are fixed. Ed is in the side chat.

Oh. What's going on? Busy there.

Awesome. So yeah, that sums up everything that I have. It's been nice on my end because I feel like everything's moving quicker now that we're at the final stages.

We should have the banner graphic ready by the end of the weekend. We have all the graphics for the merch completed. So that's nice.

We're all caught up on any legal forms. Just waiting once we get everything completed. As far as the reviews and the third party.

As soon as the app starts. That's when we can also start the legal part of the name change. Including the LLCs, trademarks, et cetera.

So that, I believe, wraps up everything. At least everything that I can share. All of that has a lot of details.

Yeah. Let's see. I did not get any questions in DMs. I didn't have service for a few hours, though. I was in a doctor's building and the service was scrapping there. So unless something on my end didn't update. But I am on desktop now and I still don't have any questions in DMs. So if I somehow missed that, please DM me again or just ask in here. So we're waiting now for task review before third party. Yes. So we're having multiple parties review everything.

Just to make sure everything is 100% secure. Because third party does not review. If that makes sense.

When you say sending everything over to review, you mean our team will review? No. Our team has already completed review of everything.

We are talking about hiring outside parties to review. When is March launch? March launch, again, is important because that means we can start in person.

In real life events. And that will launch as soon as we have all the graphics completed. We're starting out with a dozen.

So as soon as all those are perfected. When you say sending everything. Oh, I read that one already.

Will we go live in October? I will keep you updated. Right now, that's still the time frame we're in.

Literally just waiting on the review. I have one quote that is due Monday morning. Very early Monday morning.

And that's the major one we're waiting for. Any mention on how long for the audit? I'm assuming for the review.

We have multiple parties. We've gotten anywhere from one to three days. Two.

Give me a second. I want to give you the exact number. Two, 12 to 15 days.

Two, 15 to 18 days. Again, the one I get Monday will be pretty much the major one. But I will update you on that.

And that's just third-party testing. Outside of bar testing. Outside of death testing.

Security will remain a top priority. All outstanding items completed within the next seven days. Not sure what you mean by all outstanding items because we have quite a load.

What's the ETA for task review? I think I just answered that. Is Patriot Pay registered for any future GOP events?

No, we are still waiting. A few legalities that we have to wait until a few other steps happen before we can continue on our end. What was the estimate from the major one?

Oh, the time estimate? Monday morning. We will learn.

We'll get a quote and a timeframe from them. I did ask him. That was scheduled this morning.

I did ask him if he does have anything open up today or this weekend to let me know. But he doesn't work on the weekends at that company. And he said today was likely booked and did not hear from him.

So it will be Monday morning. What time was that actually? Let's check.

I mean, will the audit, I'm assuming review, be done? Will the review be done in the next seven days? I will let you know.

That really depends on how everything goes on their end. As you all know, testing, actually very recently for us, testing has gone amazing. So hopefully that keeps going.

But if it does not and doesn't go as expected and functions are not functioning as intended, then that does stretch on longer. Is it a professional audit company that will do the audit? No, this is more of a review.

But I will keep you all updated. It's a review being done. And the review does consist of testing.

One of you, I'm assuming you're in the chat. So if you're here now or listening in later, somebody here emailed me for help to get their coins off XT. Haven't heard back.

Hopefully that means you were successful in following the directions. If you are still having trouble moving your coins off XT, please feel free to email, DM me, tag me. If you need any help doing that, please get your coins off XT as soon as possible.

They've not given us a hard deadline. But better to be safe than sorry. So please get your coins off there ASAP.

If you need help transferring again, please reach out. Was there something that happened that triggered the team to want a review? No.

So we actually already had the reviews done by the devs. However, the third party wanted with the nature of the task and everything included on that, they suggested that we get everything reviewed again. So we are doing that.

But yes, security has remained a top priority. That hasn't changed. Along with doing everything we can with the resources we have to make sure that we have the best chance of success to grow the community.

You see this being revealed before the end of October. However, right now the way it's looking, yes. If the reviews change that, I will let you know.

There's not really anything we can do to speed it up. We have multiple different teams of devs. We have multiple dev teams working on it.

So basically we can only hire so many devs so that they don't get into each other's way. How many devs? 10 to 12.

Have they all been paid? They are all caught up on payments for the completed work. I'm assuming that's what we're asking.

We usually pay after the work is completed. Some devs want it split up into payments before they start work. Once they're testing and once it's finalized.

Another team of the devs we have takes half in the beginning, half at completion. So it really just depends on how they want to get paid. But yes, we are all caught up on payments.

Where have you been, by the way? Oh my gosh, you're about me. What is wrong with you?

Innocent eyes. Oh, that's exciting. Wait, are you the one who sent me coins once for Baklava?

Who did that? Somebody did that. It was on Telegram.

It was a really long time ago. And you all have changed your handles so many times. I need to find out who sent me coins for Baklava.

If anybody finds whoever that was. I thought it was you. Who was it?

Whoever sent me coins way back, a few years back, maybe like two Christmases ago. Would you please DM me? I'm not sure who it is.

Most of you have changed your handles so many times I've lost count. I tried to search a while ago. But they must have deleted our thread.

But please reach out so I know who it was. Thank you. Now you're just making stuff up.

Now you're being like Sherlock. Saying it's his birthday. Mid the audit, assuming you're talking about the review, can you choose the one that gives the shortest estimate?

Pretty please. So we will have a few different ones. We can discuss this, all the details, once we're live.

But we will have a few different parties doing the review. It'll be worth the extra. Alright, Petey Sherlock.

Oh, hi. He's right there, you liar. Anything else?

How's B&B doing today? Let's see. 215.

Have you chosen any of the audit firms? I'm assuming we're still talking about the companies and devs we're hiring to review everything. No, we have not chosen all of them.

We are going with a few. Okay, Sherlock killed Sherlock, I guess. You guys are about to get us in trouble and have the server shut down, goodness.

By the way, I guess Biden was in town today. I think I drove past him too. Let's see.

I don't know why he was here, but I know he was in town too. Probably. Yeah, sure.

Okay, anything else? I don't see Ed typing, so I think that probably is everything. I think you guys probably saw the survey that we had in Telegram, so we'll get that on the banner.

We already turned that in this morning. I'll update you once that's complete. We'll keep it single for now.

Again, that's just for the 4 Patriots. Bye, Patriots. I'm actually not sure.

Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
What did that end up on?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, 85%. Wow. With 55 votes.

Okay, well. Oh my gosh, FUBU. Oh, did you guys see?

I don't know why FUBU ended me like that. Chewbacca killer. I was reading that while I was at the doctor's office.

What do you expect to happen over the next week? So, tomorrow I wrap up everything that the devs have completed. That puts it in a nice little package for everybody reviewing it.

Hopefully we get a few more quotes this weekend, and then Monday morning should be our final quote. Decisions will be made, assuming we do get that quote Monday morning like we are supposed to and like we're scheduled to. That decision will be made by end of day Monday.

Devs will start on it as soon as they start on it. We've gotten quotes from one day to 18 days. Quite a range there.

Which puts us at Sunday. Sunday is October 1st, so it's going to be first Sunday at church. So, that kind of makes it easy.

At the very most, that puts us at October 19th, which is enough time. Less than 10 days for third party to get started. They're ready to get started as soon as we're done reviewing.

That still puts us in October still. That should be plenty of time. With that, the app, assuming that the devs don't get stuck again.

I would hope that the app is transactions failing, are fixed, and a few other things are added. As far as getting easier account creation and easier logins for existing users. I can't even get in my app right now because I'm getting that blue circle of death.

We should be back on the Apple App Store. The banner should be back this week. Our merch should be completed by the end of the week.

As soon as that's completed, we'll have events along with another TPUSA call. We're waiting on our end to give TPUSA another call. So, they're all still waiting on us.

Still working on the white paper. Busy, busy week. Sorry, that probably wasn't that quick, Ed.

What shampoo do you use? I don't know the name of it, but it's something super natural. Because my hair is pretty dang long.

It's reaching, like, my fingertips now. So if I had my hands all the way down, or my arms all the way down to my side. It's reaching the end of my fingertips.

Probably need to trim. Why are you asking what shampoo I use? I did have to wash my hair today.

Takes forever. Made me want to chop it off, actually. That's weird.

My neighbor with the FJB stickers on their truck just drove by, but they don't live this way. You don't come back here unless you live this way. I wonder what they're doing.

Alright, folks. Well, I think that wraps it up. If you do have any questions come up, please feel free to tag, DM, or email me.

I'm getting... containing all my excitement. It's getting pretty old.

But we are getting closer, and there's more work being done. Stuff is definitely progressing, so that's nice. It's moving a lot quicker on my end.

So that's making at least time go a little bit faster for me, and I am very grateful for that. Again, get your coins off XT, please. If you need help, please reach out so we can get you taken care of.

I think that's all. Thank you all for His glory, for the prayer. Prayer is always welcome.

Welcome. Can't hurt. Alright, I will see you guys in the general chat.

I will write some notes and post this right now, the recordings, on both Discord and Telegram. You guys have a great night. Again, let me know if you need anything else.

I will talk to you soon.
