Friday.

[Speaker 1]
I hope everybody had a great week. Our dev has had a great week so far. I guess we have several more hours.

A few more days, technically. Yeah, I don't have any huge updates. The dev is still working.

We've made a few administrative, just administrative progress, I guess, this week. That was a big win. So excited for that.

I'm hoping by Tuesday that we'll have the name to announce, that we'll be able to announce the new app name. So I'll keep you updated on that. I'm doing everything I can on my end to hopefully ensure that happens.

But other than that, everything's still going well. That's it, really. Somebody was saying B&B's down.

Let's see. Not terrible. 309.

But yeah, that's it. That's all I really got. Everything else is still to be completed by the end of the month.

We have what, 11, 12 days left? Again, if that changes, I will definitely let you know. But that's it.

Once we're able to announce the name change and once that's 100% decided on, we'll get the website going and our website's redirecting there. Like I said, our coin name is staying the same. How many hours of the 40 are left to finish?

Dallas is asking because I believe Tuesday we had about 40 hours of dev work left. I don't have the hours on hand for you. I'm sorry.

I want to say around 20 to 25, but don't quote me on that. All for his glory. Ooh, enjoy work.

Hopefully it's a quick shift. Thank you for the prayers as always. With the app name changing, any idea how long it will take to push the name through to the app stores?

Not sure about that. I know we had some updates this week that we had to take with Apple that we just completed. So I'm not sure.

I don't have that answer for you right now, but I'll definitely keep you updated as that happens. Very excited for that because remember the main reason we were changing the name is to just get accepted a little bit more easily with a name other than FJB, even with Freedom Jobs business. Nobody from the community has been scammed recently, so that's very good.

I feel like for a while we had that where every week or two somebody was losing their coins, so nice job on that. Has the dev had to wait on the team for much directions? I think the majority of that was at the beginning.

Late arrival, how many hours of dev work remaining? I want to say around 25, but I don't have an exact number right now. And the dev having to wait on the team for direction was more when we had some decisions to be made, so I'm sure that'll come up again.

But we're good right now. Let's see. I'm trying to get something.

A price on the app. Do you think possible to announce big changes by next Friday? Honestly, I couldn't tell you.

I definitely think that's possible. But, never know. Looks like a price on the app is still on sale.

The API.

[Speaker 2]
Bernard.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not sure about Bernard's question. Would More Room regularly reboot mods? Ed.

I'm honestly not sure, just because I couldn't. So Ed asked, with More Room regular weekly spots planned for quarter three, what month in your estimate you think we can achieve that? I honestly couldn't tell you that just because that has, you know, we can do everything we can on our end.

But ultimately, B&B have the final say and when any of that happens. So we will do our best to, of course, get everything on our end completed and everything that B&B request. However, it ultimately is up to B&B.

So, we'll definitely keep you updated on that. Oh my gosh, Donny. So approximately four days of task work remains.

Yes and no, because I don't want to say four days, again, just because as soon as the dev gets to something that requires more decisions from the team, that's kind of what's taken the most time. So, has the name been decided on now? You mentioned it was a possibility you'd announce names soon.

How does that look? Yeah, I think I mentioned that, sorry, right before you got on, MP. We are shooting to announce the name by Tuesday.

We'll do everything in our power to hopefully do that, but that's just what we're shooting for. That actually is so funny. Leg reminds me so much of my little brother.

I think he's like way older though, but he reminds me so much of my little brother. That's the funniest thing I've read all week though. Oh my gosh, what is wrong with you?

Is that what you guys do in Ireland? Oh yeah, Mary Spite, you're right, I forgot Spite was a mod, because he's the only normal one. There's no way for you guys to pin that either.

You pinned my other Spite comments. Yeah, trying to get app price. So our telegram, let me see, if our telegram price bot is still broken.

That has nothing to do with us, I promise. That's just the bot itself broken, but then our app price. Will there be discrete app and token roadmaps at some point in the near future?

So we assume as this task is completed, depending on exactly how long that takes, we will get that approved to have everything, including the roadmap, more accurate one for you guys, since we're obviously behind now. Any closer on deciding the app logo? So the app logo, we're waiting until the name is 100% finalized.

Finalized, again, hoping that's all. We're shooting for Tuesday. Get that all completed and announced to you all.

Yeah. What is the value proposition of the FJB token? The name is changing to something that's presumably not a meme, meaning any pretentious meme coin seems to be gone.

We are taking, we're working on the changes on the task at hand right now. Once that is completed and we have the app functioning, we'll move on to that. Will the website and app be more integrated?

That's the goal. That's the goal. After the task the dev's working on right now is completed, the next priority, sorry.

The next priority will be getting the app functional. I know how frustrated you all are by a lot of functions on the app not working. From there we'll have the new website, the current websites that will be directed to the new website, and everything comes after that.

I know it's one step at a time. Try not to get too ahead of ourselves, but as soon as we, we'll keep you updated through all the changes. What mechanisms will exist to allow the community to derive some return from the success of the app?

We'll keep you updated. I know we discussed this, or at least a few of you asked this a few weeks back, but we'll share everything once we get there, I promise. I'll keep you updated.

How soon do you think after the task is completed will the work begin? I'm so sorry, I keep forgetting to read. How soon do you think after the task is completed will the work begin on app functionality right away?

Yes. With the task at hand, we do expect some road bumps, I suppose. That's just the way it is, it's not just us.

We're anticipating that. We do appreciate your patience once that happens. And hope everybody will give us that grace once we work through that and through the anticipated road bumps.

The dev, of course, will assist with all that once that's all completed and squared away and everybody's great, the dev will start working on the app. So there is a plan, but you just aren't sharing it. There's a few different ideas are floating around.

Nothing has been set in stone or decided on. It might be a good idea to ask the community what they prefer to once we get there. I think that might be a good idea, although sometimes that bites us back.

Really want to know what the task is. The suspense is killing me. I think it'll be great.

One thing to note is really just asking for the community's patience. We initially got approved for this and then we didn't. We were told to wait again.

I do believe the main reason for that is just not wanting to deal with the community's, I don't know, maybe backlash, because by definition things will be shaken up a bit. We, again, appreciate your patience in advance. We will get through it, but I think it really is the best decision for the future of the coin, for the holders, for future holders, and I think everybody will really, really, really appreciate it.

Does the task involve a third party? No, wouldn't say so. Not the way I'm thinking of it, anyway.

Has it been a good week? Yeah, definitely. Smooth sailing.

We also, like I said, got a few administrative items off the list, so that was great. Is Velo the dev currently working on it? No.

Not Velo, unfortunately not Newman. I don't know what happened to him. He just disappeared one day and he's not on any of his websites that he was listed on before, so I really hope he's okay.

I'm sincerely worried for his well-being. If anybody knows Newman, let us know, please. Let us know that he's alive.

If any of you are neighbors with him or something, let me know. Still on track for May? Yes.

We are still on track right now. If that changes, I will definitely let you know. So far, so good, though.

We have plenty of time. But again, if that changes, I appreciate the patience in advance. I'm really sorry in advance if that changes, but I know what it's looking like.

Everything should be on track. For the purpose of record keeping, are documents being stored centrally? Obviously, code is being managed through GitHub per you on a previous voice, but what about everything else?

So our advisor, who came on a few months ago, basically we go by his direction, and he has access to everything. Where things are stored or how they're stored, if we ever need to send anything, like sensitive files, we just have to go through. I just follow directions.

It's a process that he asks for. I don't make those decisions. I just follow the directions.

[Speaker 2]
Winston! That's not nice.

[Speaker 1]
What are the chances of a war room mention? When we've discussed that before, B&B basically wants us to get our stuff together before we're back on war room again. The same goes for B&B joining voice either here or on Telegram.

That is all per Boris. I'll update you if that changes. Who specifically has access to contract owner private keys?

I do. B&B do. Their previous I don't want to say previous, but I mean, he's still on the team.

War room employee, high up employee, and our new advisor. Hypothetically, if you were to leave the team entirely, would everything project-related in your possession be secure, assuming you were to become a malicious party? This is hypothetical.

I think you're basically asking if we have multisig right now, which we do not right now. When looking at the project as a whole, what needs to be done prior to launch? Launching, marketing, war room, etc.

Off the top of my head, when looking at the project as a whole, what needs to be done prior to launch? Launch being marketing, war room, etc. The current task, yes, absolutely.

App, launch ready. 100%. I believe the websites completed along with our new branding, rebranding.

So our logos and gift cards are already completed. I'd like to see our merch updated and our merch store. Basically everything I don't know if that would go with rebranding.

All of our social media updated. The way I see it is if somebody who has never heard of this goes online, our chat's cleaned up. I like to think of it that way.

So if somebody who's never heard of us hears of us and goes to Google us and everything that comes up, basically our Discord or Telegram. But I don't think, I think once this task is completed and then the app work, I think that's really everything else I think could be done in a time crunch. When viewing the project or timeline from a planning perspective what is the timeline Q3, Q4, 2024 I think this is continuing the previous question I'm assuming.

I would say definitely this year. I think that's plenty of time. But again, can't say because we haven't run into anything.

We're only in May. Is the name decided? We're hoping to get that 100% decided and hopefully announced by Tuesday.

My goal to do everything we can on our end to get that all to you by Tuesday. Will the team use this dev for the affixes? So far so good.

We'll see how the rest of everything goes, but I don't see a reason why. We'll let you know if that changes. What's the status of the investigation into previous malicious actors?

I'm going to stay away from that. If you're referring to the missing funds I do not have an update on that. As soon as I have an update for you all, I promise I will share that with you.

Are you still using Google services for collaboration? We mainly use ProtonMail. Where or how did you find this new dev?

Through two sources. When you received the private keys from whoever they came from what was the means of transmission? In an email that we asked them exactly how to send it to make sure that it was safe.

And secure. Again, I don't make those decisions. People are much smarter than me.

Just follow the directions. Did you just say that the keys were sent via email? Yes, through an encrypted file.

Is the McNifty portfolio an fjreecoin.org feature? Actually, they haven't spoken for a few months. I wonder how they're doing.

I know last few times we spoke, they're just waiting. They're just waiting for the market. Oh my gosh, Redis.

What is wrong with you? You guys are wild. Sorry, Nolan.

I feel like you're about to have a heart attack. Will the task generate income flow for the coin project? So forgive me for being so short about this.

I'm just trying not to really dive into this to say too much. But I think you'll agree that yes, in the long term it will be best for the project for the current holders future holders for sure, and really just the future of the coin. So yeah, we can obviously discuss that as that goes on.

Again, we do appreciate your patience in advance for any other roadmaps that will come up, but we'll get through them. As long as we're moving forward, that happens. Everything's not going to be perfect.

I do realize how frustrating that is to hear after everything we've all been through. But here we are. We've got to get through it.

And then, again, we're still here. Could be worse. The important part is we are getting better.

We are moving forward. And hopefully this will help everything move forward. I like that nobody even flinched at Reddice.

I don't know. Does everybody remember making them normal comments like this? I don't understand.

Oh, thank you. Nice. And again, I do appreciate everybody's patience.

Trust me. I'm just as frustrated. We will get through it.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. becomes first presidential candidate to accept Bitcoin campaign donations. That's some good news.

We'll be very welcome. When is FJB token forking? Will the same devs doing the app development be doing the contract fork?

Not sure. We will see how all this goes. Of course, we would love to keep our same devs with everything for a great match.

If we're not, or if they're too busy, then... Are the devs anonymous? This one, the current dev we have, is actually I think he is willing to reveal himself.

Or I think he will be. He said he is willing to get on a voice chat with the community to answer questions. We'll give that sometime, probably once this test is completed, because we don't want him to accidentally reveal anything.

Who is auditing the app? Actually, we'll have... This is being discussed.

It might be a dev who has worked on the app before. But that has not been finalized. We'll let you know when that's decided.

Somebody I really like. He's like a genius. Will the payment infrastructure be PCI compliant?

Not sure about that. I don't know what that means. I'm sorry.

Still seems so much vagueness. Just with the nature of our app, most just not most, but a few of the contractors we've had not most, just a few, have wanted to stay anonymous due to the nature the political nature of our app, whether it's that or whether due to the nature of their own full-time job. Baseline certification, that many business insurance policies require for payment system to be covered.

I'm not sure, but I did add that to the list of my questions for the team. Thank you for that. Why do you have the contract keys?

Because that's what B&B and the advisor at the time wanted me to do. I was the person to retrieve them from the previous team. Alright, I think that's all.

So to recap, everything with the bag is still going well. Nothing new to report there. No new decisions made as far as that goes.

I am doing everything I can to announce the new name of the app by Tuesday, finalizing that and announcing it to you all. As far as dev hours left, I'd say around 25 hours or so. I will update you.

We are still on track to have this completed by the end of May. If that changes, I definitely will keep you updated. Thank you for your patience.

Once this is completed and we get through any of the road bumps that we do anticipate, then we will have the devs start on getting the app 100% functional ASAP. That's all. Again, please don't share your keys with anybody that includes any kind of support on Telegram, on Discord.

I feel like it happens more on Telegram a lot more often. Please, even if somebody's profile looks like me, it doesn't matter. If it is me or any of the other admins, you should never send your seed phrase or enter it into some sketchy links.

It's been a few weeks, actually, maybe several weeks since we've had a member of the community scammed, so I just don't want that to happen anytime soon. It always seems to happen when one of you is having an off day. Somebody had COVID.

Somebody was going through a divorce. Obviously, I get it. You're not idiots.

It just happens on a day that you're not thinking straight. But please, please, please remember, don't ever share that with anybody including me or any kind of support. Let me know if you guys have anything else.

I will keep you updated. Have a wonderful Friday night and stay safe. I will get the recording up right now with some bullet points.

Alright, bye.
