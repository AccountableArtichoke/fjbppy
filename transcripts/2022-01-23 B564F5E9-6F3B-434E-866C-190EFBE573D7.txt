[Speaker 1]
That was a, that was actually really fun music.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, Eric, if that's, that's been our theme song since the beginning, the pump it up. It's like, I, now I say it like I hear it in my dreams. I hear it all the time now.

And, and I love it. Oh, Ryan Fornier is in here as well. He's saying that his license plate is now hashtag FJB.

Hey Ryan, we love, we love having you in here. Uh, it's always, it's always a treat. You're, you're one of the first, uh, influencers and endorsers and, uh, big name people we had on, on the team.

And that was a huge, I remember that day when we finally got Ryan, um, and it was awesome. It was really incredible. So to, to see him still around just shows how tremendous this coin is.

Cause we're building something absolutely awesome. And I remember saying that, uh, we were building the monsters like, uh, like in space jam and he was, he was our point guard.

[Speaker 1]
I love it. I love it. Ryan, Ryan is a king in every sense of the word in so many ways.

[Speaker 2]
He's a, he's a B there. He is. He Ryan's a beast.

He's I, Ryan's a great guy and, uh, we, we love having him here, but Eric, the, the news today was, was, was unbelievable. It was absolutely incredible. It was awesome.

And, uh, yeah, I would love, I would love to hear you, uh, to go, go talk about it and, and really emphasize what's going on.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, absolutely. So no, I mean, my first goal in, uh, in, in wanting to be involved with this project was to get something that is insanely easy, uh, uh, for like, you know, just a normal person, you know, like, not like some of us here are hardcore complicated crypto people, but just making this super easy. So you don't have to jump through five fucking hoops to goddamn actually pardon my French freaking hoops.

Um, to like, actually like get ahold of this, right. I mean, like, you know, to be able to use this as a tool and not just make it easy for people, but making this, so this tool can be used across the entire country. I mean, the goal of this is to get this in the hands of the 75 million plus, plus, uh, people who voted for Trump.

Um, and, uh, and, and even more than that, but that's kind of the first market, you know, 75 million holders, right. Which I actually think it's achievable with kind of this, with a political push. And because you look at my pillow, they got banned Flynn.

He got banned. Trump got banned from a bazillion million banks. I mean, this is, I mean, they targeted even freedom phone on top of that.

Initially. I mean, it's just, this is, this is what's needed across the country and actually having an app and a tool, um, that will be coming out shortly. Uh, you know, obviously we're still finishing development, still working on the developments.

Um, and we have to rely on these, uh, you know, just kind of the, the tedious app store onboarding process. But for real, like it's, this is, this is what we need to get this in the hand of, of, of not just crypto people, but normal people, um, and people that can actually use it. So if you're like a merchant, if you're like a small business that even just runs like a little bar, coffee shop, um, or you happen to sell homemade pillows, you can accept this, um, at your small business.

And I think that's, that's another feature of this app and to be able to send it, you know, anywhere in the world. I mean, I think that's, that's also a part of this, right. Anywhere across the country, instantly across the world.

I mean, that's the, that's the dream of this. And I think that's what so many of these cryptocurrencies have forgotten is that, Hey, we actually want people to use this, you know, it's not all just about the price, although, you know, I love the song that came on, but I mean, for real, I mean, the way, the best price, the best way to, uh, uh, get people invested in a project like this is to get people actually using it. And I think that's really important.

So, um, you know, we, you saw those designs today, which I think were really exciting. I think they're really beautiful. Um, and, and every single way we put a lot of work into them and I, you know, everyone on war room loved it when we were on today, which was insanely exciting.

And, you know, and I just loved seeing everybody in the discord. I thought that was hilarious as well. But once we have this, I feel like that is our true, you know, true, like we had the Saturn five rocket built at that point.

Like I'd say right now we have the fuel, but not the Saturn five rocket. And I think when that app is out and we have all the other amazing technical things we're doing, we have the Saturn five rocket to put all the amazing fuel that we have into it. And I really, I just think it's just, it's just going to be an incredible, incredible, quick journey.

Um, credible, long, but quick journey as well, um, from there. But anyways, I'm ranting at this point, but it's just, I'm just so excited that this is actually, I mean, really like you're going to see no other crypto pot project has pulled this together this quickly. And, and you'll see it when it's out, you'll see the proof is in the pudding when it's out.

I mean, it's just, and, and it's not just having the app, the marketing push that we're going to put behind that app is going to be one of the biggest marketing, one of the best marketing campaigns you'll, you'll ever see for not just a crypto project, but really any project period.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, absolutely. Eric, you hit on so many tremendous points. And, and I think the most important part of this is, uh, 93 days ago, uh, when this project, I always reference how, how young this project is, is 93 days ago, when I started this project, my number one objective was to get this coin, people, Agaboomers, our, our target demographic, the 70, not even just Magaboomers, but the 74 million plus, plus emphasis on the plus people that voted for Donald Trump in 2020. And I said, how can we get 1% of that population?

70, 740,000 people. How can we get that? And what you need is an app.

And we're solving that because look how successful this project has done. Look how successful this coin has done in these 93 days without even scraping the surface of touching our target demographic. And I think that you guys should all see that and understand that because it's so crucial because we have done all of this.

We have over almost 9,000 holders. I probably say with the exchanges and everything, probably 10 to 12,000, uh, holders of FJB. And it's not easy to get right now.

It's, it's only people that are experienced with crypto can get this. What this app is going to do is it's going to get the people, the everyday people that are fed up with the way that this country is being ran right now, the opportunity to get FJB. So simple.

It's I posted this in the chat before I said, it's going to be easier than buying toilet paper on Amazon. It's going to be that easy. That is 74 million plus people can get the FJB coin.

It's going to be that tremendously simple. So just think that if you're in this discord call right now, you are that early that we haven't even touched our target demographic. We haven't even touched the people that I set out in the beginning to able to reach yet, and we haven't even done that yet.

And just think of how far we've come already. And we haven't, we haven't even scraped the surface. We are just getting started.

This app is the, in my opinion, the biggest news yet, because the number one thing that I've seen from probably thousands of people that I've talked to from start to finish, I've probably talked to thousands of people that said, Hey, I, it's just, it's too hard to buy. I'm sorry. I wish I could, but when it gets easier, let me know.

I there's thousands, if not millions of people that are out there that know about this and that just wish it was easier. And that's what this is going to do.

[Speaker 1]
A hundred percent. You're absolutely right, Grant. And I mean, that's, I mean, that's it.

I mean, I, I'm just so excited about this coming out. I mean, this is, I mean, this is just, this is just the beginning of this process. And again, like you said, we're just 90 something days into this and, and the momentum that we have is, is, is, is only increasing.

I mean, it really, it's really amazing. I don't know. I feel like I have nothing more to say than, than the app.

And, and this is probably, and once we have the app launch, it's probably going to be our, one of the best marketing campaigns ever, so I'm down to take questions if you want, but I mean, if you want to elaborate more, let me know. But I mean, that's, that's, that's basically it. I mean, it's just, there's nothing more to say.

I hope you guys liked the mock-ups and everything. Um, shout out to, uh, uh, who's the guy that has the Apple logo in his name? What's his, what's the rest of his username?

You did some. Attic was, is, is, uh, he's been, he's been, yeah, we have, uh, for putting, for putting that out on those phones. I mean, that, that was incredible.

So big shout out for that. Um, he's, he's an incredible person. Um, and, uh, and, and yeah, I mean, just, just big, big shout out to him because we're going to be using those and then, and we love it.

So, uh, absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
He, he actually created these, the Snapchat filters that you see on some people's, uh, uh, avatars. Uh, so it's the FJB, the FJB aviator glasses, uh, which is awesome. Yeah.

Uh, Attic has been, he's been, we've, we have just a tremendous community. So many, uh, members of our team, so many crucial pieces, um, moderators and, and just admins and people that have been here since the beginning, uh, are just in the coin and, and they're just holders of the coin. And, uh, I don't know them.

I don't know anything about them. I don't know their real name. I don't know where they live, where they're from, how old they are, but day in and day out, they're here.

They're working on the coin. They're shilling to the public. They're telling their family and their friends, um, about everything.

They're telling them about the coin.

[Speaker 1]
People are tipping Attic. That is so nice.

[Speaker 2]
That is so sweet. Yeah, it's perfect. I love when people start to go on, uh, like tip parades and tip parties.

This community, this board is awesome. The telegram is awesome. Uh, we just have, I am so convinced that we have the best community out of any coin, uh, in the, in the world.

I I've been in other discords, um, with other coins, other projects, other NFTs. And I have never, I've never seen this before. Never, never, never.

[Speaker 5]
And so it's, I love this community.

[Speaker 1]
Ryan, Ryan, do you want to come up? Is he still here? Yeah.

Is Ryan in here? Ryan, where is he at? I saw him posting.

[Speaker 2]
He is. Oh, he wants to, he, he requested to speak Ryan. We, we even had Ryan up here and in a while he came.

Ryan, what's going on, buddy?

[Speaker 3]
Hey Ryan. We are going to build a big wall in Mexico and pay for that wall with FJB coin.

[Speaker 1]
That's one of the best impressions I've heard. I love that.

[Speaker 3]
I know it's it's believe it or not. I told, I don't know if I've told this community, that story where with students for Trump, when I first started it, you know, we had no clue, you know, what in the hell we were doing in the first place we learned as we were going. One of the ways we funded that was me doing impersonations on Fiverr.

I kid you not, I did impersonations in the Trump voice for like freaking car dealerships, radio shows. They wanted that voice because Trump was in, I mean, he's still in demand, but yeah, no funded part of students for Trump. I think 25, $30,000 came from voice impersonations on Fiverr.

So I didn't know that about, I know.

[Speaker 1]
No, someone should do a mini documentary on, on you, Ryan. I think I would watch it. I would pay for it.

[Speaker 3]
I know. I know. Well, the BBC did one on us in 2016 and, and you know how the BBC is, they make you look terrible.

So I'll have to do another one. It'll have to be hosted by a FJB coin or maybe a Bannon's war room. It's all fake and it's all fake, you know?

So I literally, I have to say though, you guys have done incredible work, this community in the last, I mean, freaking three weeks, if even that as, as just tripled in size, people are coming in from everywhere. I'm starting to now hear about this coin when I go to events. It really is kicking off.

[Speaker 1]
It is, it is. I mean, we've gotten so many people, they've been, they've been just wanting to join the project or even wanting back into the project and everything. I mean, it's just, it's just, it's just incredible.

I mean, I've had so many people, all my people, all my friends are like, I got to buy some of this, you know, and everything, I mean, and, and not just, you know, and then, and then tell me when you have the app immediately. I mean, it's going to be, it just, it's just really, I mean, once we have this app and you see the designs, they're, they're beautiful, beautiful designs. I mean, truly.

And it's just, I mean, I just think once we have that tool in our tool belt to be able to give to people, I just, I just think it's, it's just, it's just a, it's a manifest destiny to getting to 75 million holders of this coin. I really, I, that, that is our goal. And I think, and I think that can be our destiny here.

[Speaker 3]
No, I think you're right. And the app was a very smart move. And I really do commend you guys for that because, and I choked about this earlier in the chat, I said, you know, wouldn't it be an idea if getter allowed users, cause I know how close Jason Miller is with, with Bannon and Boris, wouldn't it be a awesome feature for people to be able to tip each other on getter with the FJB coin?

I mean, it, it, Twitter just rolled out a feature. Now you can, you can send money to people's Venmo or cash app right off their profile. I'm like, what if getter did the revolutionary step of allowing people to tip on with Dogecoin, with Bitcoin, with FJB coin, you know, totally revolutionize it, no one is doing that.

No one.

[Speaker 1]
No, I agree. I agree. And no, we need, we need to get them on the phone, you know, and, and, and get them to, because I mean, I just think that would be massive for getter and everything.

I mean, this is a thing that is so hard to get fiat to crypto on ramps. And, and you know, when you'll see the release of this app, we're going to be pulling it off and everything. I mean, it's just, it is, there's actually like very few people that actually do that and do that well.

And I think, I think in the end product of this, it's going to be, it's going to be really well, cause I've, I've worked on fiat to crypto on ramps on a couple other projects for a while now. So, I mean, this was like, I was like, when, when I hopped on board and wanted to get involved, I was like, did this is the, this is the number one thing I want to bring and start first. I mean, it's just, it's just exactly.

[Speaker 3]
It was so smart to do that though. It was so smart, the app, because one of the biggest complaints I had when I, cause I, I'm new to crypto. I got in last year around the AMC GME boom and learned a lot, lost some money.

You know, made my fair share of mistakes, not an expert like you, but one of the things that I did kind of learn going through this process of that, if it's not easy to buy people, you know, you're going to get lesser audiences. And I know that Bandon's audience for the most part is, is decently, you know, middle-aged to older individuals. So for them to be able to just download an app, add credit card information, be able to purchase this and then have other businesses that allow this as a currency to purchase their products is revolutionary.

It adds beyond utility purpose to this. It makes it, cause there's so many patriotic businesses out there. If you think about it, I mean, you have Freedom Phone.

You, you have, what's that coffee company? I can't remember the name of them.

[Speaker 1]
There's so many different, they, they, they took wall street, Democrat wall street money. That's who you're referring to. They did.

And then they did a transgender fashion show and everything. And then the founders of it went on the New York times and they said, if you're a Trump supporter, we don't want your money and everything. So, I mean, Black Rifle Coffee sold people out.

So it's, that's a shame.

[Speaker 3]
You know, and those guys, I remember in 2019, they were right at the NRA convention when all that stuff was going down with Oliver North and they had a big boot set up and they were so nice. And so how, you know, they were so grateful to be around everybody there. That was like MAGA supporting Trump people, I guess really to get their money.

But no, it's good that they were ratted out and called out them. I didn't know that.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, they did a big, after they took their wall street money, they did transgender fashion show and New York times, um, uh, interview. I mean, it's crazy. I mean, but that's, that's the thing.

It's like, you know, you need to get people that actually care about it. Like, you know, that Mike Lindell cares about it. I care about it.

Grant cares about it. You know, you care, like actually being genuine and not just being fake for money. I mean, you get a lot of those people.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you do. Well, and that's one of the biggest things with, I think any of these coins and the, the LGB coin, I think they had a big issue with that too. Is, I mean, you know, and, and I'm not officially a part of the team here at FJB, so I can say what I want, but I will be very, uh, nice, I guess.

I'll be as nice as I can be. Uh, you know, a hedge fund guy running a crypto coin within the cryptocurrency sphere, and then trying to gain the trust of people isn't exactly something, uh, that I believe is going to work. And, and I've been in this lesser than probably both of you.

And I saw that as a red flag, right? And, and I think many people do. It's, you gotta, you know, gain the trust of the base.

You gotta work to, uh, actually deliver on your ideals, the promises of what the project is. And, and this team has done that every single time this team has delivered. Uh, and so, I mean, that, that is so important.

So critical, I think in, in building this is, is just really the track record so far with everything. And I mean, Grant, you've been phenomenal. I don't think you get enough credit holding this thing together.

And within the time period, uh, from when you started it to now, uh, this is just unbelievable, unseen, unbelievable, unheard of, and I think it's going to go tenfold very, very soon. I mean, this is amazing.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for the kind words. I remember the first time that we spoke, that was like early November. And, uh, I remember, yeah, we were like on a zoom call and I was like, wow, we're getting Ryan on here.

I was like, I remember we used to follow Ryan when I was like back in high school. And I was like, and now, now we're getting him, uh, on, uh, affiliated with the coin was, it was really tremendous and I'm getting old. I'm not, I'm not, I'm, I'm only a couple of years younger than you.

And, uh, and it was, it was just funny. I was like, oh, this thing is like really, like really forming into something. And, um, I wouldn't want to say like it was, it was an overnight thing.

Um, but it really has come to fruition really quickly. And we have, we have such a long way to go because, uh, Eric and I and you and everybody, uh, see the vision, everybody in here on, on tonight's discord call sees the vision and it just takes everybody. Um, this, this coin wasn't, wasn't built by one person.

It was built by every single one of the holders. And that's the reason why we're still here. We, we wouldn't be here without this community and helping everybody out.

And it's, I, we do have a long way to go, but it, it, it is nice to kind of look behind you, um, for a second and say, wow, we did come a far away, but, uh, we, we see the road ahead. And, uh, what's, what's the saying that your, your rear view mirror is smaller than your windshield for a reason, uh, be conscious of what's behind you, but focus on the road ahead. Uh, and I think that that is very true.

I think it's, it's nice to look in the rear view and say, Hey, this was, this was behind this and we we've done this, we've come this far in 93 days. Uh, however, that, that windshield looks, looks pretty appetizing and pretty incredible. So, uh, I'm, I'm very excited for the future.

I couldn't, I couldn't be more excited. Um, and yeah, it's, it's great to have you up here tonight too, because it's kind of, uh, it's kind of bringing it full circle already. Um, and, and it's just, it's awesome to just, to just keep moving forward.

You know?

[Speaker 3]
No, I, I a hundred percent agree with you. I think there's a lot good ahead. You know, I, I've said this before, you know, I think going into this Biden presidency, we all thought in our minds, it's going to be bad, but we didn't think it was going to be this bad.

So I think that the FJB slogan, the motto is going to live on for longer than four years. I think people are, are very pissed this week. I know I am looking at my, uh, crypto and my stock portfolios, uh, and to see how much money that I'm losing because of the vegetable in the white house.

Uh, but you know, I, I'm going to digress, but I will say people are pissed off with this guy. It's not going to end anytime soon. He's going to mess up this year, just like he did last.

We'll see what he's doing with the Ukraine. It's a big FJB moment. I feel unfortunately on the horizon again, uh, with foreign policy.

So we'll see. I think we're going to have quite a long period, quite a long run because this guy keeps messing up. Uh, he's a gaffe machine and I think the American people are waking up.

They're tired of it. They're tired of the systems that we're living in right now. What we've dealt with in the last four years, uh, with unemployment, with wage losses, with job loss all over this vaccine, these mandates that have done nothing, the masks that have done nothing.

So I think that at the end of the day, there's going to be a lot of opportunity here and, uh, I, I have to say people stick around, stick around. There's a lot to come. We are far from done.

Could definitely not have said it better. Just beginning, just beginning a hundred percent.

[Speaker 2]
Very, and also Ryan side note that license plate is, is pretty baller. I saw you at the hashtag FJB, uh, for the M four.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, man. I, I tell you, I was, I was on the highway today and I've got a lot of people giving me thumbs up. I've got no middle fingers yet with that.

[Speaker 2]
So I was going to say, I don't think you'll, you'll ever get pulled over again. I think that you're going to see our people in blue saying, you know what? You're, you're good to go.

[Speaker 3]
Even if you're going 95 on a 17 down there, I mean, after everything that's happened in the last two years and how much we've, we've all put up together, I think we get a little get out of jail free card.

[Speaker 2]
I would think so too. Are also, uh, Eric, I saw, I saw your message. We are inviting him up here to speak.

Uh, and we, we are, we, we sent him an invite up here as well. We're just, we're recruiting everybody up here tonight.

[Speaker 1]
We're having a full, Ben Q is one of my closest friends. He is an incredible journalist, tech journalist. I'm currently at L American, which is, it's, it's the goal.

It's actually, they just raised, uh, uh, just a bunch of money recently and everything, and their goal is to basically bring the conservative message, you know, as Latinos to their fellow Latinos. Um, and Ben is kind of the, the English translation, you know, editor at large over there. And he used to actually work with Bannon at Breitbart as a tech journalist there.

And again, just one of my closest friends. So, um, I saw, I asked him to join and, and, uh, and then, and, and he dragged his butt over here. Can you introduce yourself, Ben?

Or, or I guess maybe I already did.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I can. Um, thanks for the introduction. Yeah.

You failed to mention the fact I'm British, but apart from that, I appreciated the introduction there, um, British originally, but that doesn't mean I, uh, I don't love the concept of FJB and, uh, yeah, no, I think you guys are onto something really, really exciting here. One of the ideas I did here, um, on this call, which I really thought was really exciting, uh, or, or, you know, very interesting and something which I have no doubt they will introduce was that, um, the idea of putting FJB, the option to tip people on getter, um, I actually did a piece on Jason Miller and getter recently trying to work out, you know, what the, what their plans are in the longterm and, you know, how they, how they seek to distinguish themselves. And one of the big things they do plan on doing is, is, is crypto. Um, so I see a real opportunity here, not just for, from getter, but as you say, so many, um, conservative businesses out there, I mean, there's so many more than just, you know, freedom phone and my pillar, there are millions of people across America who, who, um, who would love to get involved with this kind of thing and who share our values.

And it's very important that we support those people and that we're all part of one big economic community because we don't, you know, one of the big problems that conservatives have is that, you know, we give so much money to people we hate, whether it be big tech or whether it be, um, Hollywood or just the big corporations. So, you know, um, I'm really excited by this, by this coin and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with the app. Um, but yeah, my, my philosophy on crypto has always been that basically as well as being a store value, it needs to be there.

Um, it needs to be, uh, uh, easy for merchants to use with transactions that are fast, cheap and reliable. So that's obviously going to be one of the big challenges for FJB, but as long as people can buy it, can sell it and can trade it easily, I think the sky is really the limit for this project.

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely. And, and nice to meet you, Ben. We have not spoken before, uh, but really excited to have you.

[Speaker 4]
You kind of forced me to come on here. I'd be listening to the conversation, but, uh, he kind of co-asked me into, into, into taking an invite. So, uh, here I am.

[Speaker 2]
Well, well, whether it was from, uh, a force from a friend or, or just being up here, uh, we couldn't be happier to have you involved. And, uh, if you're a friend of Eric's, then, uh, then you're a friend of mine and, and we are very excited, uh, just in general.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. And this is of course, one of many, many, um, many things that conservatives are working on. Um, it's so important that the right innovates with this kind of thing.

So, um, you know, whether it be, you know, the new social media websites or whether it be new kinds of business businesses, this is, this is going to be a very important part of that new old tech ecosystem, amazing.

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely. So everybody, uh, we're, we're right around that time now, uh, we're, we're going to start taking questions from you guys, uh, for, for us up here. Um, and, and for Eric, uh, what, what type of questions do we got?

Uh, that, that. Go to the Q and A.

[Speaker 7]
Let's go to the Q and A.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, there's Q and A. It's a great, you know what you guys see, they, they do more than me. You know what I mean?

They make these, they make these channels in here. It's tremendous. Um, questions are in here.

Thank you. Raven. Did Raven do this?

Who, I don't know who did this, but somebody made it. Uh, however we have, you see those questions, uh, Eric.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Yeah. Let me, let me, uh, let me scroll here and be the, I'm just being, being an old man here, even though I'm fairly an issue staying on the app stores will be an issue staying on the app stores.

Um, I don't think so. You know, you look at crypto.com, you look at, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, you look at crypto.com and everything, um, there on, um, you know, you see, you know, you see parlor eventually got back on getters on. And obviously this is the point of freedom phone.

So we'll always be on the freedom phone app store. Um, and then we're going to have a web app as well. So, I mean, that, that, that I think we have multiple backups, which is the web app, freedom phone, and then, uh, the freedom phone app store.

And then too, you know, I, I think it is, we, we have plans on how to be strategic to make sure we're all compliant with app store rules. So we don't even, we don't want to even be testy.

[Speaker 3]
Um, I think also to Eric, one important thing to make is, is I think people are thinking back to when parlor was de-platformed and the important thing here is, yeah, parlor didn't have a moderation process and people said whatever they wanted on the app and Apple didn't like that, that, you know, that, that's not going to be the case here. I don't think, because people aren't going to be able to just, I, if I'm correct, just be able to say anything they want to say on this thing. It's pretty much just a transaction based platform if I'm not mistaken.

Right. So, I mean, this, there shouldn't be any issues with Apple on that.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I don't, I don't, I mean, I don't foresee any issues, um, from that, from that perspective.

Um, but you know, again, we're, we're going to play it super safe at this app store, make sure very, very much in the rules. And then obviously always as a backup, we're going to have the web app and you know, the freedom phone app store, of course. I mean, that's the point of the freedom phone is that you're not reliant on these tyrannical app stores, but that's not the point here.

But again, crypto.com, you've got crypto.com, Coinbase, even a bunch of small startups, um, that, that have similar apps as well. And, you know, we're not going to be really political on this app. This app is meant to be, uh, you know, just a tool for people.

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely. Uh, yeah, I've been seeing that question pop up a bunch. Uh, and I, I knew you would be able to answer that cause you have had experience with app stores and things of that matter.

I, for one have not made an app, uh, and, and, uh, especially one that, that could possibly be, be canceled. Um, but, oh, another great question. Cause we do have a lot of people from overseas.

This one comes from Donnie. Um, will it be usable with UK and European banks, uh, Canadian, et cetera? Because I do know, I wonder what the demographic is, uh, or like the breakdown, but I would think that we have maybe 10 to 20% of people in the coin, uh, from overseas and, and, and they see basically the, I guess, the downfall of, of, of, of the presidency and, and they want to get involved in the coin.

Um, and what happens in America affects everybody.

[Speaker 1]
On this one, it's going to be us only for the app, but, you know, always going to have the goal to be, to be able to have, you know, banking partners and, and other, and other countries. But, you know, in the short term, it's just going to be in the United States, uh, but then, you know, you'll obviously be able to get into it on these, you know, other exchanges that we're currently on, but that's just complicated. Right.

Um, and, uh, uh, uh, you know, yeah. So that, that, that is the point.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. And another question that I've seen, um, is, is how do you ensure that credit card companies don't block transactions? Um, I, I don't, I don't know anything about payment processors.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Eric, Yeah, I mean, we're partnering with a good payment processor for that to make sure that, uh, that, that it doesn't get blocked. So we're not using like Stripe here. Right.

[Speaker 2]
You know, I, I, so yeah, I, I don't really, that's, that's, that's foreign to me. Uh, so it's something new. Do you see any other, any other questions, um, in here, Eric, that we can.

Great idea for the Q&A. I liked that idea actually.

[Speaker 6]
Um, somebody said, will this be an off-ramp to fiat?

[Speaker 5]
An off-ramp to fiat? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So you can withdraw, you know, yeah, that's the point.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, do, do, do, do.

[Speaker 6]
They'll read in, uh, what changes.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Uh, Eric, you, you've commented on, on this. We, we are, we've been speaking about and, um, changes to, to the tax structure.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, changes to the tax structure. Um, I don't think we're going to speak about that today, but just know that that is in our minds. And, uh, we've got, we've got big, big plans for the tokenomics of this coin that I think people really like.

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely. Exactly, exactly, exactly, exactly. Um, somebody said, will the coin remain on the same contract on Binance Smart Chain when the app comes out?

Uh, I think that.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, today is all about just the app. So, um, uh, not tokenomics today. So, um, you know, we're going to keep it focused.

[Speaker 2]
So, yeah. So, so questions, just to shoot questions about the app, about the implications of it, I've, I've seen some other questions about different exchanges and stuff of that matters. Keep it regarding, uh, the app itself.

Um, we said, where will the liquidity go slash be stored on when purchases for FJB are made through the app, another exchange, or will FJB have its own? Question mark.

[Speaker 1]
Um, sorry. Uh, could you repeat that? I just had a, I just had a, you know, furry of tax messages come in.

[Speaker 2]
Of course. Uh, it said, where will, uh, the liquidity go slash be stored when purchases for FJB are made through the app, another exchange, or will FJB have its own?

[Speaker 1]
Um, this will be, uh, uh, we will announce that. I think the whole details of how the app store, everything works and probably more in a long form, uh, blog post. Um, but we're, we're setting up a really good setup that is both, you know, secure and then also make sure that it's, I mean, really secure and, and, uh, uh, uh, and, and really well kind of planned out.

So we want to kind of, I think, detail that more and probably a longer blog, uh, longer blog posts, cause I can give you like a one minute answer here, but like, I think like the point is, is like people want like the more hardcore details of it. But, uh, you shall see, I think you'll really like it. And I think you'll really like that blog post when it comes out.

[Speaker 2]
Exactly. I think a lot of the answers, uh, that we are mentioning here and a lot of the questions that we're seeing, uh, will be answered over the next couple of weeks, um, with, with the new developments of the app itself and, um, basically what we're releasing in it. We, we do really believe that you'll love it.

Um, I know that, uh, we have a tremendous team working on it and I know that, uh, it's going to solve all of the what, so you call them problems or questions that you might have. Uh, people, people are funny that I see. I never used dark mode.

Um, but, uh, people are asking about dark mode on the app. Eric, are you a fan of dark mode? Ryan, do you use dark mode with anything?

Cause I don't think there's one thing that I use dark mode with.

[Speaker 1]
I use dark mode, but probably on this app in the short term, it's just going to have light mode. Um, but you know, I think, I think, I think dark mode is something that's really cool. I like dark, but in the short term, probably it's going to just be light mode for now, because I mean, we couldn't spend a lot of time longer putting in the dark mode, right.

But the point is, is just to get this out as a tool for people because people need it.

[Speaker 2]
So exactly, exactly, exactly.

[Speaker 3]
It's also as if there'd be a website instead of just the app.

[Speaker 1]
If you can go to a website, we're going to have a web app and everything too. Website, iPhone, Android and freedom phone apps.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and the website is definitely going to be a, a tremendous, uh, main focus there.

[Speaker 5]
Exactly, exactly. So it's just going to be super simple for people and you won't need like a Chrome extension or anything.

[Speaker 6]
Perfect. I'm just reading like dark mode, man. I never.

[Speaker 5]
Dark mode. People like the dark mode.

[Speaker 6]
I'm just catching up. I'm catching up. How do them come in at one time?

[Speaker 2]
Some people were saying, what's the timeline for release? Um, I don't think we have a specific timeline, correct, Derek? We're just, uh, updating.

[Speaker 1]
We're we're, we'll let you know, probably like closer to the date, you know, on the timeline and everything. Um, and then, uh, uh, and then, yeah, so I mean, that's, that'll be it there, man. Dark mode is like a popular thing.

I mean, maybe you should delay the app two weeks, you know? No, I'm kidding. But it's, um, uh, uh, uh, that's, that's.

I mean, are people asking, will the app require KYC? Yes. App will require KYC.

This is meant to be as legally compliant. Um, for, for people at like one as for, for, for FJB. But I mean, my goal event, if anything, anyone wants to kind of, uh, uh, uh, do a fee at the crypto on-ramp, I always recommend, you know, just, I mean, not just recommend it, it's needed.

It's must be like legally compliant, um, in the U S. Um, and, uh, and then obviously, you know, I think people can have, people can figure out how to use, you know, kind of their own decentralized wallets on top of that, but in the short term, the goal of this is to be able to get a normal person to be able to use this as a tool for their business where crypto wasn't there, basically their full-time job, um, and everything. So, I mean, uh, that, that, that, that is the point here, right?

Where we just want to make it easy, but obviously we got to do all the legal compliance for that as possible. But I think our legal compliance will be easier than let's say our license, our KYC AML process will be probably easier than Coinbases. Um, I really believe that Coinbase and just makes you, just puts you through a bazillion million hoops that you don't have to jump, jump through legally, like extra ones on top of it.

Um, and you know, you see other, other apps don't, don't go all the way as Coinbase does. Um, but, uh, but yeah, we're going to be completely legally compliant in the U.S. I stress that, um, and, uh, more, probably more than anything. And then, but two at the same time, making it super, super easy for people.

[Speaker 3]
One of the moderators is asking, will app purchases reflect the price on all exchanges?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, sorry, repeat that again. One more time.

[Speaker 3]
It's, uh, from Raven. It says, well, app purchases reflect the price on all exchanges. So I guess if you purchase on the app, will it reflect?

[Speaker 1]
If you purchase the app, uh, yeah, that'll, that'll be tied on, uh, on basically kind of its own kind of rate, which will be, I think, you know, probably one of the best prices out of any of the other exchanges. So that'll be kind of its own, obviously system there. Um, but, uh, but yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it'll, it'll be a good price.

Um, uh, we'll have, you know, yeah, it'll be a really good, you know, kind of normal, normal rate, probably lower than probably what other people's are.

[Speaker 2]
Right. And I'm right now it works, Eric. We spoke about this one as well as, uh, uh, any other, do you plan on any other crypto is being supported on the app?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, absolutely. We're going to have Bitcoin and Ethereum, um, at least, um, and I think maybe Dogecoin, maybe, uh, uh, TUSB, um, to have like a stable coin in there. Um, but yeah, I mean, that's, we absolutely, at least Bitcoin and at least Ethereum.

So we want to be able to have you not just go, you know, like, uh, just FJB be biased, but we want this to be like, you know, again, 75 million plus people to be able to get into crypto. And I think Bitcoin is, you know, that's, that's how I made my money originally. Right.

Um, I like Bitcoin. Um, but, uh, but yeah, I mean, giving many, many people options, um, FJB obviously being our favorite.

[Speaker 2]
And I think that's a, that's a really great point is, is like bringing a lot of people to crypto that haven't done it before, because I know that there's, there's some people out there that spent a day or two, uh, and, and they message and say, Hey, FJB is my first and only crypto coin that I own. Um, and there's, like you said, 74 million plus, uh, American patriots that, that voted for Donald Trump in 2020. And I don't know what the demographic is and what the breakup of that is and saying, Hey, this amount of those voters own crypto, but, uh, I'm sure that if.

When this app does come out that they're going to say, Hey, I want to get FJB. And then the more they play around with the app, the more they learn about it and they can say, Hey, I'm also interested in Bitcoin. I'm also interested in Ethereum and so on and so forth.

It's going to be a marketplace for all of that. And like you said, FJB is, is absolutely our favorite, um, and the purpose of the app, but, uh, it's, it's just going to be a great, uh, marketplace for Bitcoin and Ethereum and whatever else, uh, is going to be there as well. So people that might not have ever gotten to crypto, uh, have a chance to get in as well, the easiest way possible, because let's face it, even, even Coinbase is, is difficult.

Uh, you get Coinbase, you give Coinbase to some people, they still can't figure it out. I don't, I think the setup is, is really not even that, that, that clear. Um, I don't think that it's, it's that intuitive, you know, and, and we've seen that, uh, we've heard a lot of people's complaints, um, and it's going to be, like I said, easier than buying toilet paper on Amazon.

[Speaker 1]
These days, toilet paper, even at a, at a grocery store. I mean, you know, I mean, it's crazy. I mean, you look at the, I've been going into grocery stores.

A lot of the frozen food is all gone just because of, you know, truckers, the whole trucking situation, right? They can't keep the frozen long enough because they don't have that. Anyways, it's interesting, um, what's going on there, um, in many ways.

Uh, but, uh, but yeah, I mean, I, I really see FJB coin as a way to be able to be an entry point for normal people to get into, you know, DeFi. I mean, I really, I really believe that. I mean, just, it's just such an untapped market because, um, basically, you know, if you, if you go the conservative route, you know, you get nailed for it.

Right. I mean, and then that's why you get a lot of talented crypto people are too afraid to do that. They're like, oh, we don't care about politics.

We're just, you know, vaguely libertarian, you know, just believe in a decentralized future. But let that's, but that's the thing is they're just, there's just these forgotten group of people that have heard about crypto, want to get into crypto. They see the use case of it.

Um, and as, especially with my pillow getting banned, um, and Trump getting banned from so many banks and Flynn getting banned from chase, uh, and everything, I mean, you know, they see the use case of it, they've heard of crypto, but it's just, they don't know, you know, I mean, I personally think that we will be seen as like on, on the, on that you said grant the, I'm on the, I'm on the head of the Mount Rushmore of crypto.

I actually, you know, maybe so, but I think, I think that FJB coin is going to be a literal statue of liberty. Um, in the crypto space, because we're going to be bringing 75 million people that have probably never touched crypto before, I really believe we'll get that 75 million. It's a belief.

It's a biased belief is an opinion, but it is, I think our goal. And I think it's an achievable goal to be able to get those 75 million plus people to get into defy and think about the ramifications that we'll have for the country and think about what the ramifications that we'll have in expanding the crypto market. I mean, I, I really, I just, I just, this is why I joined this.

And I think this is why it's, uh, because basically, no, I had a nice, I had a nice, you know, left wing media image, um, and everything being, you know, the youngest Bitcoin millionaire. And I remember, I think it was Ann Coulter told me, she was like, uh, she was like, why, why do you want to be, you know, uh, why do you want to, uh, and she's, she's wicked smart. She was like, why do you want to get into, she's like, I love conservative stuff, I chose that route, but she's like, you have such a night, you should play the game, Eric, you know, going out conservative people fight you and obviously I can take it, but you know, just, just why, why make your life hard?

I mean, it's, uh, you, you are, it is, it is, it is, uh, uh, if you have such a nice brand, you know, why, why would you go and take that risk for yourself? She's like, I admire it. I respect it.

That's what I chose to do. But you know, why would you do that? Right.

Cause you know, freedom phone, you Google that without people like faked reviewed that project. Right. And I was like, well, conservative values like really matter to me.

And I think I'm one of the, probably the only crypto person that will take like this much of a public, you know, stance being a full Trump supporter, going full manga. And, and I think that gives me, you know, Peter Thiel go where you can have a monopoly. I think I can, you know, bring 75 million people to get away from Apple to get away from, uh, uh, like Google phones, like pixels or anything.

I think, I think I, and with grant and with everybody, um, really, really probably more so grant than me, but I want to help, you know, grant and, and Bannon and Boris, you know, bring in those 75 million people into crypto. I mean, I, it just, it would just be such a game changing thing to have 75 million normal people get into cryptocurrency. I don't think, I don't think anyone, there's actually 75 million like individuals.

I think Bitcoin has like a hundred million wallets, but like, you know, you can have multiple wallets. I don't think any project would have 75 million individuals. And I think that is actually, you know, obviously a goal, but is achievable for us.

And that's, and that's why I want to get into this. But again, you get, you get bonked for it because, uh, you're like, Oh, well, you know, the media doesn't like Trump. So anyone who supports kind of that cause vaguely will, uh, will, uh, uh, you know, they'll bonk you for it and everything, but who cares because you're actually bringing, you know, actual good technology, good tools to the, to the entire country, to 75 million people.

I mean, this, that's why I jumped at this of, of wanting to be involved. And it says a little bit.

[Speaker 2]
No, no. And, and I, I love that part about, um, just about this coin being historic and, and about what we're trying to do, because I, I see this coin in like 30 years when they're making textbooks, whatever, I don't know when they make textbooks, but when they do, uh, covering it in us history and I'm, and I'm sure there's going to be old decentralized currency section talking about cryptocurrencies, uh, the bit, like, you know, how they covered the gold rush. They're going to talk about the Bitcoin rush and things like that. I am so certain that they're going to have FJB there as like one of the most historic coins and like what it did and whether it's, whether they phrase it, uh, that it was good or they try to cancel us and be like a left-wing textbook, um, and say like, blah, blah, blah.

They made a coin about F Joe Biden, the whole nine yards. But I just, I just, there's no way that I don't see this coin being one of, if not the most influential coins, uh, in the world that when people think of coins, they think of Bitcoin, they think of Ethereum and they think of FJB. And, and I, I, I really don't see it any other way.

I I've thought that from day one, and I will think that every single day, uh, on this project, because I'm so confident in, and I'm, when people talk about the Mount Rushmore of things, they talk about the Mount Rushmore of cryptocurrencies, I am so confident that they're going to see that Eagle, uh, with the aviators up there, uh, as, as, as one of them.

[Speaker 1]
I agree. I mean, I, I really do believe, I mean, I, I, I think you look in the history books about crypto, like you said, 30 years from now, they're going to be like, Oh, this, you know, look at this Bitcoin did this, you know, even Litecoin is kind of in there and say Dogecoin, Ethereum. And then you look at FJB brought 75 million normal people into DeFi and got them into decentralization.

I mean, I think that's, it's, it's massive. I mean, I really, I really do. And I'm just excited to be supportive of this.

[Speaker 2]
Anyways, um, I think, I think, yeah, we can get, we can get back to some questions. I think, uh, a lot of these questions that we're seeing that I'm reading to, as, as we're talking, uh, will be answered over the next couple of weeks with, with the developments of it. Uh, one of them is, will the app have its own trading pair or still BNB or individual?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, I mean, you'll, you'll be able to go from, you know, USD, not even a stable coin, USD to, uh, uh, to FJB. And then, yeah, you'll also be able to go from FJB to Bitcoin, you know, it's, and, and anything else. I mean, it's pretty cool.

[Speaker 2]
Definitely. Yeah. That's, that's the, the most important part about it is just is, is ease of use, because if you have to buy a BNB and jump through hoops like you currently are, that's the, the barrier to entry.

And that's why so many, and I'm convinced that there's maybe hundreds of thousands of people out there that have tried to buy FJB that just can't. Um, and, and it's this, the, it's very hard. It's, it's not easy, but when you can go there and use a credit or debit card or use a bank and just buy FJB right from the app and just take two seconds and put in your information, like you're checking out and buying sunglasses online, anybody can do, anybody can buy the coin, you know?

And so you don't have to have a trading pair. You don't have to do that. It's just, it's going to be tremendously easy to buy.

[Speaker 1]
And, uh, I, I see a lot of these questions, anything that you want to take, Eric, uh, and I'm looking at, I apologize because I'm going to have to ignore some of these because there's just, it's going to be future stuff that we're going to add, you know, everything later. So, I mean, I don't, uh, I don't want to get into these. So, uh, some of these, so if I didn't answer your question, I either didn't see it or, um, it's just going to be talked about later.

So, um, uh, do I have to hold up my ID and a piece of paper with my name, birthday and bizarre ID so that someone in Hong Kong could decide if I am who I say I am? Um, no, no, you won't have to hold up something. Uh, you'll have to scan your ID, but you won't have to hold up a piece of paper with your name, birthday and everything.

Um, and, and yeah, the, the, the KYC and AML people are not in Hong Kong. So you're all good. Yeah.

That one made me crack up a little bit.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that was funny. Um, well, um, yeah, I mean, people really want dark mode apparently, so we could have to keep, people will stand on a pedestal on that one.

[Speaker 2]
I didn't, I didn't think it was that important to some people.

[Speaker 1]
No, we'll have to add then the product roadmap then. Um, let's see here. Uh, okay.

I mean, I think, I think this is, uh, uh, I think this is cool. Someone said, uh, can I'll hear, I'll answer this last question. This last question.

Um, can you make a commitment to weekly update Q and a fin keep the momentum up? Yes, I will. I will be doing this every week.

So, um, be back on next week to everybody. And, uh, this is, uh, this is great. Actually, I will take one more question.

Will my 74 year old boomer dad be able to use this app? Yes, that is the goal. The goal is to make it as accessible for, for normal people to use it as a tool, whether you're, you're, you're 18 or you're, you're, you're 80.

So, um, I think that that is, that is, I liked that question and we're going to finish, finish that off. Some of these questions are funny. Um, and everything.

So anyways, thank you everybody. Thank you for hopping on. Um, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna hang up here.

I don't know, Grant, if you want to finish it out, but thank you so much for your time. This has been a great Q and a, I hope you all liked the mock-ups. I hope you liked everything.

Um, uh, yes, crock. I did see your question. That was the question I was laughing at.

I don't know why that's making me laugh so much, but thank you everybody. Thank you everybody. Have a good one.

Grant, finish it out.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you guys all for joining. Huge shout out to Eric. Uh, you are the man we love having you here.

Uh, it's always like a fountain of knowledge to have him up here. Uh, and, and like, I, there's people in here that don't really understand how incredible it is that he's, he's a part of the team as a senior strategic advisor, because he, like I said, he's, he's on the Mount Rushmore of crypto. He's one of the most popular people in crypto history and he's in our project and he's part, uh, leading the charge, you know, and he's a senior strategic advisor giving fantastic advice and, and paving the way.

And, uh, it's, it's really amazing. Again, thank you guys all here coming right up on the hour. I love these talks when, when we can really get into it, uh, answer some questions, have some fun and provide some good, uh, knowledge to you guys and feedback on, on what's going on.

But, uh, thank you guys all. Uh, we will be in here. Don't worry.

I'm here 24 seven. Uh, we are still moving forward. I am even more excited today than I ever been with the project.

And that's saying something because my excitement never wavers. Um, we will be doing another voice on a preliminary for Thursday. We'll get you more information, um, with, with two more special guests.

So excited. Can't wait. You guys are incredible.

Keep doing you keep shilling. Love you guys. Eat a Frank.

Good night.
