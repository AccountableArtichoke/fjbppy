[Speaker 1]
Got the recording going. All right, I hope everybody's had a great week so far. I know it was a little bit of a wild weekend.

It's been a sad day for me. My favorite dog passed last year, I think like yesterday or today, so it's not been fun. I'm trying to pull up my notes that disappeared.

Yeah, so we had a wild weekend in FJB World. I think it was Sunday, possibly. Let me see.

That's weird. My text...oh no, there it is. Friday, actually, that Boris said he noticed the coin rising and he wanted to know what led to that.

So, he was very happy about that. Now, while we're on that, I just want to reiterate the whole tax issue, guys. I know we had surfer dude upset because we were not able to refund him taxes.

Again, very sorry about that, but we can't refund your taxes when you transfer wallets, when you accidentally sell, when you get, you know, scammed out of your coins, which is why I try to remind you again and again just to make sure your funds are safe. You know, sometimes users are worried if their funds in Smart Wallet and I try to reassure all of you that your funds are safe. You do have custody of your funds in the app.

We do not have custody of your funds. Nobody else does unless they have your keys. So, just keep that in mind because we cannot refund you your taxes.

That's not...I get that question asked at least once a week by someone. So, if we refund one person, you know how it's gonna go. So, we absolutely cannot do that.

We can't do it under the table. We can't do it if you won't tell anybody. Really sorry.

That's just the way it is. It's not up to me. Just keep that in mind before transferring your funds or, you know, accidentally selling your funds or try not to get scammed either.

Just be very wary of that because we can't under any condition refund you the taxes. I'm really, really, really sorry about that and hopefully you guys understand. It's not that we don't want to help you or it's not that we don't feel absolutely awful you got scammed but we can't.

Again, if we refund one person's taxes, we're gonna have to refund everybody else's. No special cases. So, getting that out of the way, the chart still looks nice with that cell.

I think pretty solid ground. So, that's great. We've officially hired a blockchain advisor analyst.

Probably a senior blockchain advisor analyst and I'm absolutely stoked. Very, very happy about that. I have a feeling we'll be hiring a few more people by the time we go live which is absolutely amazing.

Just trying to get everything organized and ready hopefully for more volume and to grow the community. As far as testing goes, a few the team hasn't found bugs. It's just a few functions that need to be tweaked or have some additions to them.

So, that's being worked on. Also, in the meantime, the dev is getting set up to work on the app. That way, in the meantime, while the team is reviewing his code and everything, he can just start reviewing the app and kind of get comfortable with it before he starts work.

So, very happy about that and very happy about just all the features. Like I've said before, they're so, so cool. And even the every detail, even the few things they are tweaking, I'm really excited for you all to see.

Just getting super antsy about that. I can't wait to see your reactions. So, I think that is all the updates I have for you.

Oh, and our logo. I was like, I'm forgetting something. Where did you find the blockchain advisor?

It's somebody recommended by the team. An absolute genius. And I am stoked about that.

I think we're absolutely honored that he let me see. I want to make sure I get either wrong or the right. Trying to find the logo.

But yeah, absolutely honored that he is willing to work with us. Super, super excited about that. Let me see.

Drop the new logo. Hopefully you all like it. Telegram.

I upgraded my subscription to Telegram, but still glitching on me. I don't know if anybody else's is still bugging out. Same when I send messages still.

Okay. Can you all see that? Or do I need to give you another form too?

I'll include another form just in case. Some of you might not be able. Okay.

That one might work better for most of you. I was going to upgrade to Telegram premium today, but then I remembered I'm FJB poor. Hopefully won't be for much longer.

Oh, Transac has not gotten back on you guys' accounts yet. The list of accounts I've sent. Again, if you are, I saw a few more people in the chats that seemed with disabled accounts.

Please send me your email if you do want that account enabled again so they can go ahead and take care of you. That's weird. It's cut off in the middle.

That's weird. What do you mean? Sent it in two forms.

Has anybody else's cut off in the middle? Looks fine on my end. Yep, that's in.

Awesome. Cool. That's weird.

Why didn't it work with that file? Cool. I'm glad you guys like it.

The wings are the P's, the Patriot pay, two P's front and back. Got the eagle head going on with a star and then of course the Patriot pay. I think it's really cool.

Clean, modern, and then definitely I think it says freedom but it's not just unique to the U.S. Tried to make it a little bit more global. So is the secret task you all were working on was paying someone from Coingecko to not update charts so we could take advantage of those sweep prices? No, that's not the case.

Our chart on Coingecko should be updated. They got back to us and updated that. I'm super excited about that.

I love the logo. Hopefully you all do too. I think it'll be nice and modern and clean.

With the tax wallet selling, are you guys satisfied? How are we looking financially moving forward? So we actually are just getting quotes from different marketing, I don't know, deals I guess.

So we'll update you on that but I think this weekend was great for us. Definitely, obviously the more funds we have to work with, the more opportunities we have. Everything's super expensive especially in the crypto space.

I know before it was, you know, shoving 10, 20k out at a time. So we'll definitely make sure that those funds are very basically just well used. Will native app coin change from FJB to PP?

Are you talking the native app? Are you talking about the coin? Are you talking about the FJB app?

Yeah, FJB coin has to stay as FJB coin until we fork. There's no other way for us to change that, unfortunately. Oh, by the way, if you're someone who's emailing me regarding moving your funds off XT, feel free to message me on here too because I haven't heard back from you.

It's been a few hours. So yeah, definitely get back to me. You can contact me on here too and that way I can help you get your funds off XT.

I know whoever it was was saying that Trust Wallet didn't support FJB token so I imagine it's nobody in here but just in case. Yeah, once we eventually do fork, we'll be changing the Let's Go Brandon. So the main team is still reviewing the dev's work and code?

Yes, and so far there are no bugs but there are two changes, tweaks kind of, two little details. So far, super, super excited. I absolutely can't wait to see more, to see your reactions.

What about paid boosting ads on Facebook? Facebook will not allow any crypto ads now. That's not to say they won't allow us to market the merchandise.

So that will be, we'll be changing the FJB store to Patriot Pay, have new merch and we can always put that on there. But as far as crypto, anything crypto related, they will not do that. Can you leave Let's Go Brandon somewhere in the code so if anyone ever breaks into the code they get a laugh before they drain all the liquidity?

Oh gosh, why would you ever say a thing? Oh actually, let me pin that before I lose track of it. Yeah, why would you ever say a thing?

Um, I think there'll be something better in the code for you all to find though. I'm still, I'm gonna make bets on who finds it first though. Something tells me it'll be the robot.

So I feel like he shouldn't count, like I think that's what's gonna happen, is since I think the robot will catch it, then yeah, I think that's a good idea. Then he doesn't count, he gets a prize automatically, well not automatically if he doesn't figure it out, but there has to be somebody else too. So we have to have two prizes because, I mean, who can compete with a robot?

Yeah, Russ says Nolan, exactly. That's like, can't, we're all, we're all humans and then there's a robot so we have to have two prizes. But I am curious to who will actually break it.

Maybe P6, but I don't, I know P6 doesn't really come in here much, so that would have been my second guess. Um, yeah, I don't know. I'm trying to figure out who's, who's a crypto or coding expert.

I'm not sure, you guys probably know better than I do now. All right, I think that's everything. I don't see anything in my DMs. Do you guys have a timeline for when the third parties get the go-ahead?

I don't, so we still have two, what, let me see, two weeks in August. We should be, we should be still good to go. Um, yeah, as long as everything still goes the way it has been.

Of course, if the team finds bugs, then that will take a bit more time, but I'll definitely keep you updated if that happens. So far, no bugs. Is it in the smart contracts?

No, because we can't change those until fork, but it will be in the new code that you all will see. So, trying to figure out who's really, who else is really into crypto. I know there's a few software developers.

Um, I don't know if there's any blockchain devs in here, otherwise they'd be helping us, I think. Weg. Weg, yeah, right.

That's, that's funny. So, next step, uh, so next step, we, like I said, I have the team reviewing right now. Um, as soon as that's over, we'll have some of you probably test it.

To see if, uh, you know, everything goes well there. In the meantime, like I said, dev's reviewing the app just to get comfortable with it. He specializes, actually, in that stack.

So, that's perfect. Uh, timeline hasn't changed so far. We're still looking good by the end of the month right now.

If that changes, I will keep you updated. I'll definitely keep you updated. Again, if they do find, uh, bugs, you know, that's gonna take, of course, more time.

Um, you know, we know we can release this. And with these, like, I love the features. I love every detail of the features, and I'm sure you all will too.

We know we could release this, you know, this week. And everything go crazy, everyone go nuts, and we, you know, get what we want. The charts where they are and grow in the community, but then we're kind of screwed.

Um, if bugs come up, and of course with higher volume, we're gonna notice the bugs a lot quicker than we are just with testing. Um, so that is why the team is making sure to be super thorough. They want, you know, like we have for the past few months.

I know it's frustrating to keep waiting, but it really is so many features. Um, again, features you all will love, but they want to make sure everything is as the best it can be. And if there are bugs or anything like that, we want to make sure that we do catch them, um, so that we don't go live.

And then we have to go back to the dev working again and doing everything all over, which is going to cost a ton of money, especially with third parties involved, and just be an overall headache. So hopefully that you guys understand the delay in that. And I think, I think once you see all the features, truly the very, very, very long list of features, I think you all will understand what the heck took so dang long.

Will this require an app update? This is not going to require any update from you guys on your end. As of right now.

Steve's case is asking to throw him. Of course they are. Look at what's, uh, happening to Trump.

Insane. It's, um, crazy. It's really so crazy.

But, you know, we want to make sure we get it right. In the meantime, um, thank you guys. The marketing wallet this weekend, I think everything went great there.

And again, that's only going to help us. Um, actually it worked out really well. We had just hired our guy.

So that's amazing. Obviously the more funds we have coming in to the marketing wallet with the volume, the, uh, better, more high quality people we can hire, which is amazing. Oh, Russ will do his time.

Yeah, they're nuts. Crazy. Awful, awful what's happening.

But I think, um, that, that gives us even more room to, uh, help people and to serve even a much more needed purpose. Um, what did I miss? Um, I pinned the new logo, but I am recording.

Other than that, what did you miss? Uh, I can go down the list. You missed Boris asking about the chart and why we were doing so well.

Uh, he sent that on Friday. He's very happy about that. Um, taxes, we cannot refund any taxes if you get scammed or if you accidentally sell or accidentally transfer.

Sorry. Very, very sorry about that. Um, just because we, we really have at least one person a week ask guys, and if we do it for you, you know, we can't do it under the table.

We can't do it without anybody knowing. Um, and then we've officially hired a senior blockchain advisor analyst, super brilliant guy that I think will be amazing for us. Super stoked about that.

Not thin. And then, um, as far as testing goes, there's been, uh, not, no bugs found yet, actually. Um, just a few tweaks.

So far, two tweaks that need to be tweaks or additions. Um, and they're very, very cool. Oh, you're quick.

Nice. I love it.

[Speaker 2]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Um, oh, also, well, it's probably not you, but if you're the person emailing me about getting your coins off XT, feel free to message me on here too. Whoever it is, I think, doesn't get to their email much.

Uh, but Trust Wallet definitely supports, uh, FJB token. Feel free to message me on here if you're the person emailing me too. Yeah.

Somebody made a FJB coin order a few days ago. That was pretty nice. Uh, oh, somebody asked about the Facebook ads to crypto.

They won't do crypto ads, but we can definitely do merch ads. So as long as, as far, or as soon as the merch is, uh, switched over to PatriotPay, then, uh, yeah, we'll go ahead and do that. We can always do that.

I'm not sure how well we do on Facebook. Probably better on Getter, but you never know. Well, I think that's everything.

Uh, please, please, please do not, um, try to fix the app yourself and make transactions, especially with large amounts. Um, please do that at your own risk. Um, and definitely don't give other people that advice.

We are not able, again, to return any, uh, taxes that result from that. Um, we're not, we also can't reimburse you for coins that are lost through that. Um, if your coins are in the wallet, they are there.

They are safe. They, nobody else has custody of your coins but you. Um, so keep that in mind.

Don't worry about that. Again, the dev will start on that. Um, you know, don't, uh, hold on.

Sorry. So, yeah, uh, just please keep that in mind. Please don't share your seed phrase or click on any weird links or send any admins money.

It's likely not us. Uh, just be very, very careful. I'd hate for that to happen, especially right now.

Um, so, yeah. Go ahead and, uh, as far as the dev, he's actually just started reviewing the code, so that's, um, yeah. He's, uh, checking that out and getting comfortable with it while the team finishes reviewing.

So, oh yeah, I so want, trust me, it is, I'm really excited for everybody's reaction of every little detail. Um, I really am. I think you all will be, uh, very, very happy, in my opinion.

And if you're not, I'm just gonna kick you out because how can you not be? Uh, yeah. Yes, I do have it on mute because otherwise I have, um, that's probably why I didn't hear you.

Because otherwise all my alerts are going crazy with, like, DMs and Discord and Telegram and the emails. I need to go through Discord messages. I think I have, like, oh, I don't know how many hundreds on there.

But, oh, if you have messaged me and I haven't responded, please message me again so it goes to the top of my box. Um, it's even worse on Telegram because Telegram, like, archives them for whatever reason. Or a lot of them, anyway.

At least Discord rarely ever filters them out. Uh, okay. They'll be back.

All right. Well, uh, tag me or DM me if you need anything else. I will update you if we do find any bugs or, uh, if we need to move the timeline up.

Again, right now we still have a solid two weeks, um, so we're looking good. Um, but again, I will update you. Uh, that, the team's goal has not changed where their main goal is getting a, getting it right, um, versus the timeline.

So, again, I appreciate you guys' patience. Um, trust me, I want nothing more than to share everything with you all. Um, but I think it'll be well, well worth it.

I think even the team kind of, not forgot, but, um, didn't realize just how many features, uh, we added just because it happened little by little. And then just seeing the list all at once and testing everything all at once, it's like, holy shh, that's a lot of features. Um, so I think it'll be worth the wait, uh, to get it done right.

Uh, we can go ahead and get it released prematurely, but, uh, we just have to go back and pay again and wait for third parties again and do all that. So, um, you know, that'll, that'll be great to give us the highest, uh, chance of success and, uh, growing the community. Um, all right.

That's a good one, actually. I think, I want to say PatriotPaycoin is already taken. I'm not sure.

Um, okay. Oh, well, you have a wonderful night. Uh, I hope you like the logo.

I think it's, uh, a lot cleaner and we didn't rip it off another app, so that'll be nice. Um, Sarah, can you start over? Princess Ed just entered the building.

Hey, I recorded it and then I repeated everything for who was it? Went down the cliff notes for Voodoo Child. All right.

Well, thanks. All right, guys. You guys have a wonderful night.

I'll see you in gen. I will upload the files right now along with the cliff notes. And I will update you before Friday if I have any updates, otherwise we'll just plan on being in Discord on Friday.
