Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, what's going on, everybody? How are we doing? Happy Sunday night.

You guys hear me? All right. Let's see it.

Yep. Yep. Yep.

I'm seeing a bunch of yes.

[Speaker 1]
A bunch of yeses coming on from the crowd. How we doing? How's everybody feeling?

Great. Great. Great.

Great. Great. What's going on?

Just finished up the Bucks-Rams game. Sorry for the delay on this voice chat. Just wanted to come in here quick.

We had 118 people already. I'm probably expecting a little bit more coming in on this Sunday night. Just wanted to check in quickly, give you a quick overview of what's going on, and give you some hints as to what's coming in the future.

But Sunday night, as you guys know, I like to come up here and kind of just give the rundown of what's been working on. We've been working on behind the scenes a lot of different things. As you guys saw yesterday, the NFTs went live for FJB holders.

You could pick those up. There was the airdrop. You can claim yours.

I saw you guys grabbing a bunch of those, which is absolutely awesome. Those NFTs look fantastic. I'm trying to sneak up on them.

I don't know who does that, but people are trying to sneak up on the little voice, whatever.

[Speaker 2]
It happens. However... Sorry, I'm drinking water.

[Speaker 1]
However, I saw that that was awesome that people were able to get their NFTs. Those things look beautiful. I saw some really unique ones.

It's really incredible that we're in this position to be partnered up with McNifty Art, because I just saw how great they looked. Exactly. I'm seeing some of them being posted right now, and they look absolutely awesome.

For us to be in partnership with them is sick. Keep pushing those, because that's really incredible. I know that people love that.

The community loves that. Yeah, those NFTs are absolutely great. And other news.

Other news. What else do we have? Today is Sunday.

You guys know what tomorrow is. Tomorrow is Monday. If you remember the voice call with Eric Finman last week, we have some exciting news coming tomorrow.

Correct? Tomorrow is Monday, January 24th. There will be some exciting news.

I will get you an official time when I do have that, but it should be on War Room. That's coming tomorrow, Monday, January 24th, directly from Eric Finman himself, the world's youngest Bitcoin millionaire, who is a senior strategic advisor on our team for FJB. He is releasing this news.

It's going to be absolutely incredible. I am so beyond excited. And yeah, there's really not much else to say.

But if I were you guys, I would be very excited to be able to be a part of something this young and this amazing and this incredible. We've never let you down. We never have.

And I know I keep saying that, but the project is only 90 days old. And for how much we've done in these past three months, it's just been absurd, especially even in the crypto world, how many accomplishments that we've had. But this news and every single news from here on out is only getting bigger.

It's only going upwards. And we are never stopping this train. We are never letting our foot off the gas.

We are only pushing forward. We are only pushing higher. We are only we're climbing a mountain and they're looking for the next highest mountain to climb.

We're moving forward every single day with whatever we're doing. We are moving forward. We are working our butts off to make sure that this thing is the easiest, the most successful and most successful crypto project that it can be.

We are really working. Absolutely. You guys have seen it.

You guys have seen how well everything has been. I know it's just a Sunday night. I actually have to check the price of the coin recently in the past couple of days because frankly, I'm not worried and it has no effect on what's going on because I'm so excited for the news.

I'm so excited for you guys to see what's going on and I'm so excited for you guys to be clued in. And yeah, this thing is going to be absolutely awesome. Just know that this thing is going to be awesome.

We keep coming out with this tremendous news. Just think a week ago is when we announced Eric Finman and in that short period of time he came on Discord Voice, kind of gave you the whole rundown of his plan, his vision. And if anybody knows crypto, it's Eric Finman.

He is basically a young person, but a veteran in this game. He's been involved in the crypto space for over a decade. And yeah, exactly.

All of crypto is getting killed. If you look at Bitcoin, Bitcoin is like, I think 36, correct? Literally just a few months ago, it was in the 60s.

So it happens. That's what crypto is. If you don't want to experience something like that, then nobody's forcing you to be here.

Nobody's forcing you to be in crypto. You kind of knew what you were signing up for. It is crypto.

However, we have the perfect person and the perfect team, aka Eric Finman, to steer the ship in the right direction. And I just love watching it. I love watching from the sidelines.

I love seeing this community continue to push forward because I want you guys to reap the fruits of the labor that you guys have all put in. Think back to all the times that we have been trending on StockTwits or all the times that you guys were pushing an Instagram post or all the times that you guys were making TikTok videos, like all these little things, it all adds up and all pushes us forward. It all keeps this coin going in this community going.

I really do believe that tomorrow you guys are going to understand the vision completely and everything is going to be connected. All the dots are going to be connected. And from here on out, you guys are going to see the vision.

And I really do think that you guys do. You guys wouldn't be here on a Sunday night listening to a voice session if you didn't. But I just want the world to know because, yeah, we know.

But what good is it if only we know? We just got to keep pushing the word, keep pushing it out there so that everybody else sees.

[Speaker 2]
All that I wanted to say tonight, I wanted to keep it. I will let you guys know exactly what time this thing is going live, what time you guys are finding out.

[Speaker 1]
But I am extremely excited, extremely, extremely excited. I keep saying that. I've been saying that so much recently, but it's true because it's only been exciting news recently.

It's only been huge things. We just announced Eric Freeman last week. That was huge.

That was absolutely huge. And you just laid out a whole step-by-step plan of what he sees this coin doing. And reiterating the fact that this is not a meme coin.

And for this to only be a week, that was, in my mind, that was day one. That was a new chapter. That was a new day one to the coin.

And we are just getting started. So think of this just being the first week and tomorrow being another huge milestone along this journey. I can't wait.

You guys should be very pumped up. And yeah, I will probably be hitting on another voice tomorrow. So you guys will be hearing from me.

I'm going to be in the Discord and the Telegram a lot more now. I was feeling a little bit under the weather, but now I'm back. And yeah, let's make this week a great week.

And I can't wait to talk to you guys again soon. Let's do this thing. Do I like the bills or cheaps?

I want the bills to win. I think the bills deserve it. I just saw that to rock.

But I think it's going to be a great game tonight. Just wrapped up a really great game. But everybody, have a great night.

Monday is going to be awesome. This week is going to be absolutely awesome. Let's do this thing.

Have a great night. Be safe, everybody.

[Speaker 2]
And I'll talk soon.
