[Speaker 2]
Hello, everybody. Thank you for tuning in on a slightly earlier than usual voice call. Usually I do 10 p.m. I am excited to speak with you. I'm just waiting for people to come in. I'm excited to speak with everybody. We got some exciting news.

We got some exciting news. Right now I'm just looking in the mirror.

[Speaker 1]
Having a good hair day today, if anyone's curious. Make sure to... You should actually...

hair is one of the most... it's a great symbolizer of your health. It truly is.

So I would recommend everybody to take care of their hair.

[Speaker 2]
Take care of their health. Look in the mirror. Smile.

Look good. I'm just making small talk. I'm waiting for everybody to come in.

How has been the Discord chat? Usually we do these on Monday. So I appreciate people coming in on a Wednesday.

Beautiful Wednesday evening. I hope it's as nice where you are as it is here. 105 at 905.

I'll kick it off. 905 in one minute. Tell your friends.

Tell your family. Tell your children. Tell your parents.

Come on this voice call because it's an amazing voice call. Discord is really great. I remember when everyone used to do all of these on Slack.

[Speaker 1]
Like Slack was the kind of main group chat.

[Speaker 2]
That mass scalable group chat that everybody used. So it is 905. I'm actually going to pull up the general chat.

So when everybody has their questions. So when you have questions I can see.

[Speaker 1]
Oh dude I'm looking at... I'll get started after I mention one thing. I see Turek in the chat has some pretty freaking amazing hair.

So shout out to him.

[Speaker 2]
Incredible hair. Love the hair. So anyways.

[Speaker 1]
Today I'm giving State of the Union a State of FJB coin. So as many of you saw. We got the Android app out just the other day.

Which is amazing. On the Play Store everywhere. Just got a search for it.

And with time as more people. As one just the developer process. They told us this.

And then also two. You know as people leave reviews. It's going to show up.

And more search results for more keywords. So the Android app is incredible. I mean that puts us in front of.

You know tens of millions of people. Well I guess people can search for it. The marketing afterwards.

Is going to actually put us directly. In front of tens of millions of people. But we're just waiting on the iOS app.

To leave the test flight process. We're just working out a couple bugs. A couple kinks.

And then waiting for Apple to push us live. But getting to the test flight process. Was a tremendous achievement.

So we're on iOS on test flight. Soon to be the main iOS app store. Then you know we're on the Play Store everywhere.

Big news. We just got approved by this API. Which will allow even easier.

Buy and sell. Much easier. Easier for people of all ages.

As long as they're legally allowed. You know to buy crypto. People of all ages.

To easily buy and sell crypto. And this is a place that. You know will.

Respects our values. Respects our beliefs. Unlike the last one that we used.

Which was kind of a bummer. But again we just got approved on that. We are in the process of integrating that.

As soon as possible. I don't think it'll take too long at all. We're in iOS on test flight.

About to be live on the app store. We're just testing. Continuing to test that out.

Please leave us your feedback. In the Discord. We're on the Google Play Store now.

I mean people said. You know you're not going to be able to have an app. You can't do it.

This is you know. This takes companies. Millions of dollars.

And many years of time. To do it. You saw you know.

Crypto.com. That was the case. You saw you know.

Many of these apps. You know Libra. Even took you know.

Years. To pull something together. Like this is what we've done.

And the developers that we have. And I'm chatting with them. Almost every day.

You know to push this live. So it's in a place where I can just take it. And move it.

And we were there. You know. When we used.

When we used Wire. But then Wire did not share our values. Is the nice way to put it.

So I was just about to kick off all the marketing. I was setting up interviews. I actually had to cancel some of these interviews.

Because again. These audiences. Are the 75 plus million people.

Who share our values. Who voted for Trump. You know.

So I had all these interviews scheduled. I had to cancel them. Because the goal is.

And you might say. Oh. You know.

People can buy an L-Bank. But I. I'm like.

Nah. That's. For the audiences.

That we're catering for. You know. We can.

Like they. One. It's going to be tough for them.

To figure out how to do L-Bank. And two. I want to make sure.

That we're really offering something. That is completely different. And I think something like this app.

And the ability for merchants. All across the United States. Conservative merchants.

That share our values. That's something. You know.

That first kickoff. Is so important. And so right.

And I know. I can get it right on the marketing. I just want to.

Get these apps out. Make sure the website is perfect. Make sure everything is as good as can be.

And we got it. And again. We just got Transact.

API approved. If people are familiar with that API. We're on the Play Store.

We're on that. We're just on the cusp. We're that.

You know the meme. We're this close. We're on the verge of greatness.

We're this close. And that's how I feel. And it's like.

You know. I'm awake at night. You know.

Thinking. Right before I go to sleep. I'm like.

Oh man. We're this close. I want to go to sleep.

Once we're there. Once we're at that place. Where we have these apps out.

And the website. Is as good as can be. Is great.

Then. I can just get this in the front. Of all these people.

That have heard about crypto. That have heard about. You know.

Things like blockchain voting. Etc. You know.

Know the importance. Of blockchain and crypto. But it's too difficult.

To get into it. Even with Coinbase. This is.

This is the solution. And this is what we're making. This is why.

I know. It takes a little bit of time. But it's.

It's important to take this time. To do this right. So I appreciate.

Everyone's patience. With us. And I know.

You guys will be happy. Once I. Once I.

Put. All of these interviews. You know.

Back on the books. And even. And I've been using this time.

To even expand. You know. The influencer network.

That we're going to have. Expand the amount of viewers. I'm going to copy and paste.

All the tweets. All the interviews. All the TV hits.

Etc. In this discord. One after another.

So that way. You guys can also. See it.

And you guys will be able. To see the downloads. On the play store.

And all the reviews. On the apple app store. And you.

Will post analytics. And stats. Of all the amazing.

Traffic. And movement. That we're getting.

And obviously. I think it's going to. My opinion.

Is going to help the coin. A lot too. So.

I appreciate. Everyone's.

[Speaker 2]
Patience. I'm pumped.

[Speaker 1]
I'm jacked. Jacked to the tits. As.

As people. On the big short. And.

I just want to say. Thank you. To the entire community.

Because you've been sticking. Strong with us. You've been.

You've been helping us. Test this app. You've been helping us.

Go and test. Fly and test it. You've.

You've been with us. All the way. Giving us.

Love and support. And funny memes. The best memes.

The best. And. We're going to take this app.

I'm going to take this app. To Mar-a-Lago. I'm going to take this app.

To all the TV networks. I'm going to take this app. To all the news publishers.

I'm going to take this app. Everywhere. Because.

It's going to be amazing. It is already amazing. And.

I'm just so excited. You know. And again.

Boris. And Bannon. They text me.

And they go. We're pumped. We're ready.

Tell us. As soon as. It's easy for people to get into.

And we're already. We're all on board. A thousand times.

And. It's so exciting. Just to have their support.

And their love. And everything. And I hope my support.

Also is helpful too. Because. Ultimately.

I'm not a programmer. So. I'm just.

I'm helping these devs along. Making sure they're doing great. They're way.

Leagues above smarter than I am. So. I'm excited.

So. Now. I will take.

Your questions. Thank you. Everybody.

For listening to my. Wonderful. Wednesday evening monologue.

I will take your questions. Tonight.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. Let's see. I'm looking at your questions.

I'm looking at your questions. I'm looking at everyone's questions. People are fired up.

[Speaker 1]
People are posting. Amazing gist. Grant says.

We should all dye our hair blonde. I agree with that. On the app launch.

I think. Everybody in the community. Should go and dye their hair blonde.

And only pay an FJB coin. Serious question. What color Lambo should I get?

See. That's something I can't answer for you. You have to go and pick.

You got to go to the shop. I think. Newport Beach.

Lamborghini dealership. Accepts cryptocurrency. You got to go to that shop.

And you have to go and pick. And. You got to.

You got to decide for yourself.

[Speaker 2]
I think that's a very important. Personal decision. I am.

Listening to everything. What shampoo do I use? Purple shampoo.

Thank you for asking. That's what you got to use. If you dye your hair blonde.

When will Transact be integrated into the app?

[Speaker 1]
The dev team has told me. Has punished me. Verbal.

No. I'm kidding. They said.

They tell me not to give dates. But. Because.

But they've given me a time. When I like. And they said.

A very short. Period of time. So.

I don't want to give you the exact time. That they told me. Because.

You know. In developer world. Hofstetter's law.

Is very real. If you want to look that up. Someone said.

Marketing before the 4th. Absolutely. Marketing before July 4th.

I don't. I don't know why. Everyone keeps thinking.

It's going to be longer than July 4th. Absolute marketing. Before July 4th.

Transact integration. Is not going to take. Too long at all.

And then. Pretty much that. And.

There's one other. Integration. We want to do.

An iOS app. And that's about it. You know.

This other integration. Isn't going to take too long. At all either.

And. Basically. We just.

Submit. You know. Paperwork.

And we're done. In many ways. So.

That's pretty much it. It's just. Transact.

And iOS app. And then. A couple small things.

But those small things. Are. Are.

Are small. So. I.

I appreciate it. So that's pretty much it. How soon.

After Apple approval. Will marketing start? Pretty.

Like. You know. It's just going to take.

Pretty much a week. Week or two. Turn around.

From. When everything is released. For me to schedule.

All these things. So. You know.

I would say a week. Because. I think that's how long it'll take.

But I'm going to say two weeks. Just because. I'm trying to get better.

At allotting. Allotting more time. Setting expectations better.

So. Practically. I think it should take a week.

But I'm going to tell everybody two weeks. Because. I.

I want to set expectations.

[Speaker 2]
To allow. Time. Just because things take time.

I'm looking at all your questions.

[Speaker 1]
Payment support. For e-commerce. Plugins.

Yeah. I think we're. Actually I know.

We're going to have that. Right after. Or not right after.

We're going to have that. Where people can. You know.

Integrate it. Into the website. That's kind of next.

On the agenda. You know. We have a lot of things.

We want to do next. On the agenda. But that's one of the next things.

On the agenda.

[Speaker 2]
After we kind of get all this. Set up in a good way. I am.

[Speaker 1]
What future partnerships. In the conservative community. Are in the pipeline.

For the next three months. I don't want to announce anything. But.

There's a lot of partnerships. We can do. Especially with that website integration.

And there's a lot of people. We've talked to. They say.

As soon as you have that. You know. We're.

We're going to integrate it. And obviously. We already have.

Kind of conservative businesses. That are. You know.

Physical. Which this app will be. Usable for.

In a very easy way.

[Speaker 2]
I just know. The first. Are we worried.

That the app stores. Can cancel us.

[Speaker 1]
That's always a risk. But we've kind of. In our app store listings.

If we pay attention. You know. We try to be politically neutral.

In our app store listings. And again. That's part of the reason.

Why. We did the rename. The freedom jobs.

And business coin. So. I'm.

I'm not particularly. Concerned. It's always a risk.

Again. They re. They re-added parlor.

Back on the app store. We're not a social media app. Where there's content.

To be filtered. In any way. And that's more.

What they're concerned. They're more afraid. Of free speech.

Than crypto apps. And I've also. You know.

Gotten similar. Crypto apps. Onto the app store.

So practically. There's no reason. Why they shouldn't allow us on.

And you know. Functionally. You know.

We're not a social media. App. And that's more.

[Speaker 2]
What they're trying. To censor for. Yeah.

Someone said. Finn has the Elon problem. For giving.

[Speaker 1]
Timelines. Absolutely. I think.

There is this term called. EST. Which obviously. You know.

Eastern Standard Time. Someone renamed that. To be Elon Standard Time.

And then. A lot of my close friends. Have also.

Said that's actually. It's not. Eastern Standard Time.

Or Elon Standard Time. It's Eric Standard Time. Because.

I do. I do give.

[Speaker 2]
Timelines. Than usual. Timelines.

Let's see here. Question. I'm not sure.

Is there an. Influencer slash.

[Speaker 1]
Personality. You can share. That you're excited about.

Someone has to get you pumped. I am not saying. Any influencers.

Till marketing. You know. I wish I could.

I want to. But that's. That's kind of.

That's my expertise. But trust me. You'll be.

Beyond happy. On this front. You'll be beyond happy.

On this front. And. You just got to trust me.

On that front. You just got to. You just got to see.

And. I've already talked a little bit. On this call.

About it.

[Speaker 2]
But just trust me. You just got to see it. Looking some.

For some more questions. I'm just. Looking.

The questions. I appreciate you. Grant.

Surprises are better. Exactly. That's.

That's kind of. My main points.

[Speaker 1]
Special. One of our devs. And one of our helpers.

In many ways. He said. If he gives an.

Influencer. They will get bombarded. Immediately.

Exactly. That's the point. You know.

You want that hype. To come. With.

The app. And not in the. You know.

Hype for the app. With the hype. Of the app.

Not hype for the app. And I know. That.

I've been in many. Discord communities. Where.

In crypto communities. Where. You just want to.

Announce it. Pre-announce it. Earlier than you should.

But it's always better. Just to wait. You actually.

See it live. So. That's.

That's basically my point there. And I appreciate. Everyone's patience.

On that front. Are you guys looking for more team members? Or volunteers to help?

How can we lend our talents? Who should we contact? Contact Grant.

If you. And you can contact me as well. If you have.

A way you think you can contribute. To the app. Either in development work.

Or even just volunteer work. That is not developer work. Just pitch your idea.

Of what you think you could do. And. You know.

Message Grant. Message me.

[Speaker 2]
And we're happy to bring people on. Actually. I think after this app.

We're going to be probably doing a hiring spree. So. This is.

This is. I think.

[Speaker 1]
I have answered. I will take one final question. If anybody wants to.

Ask a final question. On this wonderful. Wednesday evening.

I will. Summarize. What I talked about.

We are approved. On the Transact API. Which is.

Pretty much. The vital API. That we have left.

We're doing a couple. Small little tweaks. Here and there.

But the really. Only thing. That is.

Is after Transact. Is integrated. And not too long.

It's going to be the iOS. App. And then once the iOS.

App. And Transact. Are integrated.

Then. You know. The marketing ramp up.

Kicks off. And then. We'll do a big.

Massive marketing launch. So. There'll be kind of a.

One to two week. Period. I'll say two week.

To be careful. Setting expectations. Where.

You know. You do your last task. Give us our last feedback.

We'll do as much integration. Because. Once we have.

All the apps live. You know. We need to make sure.

That they can scale. The millions of people. You know.

That was the. True social right. It was tough for them.

They got so many people. That. You know.

Their whole app. Was falling apart. And shutting down.

That's what we want to avoid. So. That's why.

When everything's live. I think it's also a good thing. Because one.

It's going to take me. Two weeks. To prep it.

Launch it all. You know. In one.

One day. Where it's a massive success. And again.

I've done that. With freedom. But we got.

Millions of views. On our launch video. We did.

Three and a half million dollars. In sales. You know.

That first launch window. That launch week. We did.

And you know. And more later. And.

You know. It was. Incredibly.

Successful. And you know. It took a lot of time.

To put together. So. I appreciate.

Everyone's patience with us. But yeah. That's.

That's basically it. Just Kinzac integration. A couple other small things.

And this iOS app. Being published on the live. Live app store.

And that's it. And then two weeks. Of beta testing.

Making sure. That'll be more about scaling. You know.

Making sure this can scale. To millions of people. And then.

And then. Yeah. Then.

We're doing a massive. I'm going to get this app. In front of.

Not just millions of people. But tens of fucking millions. Of people.

Tens. Of fucking millions. Of people.

And I think it's really going to. I mean. It's not just.

A fun coin project. I think it's absolutely. Going to change.

I think it's going to change. The country. I really do.

You know. The ability. For conservative.

Businesses. To accept something. In a way.

That's uncancellable. And be able to take. Control.

You know. From these banks. From these financial institutions.

You know. From these payment processors. And be able to.

Control. You know. Their own money.

Which is crazy. That you can't. You saw again.

With the truckers. You saw in many situations. Payment processors.

You know. Like what happened to Gap. And everything.

Like. This is. This is the solution.

And then. We're so close. You know.

Put. Put in the meme in the chat. We're on the verge of greatness.

Where this is. We're this close. And.

I am just so pumped. And again. I just want to say.

Shout out to the team. Shout out to everybody. Thank you.

So much. We're almost there guys. Just the transact integration.

And the IOS app. A couple small tweaks. And we're there.

Thank you everybody. Enjoy. Your Wednesday night.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. Finn. Out.
