[Speaker 2]
V, what is V now?

[Speaker 1]
Awesome, well happy Friday. Sorry, I was trying to get a music bot. Last week I thought it was down.

For some reason it's not in the channel anymore where it usually is. So yes, now that it's been two weeks in a row, it is definitely user error and it's not following the command I'm putting in there to add it back into this. So it's just the bot is just not in the channel.

I don't know how to get it in there because the command that's supposed to work is not working. But I hope you all have had a wonderful week. I didn't get a ton of questions.

Somebody asked, can you explain to the group why the owner of the app, the LLC, cannot or will not pay for the work to be completed with the app? The community doesn't own the app so I'm unsure why the community needs to pay for the app through purchases of the coin. I'm not really sure why the LLC won't pay for the coin.

I can just imagine that generally you keep your businesses separate to pay for themselves. I have no doubt once funds are recovered that they will be put back into the app. But that's really as much information as I have on that.

Another question, I think piggybacking on that is, sorry I don't know why my dog is digging, will the money made by transaction slash gas fees be shared with holders or will not, hmm, with holders or will that go to the owner of the app? I'm not sure what this is referring to because if you're referring to like the smart wallet fees, those are just the gas fees to actually make your transaction go through. If you're talking about the tax, then that goes to the wallets, the marketing wallet which is split into two.

So I'm not sure what that's referring to but if you're in here please clarify so I can answer that. But yeah there's no transaction fees or gas fees going to the owner of the app right now. Will there eventually be no tax on transfers between wallets for business-to-business I'm assuming?

I know that was the goal right now. That is unclear. I know for sure that is the goal.

I'm not sure when that will happen. But I think to get to where we want to be, I think that's very critical or at least lowering that fee drastically.

[Speaker 2]
Still no button here. What the heck?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah I think that's all the, I know the app is still not working as something with a smart wallet not working. It's not, we first thought, the devs thought that it was the wallet out of gas that we need to fund but it's not that. We do have enough in there to take care of transactions so I will keep you updated on that.

Are you the one making Dodge go up? Sure yeah I'll take credit. What is Dodge up to?

I have a ton of Dodge somewhere I got to find it. Is it time for me to sell Ronnie?

[Speaker 2]
I don't think I have access to that account on this phone yet actually. Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
What is the event in Houston in March? iPod and telegram scare you off? Oh sorry I must have missed it.

No you didn't scare me off but there's not a particular event but I mean so far. But I may be in Houston for that week so if I am we definitely want to do something FJB related so if any I'm not sure if you're well you have the Texas there if you are a Houston native and have any ideas. I did try to join a few local groups but hoping to get some more information kind of on pop-ups and stuff like that but the groups I joined weren't what I was thinking like we have local groups here that you join for random information like that but they turned out to be like I don't know that was a there were like some dating groups or something all of them.

Is this an ASMR channel? Um not as far as I'm concerned sir. I stopped working on L Bank.

Hmm that's weird somebody says they can't hear anything. Why is that a diesel heater group? Those groups are I think can be pretty beneficial which is why I tried to join the few Houston ones but I got to keep searching.

A lot of those I think you just like need to be in the area to know what they're named. I know the ones here locally are very like just weird names.

[Speaker 3]
What else? I guess your company can block discord audio. That's weird so they don't block that it's just the audio part.

[Speaker 1]
Interesting. If anybody knows how to work the bot please feel free to help for next time. That's crazy Heath I've never heard of that.

We are still waiting to hear back from Transact. Somebody asked earlier this week I believe to see where when you make a Transact transaction there's a spot that says it's the FJB coin fee. So somebody did ask earlier this week where that fee goes to and our devs don't know so we did reach out to Transact and just waiting to hear back.

They have somebody specific who takes care of that kind of stuff so I'm not sure if they've been off or what but as late as today they are still checking on it so I'll definitely update you on that. It should be and hopefully it just goes automatically straight to whatever you know marketing wallet we have but we'll double check and I'll keep you updated on that. Update you on where your hard-earned money's going.

[Speaker 2]
Anything else? Any other questions?

[Speaker 1]
Update on using some of the LP for a loan to finish this all. The team is looking through those details and I will keep you updated on that. We were supposed to lock LP today due to that we did not so it is being considered but obviously we also don't want to make any bad decisions that will negatively impact us so I will keep you updated.

If not then we will be moving on with the LP lock. Please do not lock LP without taking some out for a loan. We need money honey.

Yeah I I think they they definitely understand that but like I said a lot of those you know as you know nothing is free and I do understand there's interest but I know they're looking over it and seeing if that's the best decision for us to do. Whoo awesome. I recorded it too so or it is recording so I'll upload that as soon as I'm done too just in case you didn't hear the first part but I haven't really had a ton of questions mm-hmm Wow telegrams very active tonight for a Friday night.

Thank you guys for your patience for doing voice a little bit later too since it's getting chilly here I gotta walk the dogs a little earlier and then my husband has been getting home from work super late so although today was actually super warm we could have done it later. I take them once during the day when the sun's out and another time at night they still bother me. Just hit point nine is that Dodge?

I know and by chilly I mean today when we I took them out around noon it was 65 I think it was actually really warm today that's what I'm saying it could have we could have probably done a later walk today. I could never live in that kind of cold. You guys are a different breed hmm point oh nine.

[Speaker 2]
I gotta check I don't even remember what I paid for that.

[Speaker 3]
36 Celsius. What is that? Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Oh that's hot. I'm in the desert and it's not even that hot here yet. Where are you?

96.8 degrees.

[Speaker 2]
97 degrees. Wow.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's up to 120, 122, 123 here in the summers. Ronnie how much Dodge do you have that you're watching it so closely?

[Speaker 5]
119. Yep. Sounds about right.

[Speaker 1]
Looks like tomorrow's supposed to be a little bit cooler though through the next few days at least. Nice.

[Speaker 2]
I don't even know or remember honestly what I have. Let me see. I'll look it up.

Let's see how much Dodge I have and if I'm up on it yet.

[Speaker 5]
Come on, log me in. Yeah, that's funny.

[Speaker 2]
There's so many steps.

[Speaker 3]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Dodge. Oh I only have like 2,000 Dodge.

[Speaker 2]
$300. Not terrible.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. Without wanting to go back over what I missed, LP not locked. No, we were supposed to lock LP today.

I did send some information over to the team regarding a suggestion from some of our holders to take out a loan against the LP so that is just being reviewed and considered. We do take your input seriously so that's just being reviewed and considered by people much smarter than me and if the team does not decide to do that we will be locking LP this week I believe. This coming week.

But there's been many suggestions about that this week so that's reason for that. It's not because B&B are considering not locking LP. It's not because they're considering taking out the LP or rugging anyone.

That is not the reason. Definitely not. I know because I've gotten a few DMs regarding that.

Can we ride this Bitcoin train up? Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I think it's coming. It'd be nice if we get a nice pump.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, riding the B&B. Hey, I'm not mad about it though. It's not too shabby.

Wait till B&B is over 600. All right, Ronnie, make a dodge go up so I can sell and buy some FJB. I'm drinking a Zevia ginger ale.

It's too hot to make a hot tea. I'm trying not to drink.

[Speaker 3]
Who is this? Who are you? Who's pretty fucked?

[Speaker 1]
In your opinion, if Transac has the off ramp operational in quarter one will be launched. I do believe they'll have the off ramp operational at the rate they're going, even though they're still testing. We're still early January, right?

But I believe more importantly is our app being fully operational, fully functional. So like I've said before, even as Velo suggested, the best way really for us to stress test the app and make sure we have all the bugs figured out is to get some organic, slow volume coming in, just gradual volume versus just a crazy war room pump all at once. And then the app breaking after an hour or two, that would be awful.

You guys are creative with your names. What would you say accomplishments were this week? Well, the charts up thanks to B&B.

But as far as accomplishments, we're honestly still waiting for pretty much everything. We did get a few users issues squared away. So we know those aren't bugs.

It was a few users who just got new devices. And that's why their app, their VESS wasn't working in their app. So that's definitely good.

What else did we actually cross off the list? The PO box, we're still waiting. I did go today.

They said it was supposed to be one to three days, which it definitely has been since I scanned in my IDs. So they said to check back Monday. Dallas, getting, starting to see what we can get planned for that.

Would you consider turning off smart wallet if we get off ramp from Transact so we could launch? Well, the issue is without smart wallet, it was kind of a little, well, it was a lot more of a hassle. Because with, you know, boomers, they're gonna buy, say $30.

And, you know, I don't know, so whatever it is, they bought FJB or what have you, they're gonna have to have Ethereum gas to do anything. That was the issue we were running into before. So then we're gonna be getting emails and messages in the chat rooms and having to send these people Ethereum and letting them know because just gonna let them know that transaction failed.

They have no idea why. And it's because they don't have Ethereum in their wallets. Are there other ways to stress test the wallet?

I'm sure there is. I assume there is. I shouldn't say I'm sure.

I'm not a dev. That would be a question for Velo. But I imagine with any testing, it would just be tons of money then.

And having testers do it rather than just putting that money into some grassroots marketing, whether it's a table selling gift cards, getting people signed up on the app that way. Boris does like us. Boris is a man.

He has that fire energy that we need.

[Speaker 4]
My gosh, you guys. Oh, boy.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, I will not do that. I don't fan mail. Oh, so cute.

Do you expect Boris to schedule a time in January? Um, we are trying to get Boris on a monthly interaction with FJB. Whether it's posting on his social media, or Discord, or, you know, what, what have you anything.

So I will update you on that as soon as I have something confirmed.

[Speaker 4]
Thanks. Thanks.

[Speaker 1]
Jiggle jiggle reminded me of jigs before I saw the jigs. Who was telling me they made cheese last week? I haven't done that yet.

I made the butter and then I made frozen custard, which was amazing. But I think I'm gonna try cheese this weekend. Oh, you ate guinea pigs.

Oh my gosh. I've never heard of that. I didn't know anybody ate them.

Jigs sold? Did he really? Is that why he's been gone?

And egg? Where's egg?

[Speaker 3]
Goat stew?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, Jeff says he has no idea.

[Speaker 1]
I didn't realize. Why is goat? Is goat supposed to be cheap?

Is that why that's all you can afford? Sarah, do you know if the team has discussed a loan for the LLC to get the app done soon? They are considering a loan on the LP.

But outside of that, no. And I'll keep you updated on that. That's why the LP wasn't locked today.

Because if we are getting a loan against it, obviously we got to do that while it's unlocked. Who owns the LP? FJB.

The holders, essentially, the marketing wallet, right? So yeah, boosted like six times. But that's not why.

That's not why it happened, though. Is there a way we can track daily or weekly app downloads? Maybe just post it on Discord so we can chart new users.

We could also then compare downloads to actual percentage active and used accounts. It would be nice to see a constant update. Just a thought.

Yeah, absolutely. We can do that. Vess has that data.

The strange part is they said lately we've been getting a lot of users based in China. They actually asked me about that to see if I had anything to do with it or if we were, you know, promoting our app in China, which we are not. But they said they'll update me on that.

See if they have any more information. Could have been something like the old team had set up, possibly. I'm not sure.

But I know we don't have anything and we don't pay for anything or, you know, anything shady or anything like that. So I'm not sure what that's about. But lately, they said the past five, six months, most of our app downloads have been from China.

Yeah, I don't know this Chinese spice. I'm not sure why an animal getting bred impacts the meat. Unless you eat animal sex organs, which is gross.

What? Animal organs are like the best thing for you. So what is this?

Because Biden's president that makes us all Chinese. I don't know who PolitiEFT is, but that's funny. Yeah, you gotta you gotta try those animal organs.

That's the best parts. Well, you got to make sure to it's a quality animal.

[Speaker 4]
That's funny. Where did you even find that? That baby's so mad.

That's not real. Is that real? Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 1]
Does Bello have a view or preference on Alone on the LP? I'm actually not sure. I have not asked.

We can definitely ask him and see what his input is. I'm sure he's come across those types of loans before, I'd imagine.

[Speaker 3]
That baby is so mad. Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 1]
Chart not looking too bad. Telegram's always asking for that chart. So I see it pop up.

Any injury report updates on Bello? I think he's been well.

[Speaker 5]
I think Bello's been doing pretty well.

[Speaker 1]
Flute, you missed it. He was saying that that's happening soon. Very soon.

Oh, see, you were telling me it was user error. So before, the music bot would show up in that other voice channel that we have for the mods, and then we would just move it into the main voice channel before voice, but now it's just gone. So I don't know what happened.

Maybe Donnie would be able to help. Where's Donnie? Where's Donnie been?

[Speaker 3]
What is this? Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. Is Donnie out hunting? Doesn't he hunt?

Or is he just out drinking? Is there a feature list of what comes next for the app platform? Yeah, right now, so Smart Wallet was obviously a big one.

We're trying to get that all worked out. Excuse me. Oh my gosh.

Why am I yawning? It's barely seven o'clock, and I have been waking up at four. Excuse me.

So next after the Smart Wallet is adding... Oh, the gift cards are being tested still. So adding that and adding merch.

This is off the top of my head. I can make a more organized list to share with you all, though. Then adding the gift card merch on the app, kind of in a banner setting.

We'll make the Smart Wallet toggle at the bottom a little bit more clear. Maybe include some kind of pop-up when you click on it that explains what Smart Wallet is. Also adding the FAQ on these in the Smart Wallet.

I know those are the top few. A few other like very minor but kind of big details that just again make it very boomer user-friendly, if that makes sense. But I can share a more organized list with you all of everything we have planned for that.

The issue with white paper. So we're keeping pretty much almost everything the same. We just want to finalize everything with BNB before pushing that out.

We just don't want to promise anything kind of like the roadmap and put dates on it and then let you all down. I just want to make sure we have that commitment from BNB. Also just kind of depending on a lot of things right now as far as the LP loan, how to fund that, getting gift cards out so we can start doing in-person marketing.

One avenue for stress testing could be conservative groups at universities like Texas A&M. The testing is most likely based on volume of transactions and not amount of transaction. Could be a good pool of people to contact.

Yeah, that'd be awesome. That's a great idea. I think colleges in general for sure.

Definitely hit up those conservative groups. Heath says conservative colleges. Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

I guess it's pretty conservative here, but I know most colleges have like Republican clubs, so that's actually a great idea to do those events where, you know, where they all set up tables. I know, do they still do that? I went to college so long ago.

God, I'm sure they still do. When Moonpay? I don't know.

I was never able to use Moonpay in Arizona.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not sure if that's a state thing or...big. That's funny.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, Don, I do think universities would be awesome. We have tried reaching out to Turning Point several times.

[Speaker 2]
Let's do that again. Maybe I'll do that tonight. Go through all my emails.

[Speaker 1]
Have B&B looked at opening up FJB to integrations, vendors, utility, etc. Is there anything that community can do to assist? Yeah, DM me.

We always have a ton of work we'd happily take volunteers for, but yeah, we have had people come out to or contact us regarding businesses that want to use FJB as soon as that's available. Were there never any FJB merch stalls and option to pay at Trump rallies? Was a no-brainer before the midterms?

Yeah, we know there's unfortunately a lot of things that were missed opportunities, but I did, for what it's worth, I did ask for us to be at those. This is back in, actually back, wow, I'm trying to remember the timing of this. It was definitely when the Trump rallies were going on, so how long ago is this?

Maybe earlier this year, but no point in rehashing that. I guess I'm sharing the same gifts and telegram. Land of missed opportunities, home of the brocade.

We've learned and granted we are moving forward slowly because it's a little bit hard to move forward with almost no funds, but we are moving forward and that's honestly all that matters, little by little. I don't know how much you all read or if anybody's read Atomic Habits, but that's a book I reread a few times a year and he talks a lot about getting into habits and just getting the just one percent better and I think that goes for us here too. We really should be at all the new upcoming Trump rallies.

Yes, I absolutely agree and this is why, this is the whole idea behind gift cards, right? The whole idea behind gift cards is definitely less of thinking, oh this is for you guys to send gift cards to your friends or your family, although that is nice, right? Like okay if somebody has a birthday or you know it's a nice idea too, but that's where the whole gift card idea came from is so we can have this these in-person booths to very easily be able to sell 25 bucks or 30 bucks to somebody in FJB without having to sit there and have you know them make an account and go through KYC and just go through that entire process to be able to do it in literally just a minute or two. So that is definitely the goal.

[Speaker 2]
Bannon had public CSQ the other day.

[Speaker 1]
It could be a good connection for FJB. I've been slacking to be honest. I haven't watched War Room this entire year.

I need to get back to that. Usually I listen to them in the morning to the first show when I walk the dogs, but I haven't been doing that lately.

[Speaker 2]
Let me see, I pulled them up.

[Speaker 1]
That's a cute Valentine's Day card. I did a Trump themed one last year. I don't remember what it said, but it was definitely a Trump one.

[Speaker 2]
It wasn't that one. I don't remember what it says now actually. Now I gotta Google.

I just Googled them and I thought I'd see the one I did, but I don't see it so I don't remember.

[Speaker 5]
I'm not ready. Well, let me know if you have any more questions.

[Speaker 1]
Gosh, are people back from the holidays yet? It just seems like everybody's still away. You're retired.

Well, that's nice. I'm ready to, actually I'd be, I was gonna say I'm ready to retire, but I'd be so bored if I did. People keep harping on no utility for FJB.

What utility does Dodge have? What utility does Litecoin have? Is the willingness of people to use it for a store of value and transactions in the future?

Litecoin has actually held up pretty well, FYI. Yep, I agree. I think even just being a conservative coin is enough, but I think that definitely helps.

And I think there's, I mean, there's room for us there and I think everybody, any conservative, would think it's a really good idea to have our own currency in a way. Shouldn't limit to Trump rallies in my opinion? Yeah, absolutely.

For sure. I think, I think Trump rallies was probably just mentioned because he does a lot of rallies, right? There was, I don't know if you guys saw, there's rumors that Kanye got married so that he can get ready to run, getting his family picture complete before he runs.

He did get married, but the rumors, that's why he got married. Actually, that's a great idea. I was thinking of wrapping, what I'll do is I think I'll wrap one of my cars in an FJB wrap.

I think that'll be fun. Once we get some volume going. And then we can literally just like stop at universities and hand out FJB merch and cards.

But we need a little bit of funds for that. Who are you? Whose alt is this?

Who's PolitiEFT? Somebody build an app where it tells me all the alts because I'm jealous I don't have one. I am broke.

I am. Maybe that's why. Ronnie.

And I'm tired of it. Come on, let's get FJB moving. We're gonna have to start eating carbs and ramen noodles soon.

What was your old name? Public AMAs are easy. Many would be interested in our wallet.

We can definitely check those out. I'm not sure what the cost. I know like all the solicitations I get for AMAs.

I usually get those on telegram. I know those are pretty cheap, but then I look at the groups and I'm positive that that's not our audience. So it's one of those where it's like okay do we want to spend three five hundred bucks on really an audience that's really not interested in us and probably just pump and dump if anything versus spending a little bit more on a quality marketing.

Are we planning to issue an FJB credit card? I believe that that was in the plans quite a bit ago, several months ago. We have not seriously looked into it especially right now, but I think that'd be pretty cool.

I know a couple of the red variety. If you're still talking about the AMAs, feel free to send them over and I can check out their pricing. Cheers to that.

Well I am sorry for for what it's worth. I try to get as many of you all unbanned back in the day. Win more good times soon.

So so soon. Can't wait for everybody FOMO back in. Do we know how many transactions go through the FJB wallet daily?

Yeah we can check. Yeah we can definitely monitor that. We have have some transact numbers up but of course that that's just transact.

Let's see let's pull up last month's monthly performance report for transact. So this was for December. We had over $9,000 in successful orders.

We had 66 successful transactions and 24 unique users.

[Speaker 3]
And last month was very very slow but not not the worst right. Let's see. Let's check more of our transact numbers.

[Speaker 2]
So we can go back and look at November.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe so in November we had a little bit over $17,000 in volume with transact and 75 orders. Take it back to October. October we had over $38,000 in volume and over 115 orders.

[Speaker 6]
Not terrible.

[Speaker 1]
September was over $33,000. August was over $87,000 and almost 250 orders.

[Speaker 5]
All right well that's all I have for the night.

[Speaker 1]
I'm hoping next week is more eventful. I know I thought that last week but I think everybody's just taking their time getting back. You know everybody I think that everybody after this last year or two everybody kind of needed to step away and hopefully reset a little bit, me included.

Thank you all for your patience. I have no doubt we will get through this. Again I know we're moving a lot slower than we anticipated but we are moving forward and our funds are safe and we'll keep you updated.

About the LP loan against the LP, I'll keep you updated on that too but I have no doubt that our team will make the best decision for the holders keeping in mind that you, the holders, and FJB the coin is top priority in doing what's the best interest of the coin which means you. So just keep that in mind. I have no doubt whichever way the team decides to go it will be in the best interest of all of us whether we lock all of LP or do take some to the side to get the app rolling again.

Either way even if we lock the LP all of it will still be moving forward again with the little funds we do have and starting at events, not very costly events but you know gotta start somewhere. Yes absolutely I think so too. Folks will come back around when things start moving a bit.

I think a lot of people are still come in and are still watching us because they do realize the potential that we have which is again it's huge. I mean we have Bannon and Boris so yeah I have no doubt we'll get there. Thank you all so much.

Thanks Ronnie. Ronnie's gonna send me a fan mail. He said we will own nothing and be happy FJB holders.

What? No no I don't like that part.

[Speaker 5]
I love the funny gif.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Thank you all very much. Have a wonderful night.

I'll get the recording up right now before I forget for anybody that did miss the beginning even though we really didn't have that many questions. Have a great weekend.
