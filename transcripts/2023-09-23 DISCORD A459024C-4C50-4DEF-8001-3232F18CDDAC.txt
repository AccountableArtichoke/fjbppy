[Speaker 1]
Hello, happy Friday. Hello, happy Friday. Can you all hear me?

I do have the recorder going. I was just muted. Awesome.

Perfect. Well, happy Friday. I hope everybody's had a wonderful week.

It's been a great week here. Probably one of the best weeks we've had in a while, actually. So I am feeling great.

You know, just some weeks it just seems like you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and this week I could and I'm very, very excited about that. And I can't wait to share that all with you. First, we have the addition to the task has been completed.

We are going through the final testing phase there and just making sure that everything is 100% secure because that remains the number one priority. I'm sure you guys see how many people we have against us now, let alone when we do start growing the community. So again, just making sure that every detail is secure.

While we are at this phase, we're also getting two different parties to go ahead and review everything. So that'll be great and just give us that extra layers of security. We just figure, again, we've done all this work and we've waited all this time.

It would be a bummer to just basically have one little mistake or something unnoticed go under the radar and kind of F everything up once we are live. So that's great news. I'm very, very glad to be where we are now.

So that's the best part of the week. The worst part of this week is we are just having difficulties with the app. And I know, again, it's not that something is wrong with the app in the sense that, oh, I've heard so many people, we need to just throw away the smart wallet.

But more so, just working backwards and so many components. So that's just been the slowest part of the week, if you will. Again, the good part of that is that this is all work going into help us for the future.

Basically just the foundation, rebuilding that foundation with the app and how everything works, and getting everything worked backwards. While we're there, we are also, so after we get the transactions failing, fixed, we are making the sign-in, we're making that priority, just the account creation process and accessing your account. We obviously, with wanting to grow the community, that's a huge, huge aspect, it's just the ease of use.

I know I was talking to one of my neighbors who watches War Room a ton, and it somehow came up, FJB came up, and she said, oh yeah, we saw that, we tried to buy it. I don't remember now if it was around the time the app came about, but we couldn't figure it out. So, very, very excited about that, and the ideas we're bouncing around to implement while, again, maintaining security, but making that super easy to help grow the community.

So, I'd say that's, again, the strongest point, the weakest point of our week. Let's see, I did have some questions. Okay, so, today is the end of a two-week period.

We were told the third party would have commenced their work by, have they started? No. Again, I'm not actually, I'm not sure how clear I've been on this, but the third party is ready to start as soon as testing is completed on this final, final edition, which, again, so far, everything's gone really, really well.

We are just making sure that everything is secure before it passes the testing phase, but everything has gone as planned. Everything with this edition has been completed within the time estimate we were given, and that's been great. Is the team confident the task will be revealed and live during September?

I'm honestly not sure about that, because we are at, what, September 22nd, so that's, again, we are in the really final, final stage. We are closer than we were Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We're closer this morning than we were yesterday.

I know, I think I updated you all in Telegram yesterday, so we are moving forward, but I am not sure and the team is not sure that we will be, you know, have everything live by the end of September, because, again, third party has not started yet, and testing has not been completed and pushed through for this final edition. Right now, we are working, again, on getting that final edition, complete testing, push that through, and then we just want this to get reviewed, but that should take a maximum of one to four days, max. Um, what else?

I think that's, I've got a few, oh, a few Discord. I don't think I had questions. I got, uh, I think some people from, just, you know, people who are, uh, wanting to be funny in my DMs, so that's very cute, uh, but I think that's all the questions.

I think that's everything. Um, I have, I do have a meeting tomorrow with one of our partners, um, and then today I had an attorney, a meeting with our attorney a little bit earlier. Um, what else?

We had a meeting tomorrow, yesterday morning, very early in the morning with one of our dev teams. Um, let's see. Got an update today, just actually super recently, probably within the last hour.

Yeah, 3.55, um, my time, uh, with our dev working on the app. Um, and again, that's, uh, like I said, that's been the most, uh, challenging part this week. However, once the devs, um, who are currently working on that final addition to the task complete that part of their work, we'll also add them on, uh, to get that app figured out.

Uh, that way the few of you who have your app, uh, your fun stuck on the app can get those out. Um, and we can get going to work on the account creation, just making that a little bit, um, more simple for new users and you, so you're not locked out of your own account. We are hearing the feedback.

We, you know, we understand. And of course, while security remains the number one priority, uh, we also want you to be able to access your funds. So everything good there.

What else? So at this point, if, uh, if we're going live in October, I think that puts us at still a great time with the, uh, getting the political, uh, donations function added to the app, um, and also gift cards before the holidays, um, and events. I think that's a, uh, puts us still, still a great time.

Although I'm still waiting for B&B to do something. When do you think the third parties might start? Um, I honestly couldn't tell you if I was even guessing right now, I couldn't tell you because everything has gone, uh, as expected with the addition to, uh, the task in the past, what, week and a half now, I think.

Um, so if that go, if that's completed by the end of this weekend, like it's supposed to, let's see, calendar. Let's talk, let's talk scenarios. I just don't want to give you, uh, excuse me.

I did make myself a lavender coffee. Okay. So Friday, we still have, we still have nine days.

Okay. So, or, oh no, that's October 1st. Okay.

So if they are done, let's say by the end of day Sunday. So by the end of the weekend, uh, then we have, uh, let's see if we want a review, then that should be done. Let's say a solid by Friday.

Then that gives us, assuming no changes there. I mean, okay. Let's, even if you say that stretches out also an entire week, that puts us on October 1st.

So if they finish the addition by Sunday and everything's completed there, uh, which we are just waiting actually on their wallet to send another payment. Um, then if the review takes even a few more days than they say it will, that puts us, let's say at the end of October 1st, Sunday, then if it takes the entire 10 days, um, that the third party said, um, then we're also six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Then we're at Wednesday, uh, October 11th.

So that's, um, October 11th, thinking that everything taking a little bit longer than expected. And that's, uh, getting two reviews on the work that the devs have been working on for several months now, actually. Um, so that, uh, yeah.

The positive side of that actually is while we have, because everybody working on this task is separate from the app, um, so the longer that takes and the review after it's completed, after this team finishes this addition and they move on to also help with the app, uh, the good news is then we'll have the app, we'll have several devs working on the app. So it would be really awesome if they get those few additions completed by the time task is live. Um, that would be great.

That would be wonderful. But we are not, um, not, we are not, uh, waiting for the app to be, the failed transactions to be fixed before we go live. That is independent, uh, of the task.

But that would work out really great if that, if it worked out that way. If the devs were able to solve the app issues and add a few additions before task was live, that would be amazing. I need some, so I, uh, redid my office room and now I need something on the wall.

So then I took down all, well, not all, the major, like my major painting on the wall, which is like a really nice desert painting. But now I feel like I need something Patriot Pay related behind me. I got a few more DMs, but I think they may have been more personal questions.

Uh, do remember to get your coins off XT, please. If you do have coins there, do get them off. If you need help with that, uh, please tag, DM me, or email me, or ask anybody in the chat.

Actually, probably don't do that because you'll probably get scammers messaging you to, uh, move your coins to them. But do get your coins off XT, whether you're moving them to Trust Wallet or MetaMask, please. Do be very careful of clicking on any weird links.

It's been, it's been quite a while since we've, uh, had anybody, I think, get scammed, which that's, that's great news. I will let you know how tomorrow's meeting goes. Actually, I need to check on that.

It's your time. Cool. 2 p.m. my time. Just joined. We'll catch up later. You happy with the situation, Sarah?

Yes. Bob? Oh, we have another Bob?

Oh, it's MP. Bobby. My, my bird will call you.

Bobby. Bob. Uh, yes, I am, I'm very, very happy, and I am, there was a few additions at the end that, uh, the team really insisted on adding that I did not want to do, because I did not want to keep extending this out.

But now that it's towards the end, I am very, very happy that we decided to do that. And I do appreciate, I do appreciate the nice and not so nice DMs, but I do appreciate that greatly. And I think time will show.

I'm very excited. I like being great. So time will show.

Yeah. I think it's great. And I can't wait to finally, finally, once the day does come, depending on, again, so many factors and third parties and dev teams and devs working on this and this and this.

Again, the day, the day will come. Can you count on two hands the days remaining? I honestly don't think so.

I don't think so because that'll be after, for sure, this edition is completed, which again, it's completed. It's just going testing. We're at the end of testing, but we just, again, want a few eyes to look at it.

And we just don't want the same devs who created it to be the devs reviewing it. So that needs to be completed. Once third party starts, then I'd say we can do the count on two hands the days remaining.

But even then, I've seen how this whole task has played out and just dev work in general and things pop up. So yeah. Once it gets that close, I think I'll be freaking out for sure.

Will the team have a launch party? I feel like I'd be the only one who'd show up because Boris isn't even here anymore. Although Boris is closer now.

So that's good. He's not in Arizona anymore. Then he moved to New Jersey.

And now he's closer on this coast again. So that's nice. Has the blockchain advisor had an impact on the team?

If so, could you elaborate? Yes, absolutely. He is our main guy and our main advisor.

And he is amazing. Absolutely. Absolutely.

Where did all the Bobs come from? Hey, my bird likes Bobs. So now Bob's Bob.

Will there be a Holders party for going live? Maybe a Boris or Bannon voice chat? Yeah, so Bannon and Boris just want us to have everything together before they get on voice.

So that's not up to me or up to our advisor. But as far as the Holders party for going live, we'll get something. It'll be worth it, in my opinion.

It's getting closer and feeling a lot more real. So that's good. Bob Black.

That's the first time you see that one. Just gonna come in. It's just gonna be a bunch of Bobs.

Ultra suede says prizes. Hey, we'll know when we get there. But I think it'll be it'll be fun.

It'll be fun. And to finally celebrate, I'm gonna call it the I don't know, what should I call it? Let's see.

I'll have to brainstorm a few ideas. Yeah, it'll be a good day. I'm just hoping that everything continues going as intended.

Again, I know we're having a rough time with the app. But that's independent of the task. Thank God.

So I really am just hoping that everything with the task continues moving as intended. That would be great. Thank you, Bob B.

You have a great weekend, too. It won't be a great weekend. The weather's nice.

Dogs are happy because we're back to walking. They're several miles a day, so they're not driving me nuts. We'll go do the food bank stuff tomorrow morning.

Come back. We have that meeting. I'll update you on that meeting.

Should be good. Hoping that Dev gets closer as far as the app goes. But again, better the app than the task.

That's fine. We'll get the app figured out either way, but that's everything. All right.

Well, you all have a wonderful night and weekend. I'll be in general chat as usual or DM or email me if you need anything. Again, get your coins off XT, please.

Again, thank you for your patience. Thank you for the kind DMs and not-so-kind, too. I'm getting very, very excited, and I know how frustrating that is for you all to not have any idea of everything that's happening, but you will soon.

Again, the goal is to get it done right, and as you all see, it's very, very, very important. And security really does take, you know, we want to make that a top priority along with something that is long-term that is going to help us grow the community. So while we understand it's taken, again, way longer than even we expected, way longer than the Devs expected, way longer than third parties expected, our goal has remained the same, and that is to make something that is long-term for long-term growth and long-term community growth while keeping, of course, security a top priority.

So, yeah, it'll come with time, and that's better, I think, than just getting it done quickly or not getting any of these really cool additions that you all will see, or having, you know, something that is not so secure that's going to be easily attacked one way or another. So that's going to remain our priority, although I want to go live as, trust me, more than you all do, but again, there's no use in doing that if we're not doing it right. So, on that note, I will update you after our meeting tomorrow.

I'm going to see if we, our Dev might be in that meeting. I'll check on that. But I will update you after that meeting.

Probably, I'd say, what, depending on how long it goes, 3, 4 p.m. my time, I'll probably just make an announcement, maybe. And then we'll go from there. I'll keep you updated if anything else happens before Tuesday.

So, I'll update you, yeah, definitely, before Tuesday if testing is complete, if we get that function wrapped up, or start that review. Alright, I will talk to you guys soon. I will post the recording right now.

Have a great night.
