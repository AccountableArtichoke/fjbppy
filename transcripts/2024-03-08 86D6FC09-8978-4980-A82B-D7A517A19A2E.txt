[Speaker 1]
It's restarting, so I'll see if it works on my desktop. Something weird is happening with Discord. Is that everybody's or just mine?

[Speaker 2]
If it'll let me join now. It's so strange. Yeah, it's not letting me join.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Let's see. Can everybody hear me?

Oh. So maybe Discord can't. Because I only have one mic now.

Okay. Let me know if that doesn't sound right. Anyway, happy Friday.

I hope everybody's doing well. Sorry about the very late voice chat. The conference didn't start until later, so it went on a little bit later and then stayed after to talk to a few people.

And I'm good at talking. So then I grabbed food so I can come up here and eat. And then I had to shower.

But thank you for joining me. Thank you all for participating in the contest. I don't know how many 50,000 PPY coin increments there are.

And I literally just sat down. So I have not looked through them yet. So if anybody already has those calculations, let me know.

Holy smokes. Wow. Nice job.

Okay. Updates. We have devs that promised that they will have what we've been waiting for ready by Monday.

They were supposed to have something. Well, they were hoping to have something ready for me today. But I have not heard from them.

So we'll see if they have it tomorrow. But anyway, they said if they do not have it by Monday, well, they'll have it by Monday is what they promised. So I will keep you updated on that.

I'm hoping that that's possible and have it done by then and we can move on. Other than that, we should be regarding Apple, we should be receiving a call within the next 24 to 48 hours from like, probably like noon today. So I would say by Sunday, they told us they were supposed to call to verify some information.

That's the next step we're waiting for. After that, this gentleman said it should be five to seven business days. So I will keep you updated on that.

And that's just to verify our new LLC. They want to make sure all that's verified before our app name is changed in the App Store from Freedom Jobs Business to Patriot Pay. Other than that, I don't think I have any major updates.

The conference is actually going really, really well. I love how, I don't know, this one, this one's just I think CPAC was awesome. And, you know, TPUSA Amerifest was awesome.

But I think this one's very, very concentrated. So I think I think we'll be getting a lot out of this already have so far. I will keep you updated.

Same with CPAC. Let's see if I have any questions. I don't, I think all the questions I've had in DMs are more customer service related stuff.

And you guys have been blowing me up. So I'm glad you're all figuring that out. Let me know if you do have any issues.

Please don't be afraid to tag DM, call, text, whatever you need to do so we can get you taken care of. The educational videos are going great. I don't know.

We're going back and forth on whether to have a voiceover on there or not. So we'll see. But other than that, they look great.

Again, we're starting so, so, so basic. So it's not probably not going to be useful. The first dozen probably won't be useful to you guys.

But it's where we need to start for our customer base and our target audience, right? Gosh, I don't know how much of the crumbs got in here.

[Speaker 2]
It's not in my case. That's weird.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know how that happened on my keyboard. So let's see. It doesn't look like I have any questions in DMs or emails.

Oh, taking a break from the winery. Oh, must be nice. What a tough life.

Operator error. Yeah, I'm not. Something's up with my Discord on my phone.

My desktop needed an update, but maybe that means my phone one needs an update. I'm not sure. I'll have to go in and see.

But it brings up the green button. I hit join voice, and it doesn't do anything. It's weird.

It also says no one's here. But on my desktop, I do see people in there. Can you say what kind of conference?

I missed that. Yes, it's called the Replatform Payment Sponsor by GapPay. Their whole thing is just working towards a freedom economy.

So everybody here is working towards that purpose. It's a bunch of people who've been canceled, some business owners, and then a bunch of finance-related stuff to build a repatriate economy. It's been really great so far.

It's only been a few hours of the conference itself, but I'm really excited to continue. I've only made it to two booths so far. I think I've spent like an hour, an hour and a half at each one.

So I'll get the rest of them wrapped up by the end of the weekend, and I'm very excited to see what comes of that. There's somebody here, crypto-related-wise, there's somebody here from Bitcoin Magazine. So I talked to him a little bit, but there were a few other people there.

So I'll probably speak to him more one-on-one tomorrow and see what we can do there. I seem to look like a really cool dude. Any update on when there will be a burn?

What is preventing the team from going ahead and doing that? We still have to airdrop to wallets. We still need to make sure the smart wallets are working because we will fix those errors with coins that we have not burned.

If we already burn the coins and we do not have those coins to use, that is why we've not burned coins. Burning coins will not impact the value of your coins. It's not going to make your coins worth more.

It's not going to make the price in your wallet go up. Oh, by the way, the price not showing up in your trust wallet is because CMC and trust wallet. That is not an issue related to us, just like the Apple, just like the Google.

I've been hearing a lot of chitter chatter. Again, if you could do it better, go ahead. Go do it better yourselves.

I don't appreciate the fake news. I'm all great with taking criticism where it is due and where we have lacked and where we've done wrong, etc., but I am tired of hearing it for stuff that is just plain wrong. So we'll go there.

Yeah, I think that's all I have to say about that, but I will keep you updated. You think App Store? No, this is not just App Store.

This is just App Store's verification system. So once they verify that information, then they will continue on with the other steps. So the 24 to 48 hours, we receive a call with somebody who talks to me to verify the information and then five to seven business days to get it approved.

And then it goes back because this is not Apple. This is an Apple partner that does the verification and then it goes back to Apple, but I will keep you updated. Did you ever get CoinMarketCap fixed?

No. CoinMarketCap trust wallet is working on that and CoinMarketCap is working on the Let's Go Brandon. They are still working on that.

Last time I spoke to them, the trust wallet was this week. I don't remember exactly what day. They assured me they have not forgotten about us.

It's just a very long waiting list. CoinMarketCap, I spoke to today again about noontime when I was doing all my checkup calls. Wear a low-cut blouse for Bitcoin.

Somebody else do that. I've done my time there. I see the logo has been updated in CMC.

That is new. Yes. Even that took a few emails.

I'm actually surprised because when I asked them, earlier, they told me to keep waiting. I didn't even realize I had changed. I had to go in there and change it a few times.

[Speaker 2]
I want to go in here and see.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see. Self-report. Oh, look at that.

Is it showing up weird on you guys' end or is that just my hotel Wi-Fi there? Mine looks super weird. Does everybody else look like that?

I wonder if that was after today's email. When did that change? Does everybody else's CMC logo look like that or just mine?

Maybe I need to get on my hotspot. We were having an issue with some third party. Is that still present?

We're only having one issue with a third party, and our team is handling that. My CMC still shows FGB. Okay.

Well, maybe. That's weird. Who said it was?

Pierre said it looks new on his end. That's weird. Yeah, exactly.

And I haven't even had a drink yet. So it does. Stacey's looks like that too.

Once the third party issue has been handled, do you think there will be rapid progress? There's already somebody else working on it. Independent of that third party.

We also have another team working on it. That's weird with that logo. So wait, is yours not showing up that way, Pierre?

That's weird.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, mine shows up that way still. Bummer.

[Speaker 1]
I was hoping that it was just my internet. I mean, once the issue has been resolved, will things then progress rapidly? Things will progress as rapidly as our devs can progress.

That's software development for everybody. This is not just us. She'll follow Grace from War Room.

She's had that issue with her app. Yeah, I can't make you any promises. I can only update you on the updates we get.

But again, everything else is moving forward. Yes, we are. Obviously, the marketing's waiting on the app, but the nice part is silver lining is that we have, I think, I want to say three deployments now.

Then with the educational segments, it'll be four deployments ready to go. Let's see. Oh, that's weird.

[Speaker 3]
Somebody's...

[Speaker 1]
Weird. Here still shows that one. Yeah, so maybe, I imagine maybe they started working on it after today's email, maybe.

Maybe it's still in the works, because mine is showing the updated logo, but it looks a little squiggly. It's weird. What else?

[Speaker 2]
The other email address. Nope, nothing there. Let's see.

Let's see how many. Oh my goodness. Let's see how many buys.

[Speaker 1]
Or how many entries, rather. Let's see. What time did I announce the contest?

My gosh. Okay, I think I got started with this one. Let me know if anybody's already counted these, so I don't have to go through them.

If you already did, I feel like Z-Money probably already probably already calculated it. He probably already chose a winner. Let's see.

So what we'll do is see how many 50,000 PPY increments there are, and then take that number and enter it into the random.

[Speaker 2]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Holy smokes, you guys. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so it looks like 42. No, it doesn't need to be exactly 50k. We'll check.

Thank you. Oh, it looks like I missed a message from you in December. Gee, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Somebody else said they messaged me, but I don't see it. It's not it. Oh, there you are.

[Speaker 3]
Archives.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see if these showed up over here.

[Speaker 1]
No, I don't think they did. Okay, so did anybody else do any change now buys that didn't DM me? Because we should have 24, I think, or 44.

I'm sorry. That's correct. We should have 44 entries, I think.

Ah, okay. So the CMC app needs to be... Oh, yeah, for sure, Mike.

I think somebody asked. Sorry, I should have added it to the rules once somebody asked that. But yeah, somebody asked if any buy, of course, counted.

And I'm pretty sure I have it at 44. We'll do a second count. I need to go downstairs and get water.

I forgot to bring some up with me. I hope they have... I think they have water and glass here.

So this gym doesn't have a water like, you know, fountain in their gym, and I'm really disappointed. Because that means I gotta drink water from the plastic bottles. I want to have some in glass, but I'm kind of doubting they do that here.

I imagine Vegas is not the place, at least on the Strip, to have water and glass. Maybe CVS. I wonder if CVS will have...

No, they probably don't either. I don't know. I'll check when I get down.

But I'll have water. I have a coffee and I have a yogurt drink.

[Speaker 2]
21, 22, 23.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no, I think I missed one. 45. I think that's right.

Okay, do we want to do a random... Do you guys want me to do it? Somebody else want to do a random...

Verifying you're human. Enjoy, Ed. Share a picture of your winery or your wine, if it's red.

I'm not really a fan of white wine or any of the other, you know, any of the other ones. Okay, so minimum one, maximum 45. Anything else?

Unless somebody else wants to do it. App correct too. Oh, how weird.

So I have minimum at one, maximum 45, and let's see. How are we going to number them? How are we going to do...

Is one going to be the most recent or one going to be the oldest? You guys decide. Then we'll count from there.

Oh, and then I got to figure out actually where the change now ones are. Well, shoot. Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
I have the time on these, but I don't know the time zone. Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
See if I get any replies. Okay, so we might have to wait. I might have the number of whichever the winner is.

I guess we can do that, and then I will have to wait to see which wallet it is once I get the change now times to see where those fit in with the rest of them. So we have one through 45. How about number one be the most recent?

Does that sound right? Be the most recent buy. So we'll do that.

The oldest buy will be 45. Is that good? And then I'll hit generate.

It's generating. It says nine. Do I need to screenshot this?

Okay. But that doesn't really tell us much until the two change now buys. They screenshotted me, but I don't know what times those zones are in.

[Speaker 2]
So I should put it in the console. Put it in here.

[Speaker 1]
And then, oh, actually, I'm still working on the graphics, by the way, for the March store for the other two winners from a few weeks ago. I did not forget about you, I promise. Okay, so once we get the two change now buyers to tell us, tell me their time zones, then we can figure out where those fit, and then we'll see who is, let's see, who is transaction.

Let's look at it right now without factoring in the change now ones. It'll be, oh, it'll be whoever bought the seven, whoever bought the $761, I think, number nine. Wait, I think it would fall there anyway.

I think it would, because that person had, what, 21 entries? Yeah, so I think, because even if those, wherever those two buys fit, oh, yeah, so that's the winner. Who is that?

Oh, and then we said we'd have two. Oh, wait, you guys are supposed to remind me of this. We said we'd have two winners, so I'll keep this between one and 45, right?

Or we can remove, we can remove it and do one through 44, because we removed the previous winner, and then I'll hit generate. 27. So we'll count 20.

I think that one, that one may need to wait, yeah, for the change now. You guys need to remind me of this. I almost forgot that I said we'll do two entries.

Boom. So those are the winners. Again, number one will be the most recent buy, and we'll count from there.

Nine and 27, so nice job. Congrats. What is, let's see, what is 100 PPY worth now?

Oh, that's not bad. 70 bucks. Not bad.

CMC app was last. Oh, we'll try to refresh. That's so weird.

Yeah, I wonder if it's an iPhone versus Android. Let me see on my phone what it shows up as. Trying to figure this logo, CMC logo mystery.

Oh, my Discord on my phone isn't updating at all, actually. What is going on? Is there an update?

Is there an app update? Oh, I do see, no, I see an update, but it's not Discord related. What the heck is going on?

Yeah, even my general chat does not. What the heck is going on? It's very strange.

Well, we'll see if that updates overnight or something, but I can't check. Okay. How's the horseshoe in Vegas?

Fine, I guess. Everybody here is really awesome. Everybody I've met so far at the conference is awesome.

No, my friends from CPAC didn't end up making it. They will be there in Dallas, they said, but to be fair, it was short notice. I asked them, like, I want to say two, three days before.

So it's just me, and I don't think I've seen anybody from CPAC yet, but I think a few of the booths should be booths that were also at CPAC, so we'll see once I have time to go to all of them. But yeah, other than that, I guess this used to be, I guess this is what Bally's turned into, his horseshoe. Just really wish they had the water, you know.

I don't like water bottles. And their gym is, meh. But I will survive for Patriot Pay.

You're welcome. I will deal with a crappy gym and bottled water. Um, okay, I think that is everything.

Oh, quarter one goals from roadmaps, still on track. Yeah, so far. Um, yeah.

Buy bot and discord isn't updating. Yeah, the buy bot and discord isn't as sharp as the one in telegram. I don't know if that's discord related, or if that's bot related, but discord is really acting really weird on my end.

It's like, it's not updating on my phone. I wonder, could it be, oh, maybe it's due to my wi-fi here. Let's see.

Oh, you know what, I think that's what it is. Let's turn the wi-fi off and see if it works then. I bet you that was it, which is weird.

It wasn't telling me. Yep, it updated. My October Vegas crew is excited about Horseshoe.

Oh, are you going in October? Uh, you strike any deals at the conference? Any crypto collaborations?

Um, a few very, I stay, that's why I told you guys, like, oh, I'll wrap up here shortly. But I stayed after to talk to somebody for a really long time, actually. That, yeah, I hope something can come out of, I'm very excited.

We'll talk a little bit more tomorrow. And we already exchanged information. But I think this might be something really awesome.

We'll see. I will keep you guys updated as always. But yes, already spoke to a few people, including an MD who is interested in accepting PPY.

And actually, she said it while she was on stage, not PPY, but crypto. And that would be awesome, because that would be our first MD, which is super cool. Which I didn't know, by the way, that I don't know if you guys remember.

I remember, because one of my super liberal friends, um, what is that? Um, because my super liberal friend, uh, sorry, I'm going to just, posted this, but it was the FDA meme, if you guys remember that, uh, with the horse on it. And they were, uh, referring to ivermectin, saying, like, ivermectin is for horses or something like that.

Well, this lady is actually suing the FDA. It first got dismissed and she appealed it and that got dismissed or whatever the verbage is for that. And now they're actually back on track and it's going pretty well.

So super cool. Uh, but yeah, I think that's again, tonight was really, really short, especially with, uh, starting so late, but I'm sure the next two days, probably tomorrow will be a very, very long day, but I'm super excited. Yeah.

Horse paste. It works. Okay.

Well, I think that's everything I got. Um, I think I'm going to go downstairs and get water. I don't know what kind of, I don't know if you guys are like camels or I always have to go to bed with my water bottle by my nightstand, even though I think rarely do I ever get up and actually drink it in the middle of the night, but I don't think I'll be able to go to bed without grabbing some water first.

So, um, I think that's everything. As far as the winners, we'll figure it out once I hear from the two, uh, change now buyers, but I'm pretty sure, pretty sure that number nine would fall under whatever that large buyer was. And then the second one was, I think it was 20 something, 27.

That one I think would have to wait, but either way, I put those screenshots in there so we won't forget. Just make sure we count from the most recent buy as number one, and then we'll go from there. Um, you guys have a wonderful night.

I'll, I'll get back on here after I go downstairs to grab some water. I'll be back. So I'm sure I'll see you guys in there.

Let me know if you need anything. In the meantime, please don't forget, don't ever share your information with anybody. I feel like when we go a few weeks without saying that one of you guys will get scammed.

Uh, just be very, very careful, even with the clicking links or answering calls. Remember, I'm never going to call you. No admins are ever going to call you.

So if you ever get a call that looks like it's from one of us, don't answer it on, especially like the telegram ones. Just don't answer those. Better to be safe than sorry.

Um, but you all have a great night. Let me know if you need anything else and I'll see you in the general chat. I'm gonna post the recording as soon as I'm back up.

Let me just grab some water first and then I will post it with a few notes. You all have a great night.
