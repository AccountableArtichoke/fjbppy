[Speaker 1]
I don't know if there's another issue with sound, so I can try to fix it. Happy Tuesday. Thank you all for joining me.

I didn't really have any huge updates, but just hopping on in case anybody has any questions. I did receive a few questions in my inbox about the LP lock. LP lock has not been locked yet, an LP provider has been chosen.

Some more questions about the app or a launch ready date. I honestly don't have a ballpark for you, so I don't want to give you any wrong info. As far as Boris getting on, we are trying to plan something for the year as far as something that's like monthly or more of a scheduled way for Bannon or Boris to join us, share on social media, somehow interact with the community.

So we are trying to get that scheduled for the year just to make it something that's more of a regularly scheduled kind of thing. And then as far as the white paper, so same thing on that. We are just pretty much keeping the old white paper, but we are just waiting at this point for B&B.

We just don't want to promise anything to the community or release that without getting the time commitment from them, if that makes sense. I think, let me see, let me check my Discord. I don't think I got any Discord.

So I think that's all the questions I received in my inbox. If I did miss anything, please let me know. I saw some messages go into my archive on Telegram, but I'm pretty sure I got most of those out.

Everything I could find. That's not a scammer. I'm sipping on my milk thistle tea, trying to have more tea and broth this year.

Oh, a small update from me on the gift cards. Vests and gift cards are being tested. So hopefully that means we are in the very, very, very final stages of the whole gift card situation, which is exciting because once that is completed, then we can finally start going to in-person events and hopefully selling gift cards in person.

How are you? Are algorithms trading FGB? Do you mean, I'm not sure if you're speaking of the Lbank and the XTbots?

I know I saw some talk of that earlier. Let me know. I'm not sure if that's what you're referring to.

The devs are not working on any tasks right now. They, well, I should say the gift card devs are working on, they're testing the gift cards right now, but the app devs are not working on anything right now. They are waiting for the gift cards to be completed so we can incorporate that into the app.

Regarding the algorithms, GoTrucker says, I'm not sure. A buddy of mine that knows charts alerted me to it. I was wondering if you knew any more about it.

I do not. I do remember, gosh, a while ago, probably close to a year ago, was when the trading bots came up and I can look through my notes for information we had on that regarding Lbank, well at the have a Juno Transac update, they are still testing. That's according to Transac actually today.

Our B&B opened to a community design section in the merch store. GenX and Jeff Roge could come up with some fire designs and maybe they get royalties for those sales. We can definitely bring it up.

Yeah, I'd be more than happy to bring it up. Our overhead on merch is pretty low, as it is, but we have nothing to lose to bring it up. And we're not always taking any suggestions for merch, too.

We got a few of the app issues resolved. So just to make it clear, if you guys do get a new device, so whether that's, you know, so if you signed up with your vest on your original device, say a phone, and you get a new phone, you won't be able to log in. You would have to add that device, you'd have to go through your steps.

Now this is why it's important to have your keys handy, but we've gotten a few instances like that in the last few weeks. I think probably people getting new devices maybe for Christmas or the New Year and not realizing that that's why you're unable to sign into the app with a new device. So just something to keep in mind that doesn't mean that something's wrong with it.

That's basically there for your security. Ed says, any LP lock update? No, we are still scheduling a time, but I promise I will keep you updated.

A LP lock provider has been chosen and the LP will be locked. BNB's wallets are also still locked. So just FYI.

Can you add a new device now? This is regarding the FJB app. Can you add a new device now like a computer to have two ways in?

Yes, absolutely. Yes. You can also add a friend, which obviously could be like your significant other.

But yes, you can absolutely add more devices. It's probably a safe thing to do just in case. Any idea on how?

Can you say who's been chosen? We'll announce that as soon as it's locked or as soon as we announce probably the time. As soon as we announce the time, schedule a time, I'll let you know who the LP provider, lock provider is.

Excuse me. Can't talk today. Any idea how long the lock will be?

I believe before we've done six months. Not sure if they're doing that again this time. It's nice because then you don't have to worry about it.

But if you want to make any changes or anything like that, then you probably don't want an entire six months. Should we lock our wallets? Sure, Russ, I'll lock your wallet.

Send your address. Actually, I have your address. I got your address from somebody once.

Because you were like, I don't know, you were close to the next million or something. So I anonymously sent you coins. Guess it's not very anonymous now.

But I probably have it in my inbox. I don't like vets for that reason. Little over the top for me.

Yeah, I understand. Maybe you won't care right now. But maybe if you had like hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in your wallet, you would.

Does trust wallet do the same thing if you change devices? So trust wallet, you have to put in your keys. So which is the same thing?

Because if you have your keys from vest, you can enter that into trust wallet or you can enter that back in. Were the winners for the 12 days of FJB announced? No, honestly, for two reasons.

Our wallet right now, we have no funds coming out just until gift cards start. But also I like it's very, I think like a few people participated in the entire 12 days. But we definitely that doesn't mean we're not giving out the prizes.

Just waiting for gift cards. You can still keep buying if your wallet's locked. We'll just lock everybody's wallet.

There you go. Yes, lock LP lock intact structure will take an effect at the same time. And I can't wait to update you.

Go truckers. That's how are you doing? Everything good?

Yes, thank you. Appreciate it. Just you know, just getting settled in the new year last year.

Or I should say the last half of last year was rough. So just getting settled in. Still still sad about my bird trying to get into the new year.

Got COVID-23. Boo. New Year, same me.

Yeah, pretty much. Larry. It's my golden doodle Larry.

At least the DAX mandate got dropped. That's something. So that's definitely where my dog's name comes from.

Actually. Not sure if that I probably should be embarrassed about that. But Z money says, hypothetically speaking, if someone randomly sent like 50k to the marketing wallet, can we get some shit moving asking for a friend?

Excuse my language. Yep, I'm sure we can. Less than that.

I don't I don't think we'd even need that much. But first we'd get all the app set up and then we'd start blasting out events because holy smokes. These event fees are insane.

Ed says apart from gift cards, anything else being worked on in the app by the devs at the moment? No, we have that on hold because unfortunately, funds are very low. So we'd hate to spend everything we have on features versus working out the bugs.

If that makes sense. Please let me know if you need me to clarify. But basically we have a limited amount of funds right now.

So we'd like to get the gift cards completed, which that's what all the devs are working on right now. Nothing else on the app. And that way we can start volume.

Once volume starts, then we can start working out bugs. And we can spend the little bit of funds we have working out those bugs. So we can get more volume and hopefully raise more funds.

Does merch shop have a wholesale feature? Not sure what you mean by that. Like a discount for more pieces kind of thing?

I believe they do some sort of discount like that. As far as us, like selling the merch in person, it doesn't make sense for us to go through the Printify. So we're using a local printer for those shirts because they'll be a lot lower and that way we forego shipping costs too.

For the same exact shirts, we can get the same exact brand shirts, but it'll be a lot better profit margin wise. Probably less of a headache too though. Can people still buy direct from Marketing Wallet?

Yes, absolutely. We have a ton of people actually participate in that. It was amazing and we haven't needed to sell probably for a few weeks now.

Appreciate these meetings. Oh, thank you. I'm glad.

I appreciate truckers too. I don't think any of us would be able to do anything. Appreciate.

Yeah, I was gonna say, I appreciate truckers with cats, but you guys already said it. And I'm allergic to cats. Very, very allergic.

Although I do wonder actually. So generally, if you have allergies, that just means you really have a toxic overload and you really need to work on your liver and toxins. So I've been doing a lot of that the last year or two.

So I wonder if I would be as allergic to cats now. I love watching cat and dog videos or cat and bird videos. Cats are mean.

Dallas says, Any update on Boris doing a voice? We are trying to schedule like a yearly, well, more like a monthly, like a scheduled something with Bannon and Boris, if that makes sense, for the year. That way they could have something scheduled for us, whether it's sharing something on social media or some kind of interaction with the community or a call or just coming into Discord or Telegram.

And we're trying to get that scheduled to have a more something on a regular basis to ensure for the people doubting that they are still here. So as soon as that's, as soon as we get that set up, I will let you know. We're just waiting for them.

Tell Boris I said to get his, you know what in here. Yes, go truckers. I think, I mean, even if it's something super small, I don't think once a month should be too bad.

And that way if something does come up or we miss it, then it's at least something but I promise I am working on getting something like that scheduled for us. I do realize your frustration. I have made them very aware of you all's frustration.

But again, this, they feel from their end like, well, this is a long-term project and like, hello, of course we are still here, etc. Zmoney says, can Boris drop in tomorrow and say, yo, bitches, then he can leave. It'll take 1.5 seconds. That's all I need. Oh, that's so mean. That's the worst thing you could do to hair.

Go truckers says they know everything's okay, so they don't understand what we're worried about. Honestly, pretty much. And they, you know, they feel like, well, which is true.

We have done a lot for FJB, which again is very true. Look at all our all-time highs. They've been very, very directly linked to them too.

So again, I hope that is a little bit understandable. Not to say I don't understand your frustration. Yes, absolutely.

Trust me, these are all the ideas that have been presented. 43 million on the way to 44. I haven't even looked at the top 100 wallets to see how that's doing.

Wow, 34 wallets with over 100 million there. And that's not counting that a lot of those people have multiple wallets too, so it'd be funny if we found out that both B&B had different wallets than the ones we know too. He never knows, he money.

Russ says he knows what number 35 is. Ooh, I wonder who.

[Speaker 2]
Now I'm gonna go look. Contract.

[Speaker 1]
$35.94 million, that's nice. Nice. Wow.

Let me see number... What's that, what's that wallet? What is that, number seven?

That was a OG wallet, still holding. It's a win, no IRS. I know, when are they supposed to vote on that?

Top 50 is 72. 72 million. It'd be funny if Janna was actually in here under an alt.

Discord's been quiet. It's Trucker after all. I thought Trucker was a man, but...

I know, I apologize. Awful of me. No more gender shaming.

Just don't ask me to call you by pronouns. I was hoping we'd have our PO box by now. I don't know what's taking so long.

I got everything notarized, scanned it in. Maybe I'll walk in there tomorrow. It's not very far from here.

I'm not sure if the world has GoTrucker. I think it's just, like, literally just this country trying to make it seem like that, because you look at the rest of the world and, I don't know, I feel like they're all looking at us like we're crazy because of all the BBBs. Can't wait till we break 10,000 total holders.

Any ideas on how we can achieve more holders? Yes, absolutely. As soon as that's why it's really critical to get those app bugs figured out.

Um, we have several open tickets this week. Like I said, most of them have honestly been resolved because they weren't able to log into the app if they got a new device. So again, if you do get a new device, you will not be able to just sign in with the app.

You have to go through the steps to add that device, i.e. browser, um, to be able to sign in. Actually, I need to do that on my phone too, because I just had to get a new phone. I haven't been able to log in with the app yet.

Alternatively, you can add other browsers too. So if you're, you know, generally log in from your phone, you can add your laptop or your desktop browser too. By Ultimate Warrior.

Jan says, when do you if I solve FJV problems instantly?

[Speaker 2]
Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like that baby's so large to be in the crib. He looks so small when he turns over. You're like, gosh, he's huge.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Has Vess looked at using just seed words to restore wallets? I mean, you can still do that if you enter the seed into Trust Wallet. As far as Vess goes, though, they are very, very, very security focused.

Obviously, that's literally their product. So, but again, with the way, keep in mind, the way we all set up our Vess wallets way back when is a lot different than it is now for new users. So do keep that in mind.

It's a lot, a lot, a lot easier now. You try to make an account, it sends a link to your email, and I believe you click that. I went through the new account just to make one.

I want to say about like two months ago, if I remember correctly, it's as easy as that. So do keep that in mind. But again, adding a new device or recovering shouldn't be a big deal as long as you have your information.

That's why it's very critical that you do have that information written down somewhere. Or, again, just add in, add extra browsers to your desktop, to your laptop, another phone, have your significant other add it to their phone. Plenty of options they give you.

Can't find my Switch this long. Sorry. It's been gone for like 40 minutes, I figure.

But yeah, I think it'll be a very, very exciting year for us. Just a little hiccup with the funds. Does Finn check in on us anymore?

Yes, all the time, actually. Finn is still awesome. He does still check in on us, especially since he did not get fired, like Jan keeps saying.

When, when, when, when? That's what I'm asking. That's why I feel like asking everybody that we're working with.

Just gonna start writing my emails with the little gif. Oh boy. That's funny.

I don't know why. I think he just, I think he's misunderstood by a lot of people here. But I can, I can promise you Finn is not to blame for really almost any of it.

And I think if you knew the details, you would very much like Finn and have a lot to thank him for. 10k. Yeah, don't even remind me.

It won't matter eventually, I hope. But yes, seeing how much, how many coins 10k could buy today. Whoo.

Yeah, the Ukrainian flag is, especially now knowing what we know, maybe in the beginning, I know a lot of people were, but knowing what we know now. Did you guys see the speaking of, I think as you said, Russ said Richmond, and I'm pretty sure this happened in Virginia. Let me check.

A reporter that got fired for reporting really awful things happening to, at a, I believe, mental institution? Like a government run one, so one that we pay for. Let's see, I was listening to it this morning, but I haven't read it yet.

And she was actually let go from reporting the truth on, oh yeah, here it is. Don't you guys see this? Super, super sad.

Really awful. But the allegations were all proven, by the way. And it just makes me, makes me very angry because I hate people who do that to defendless, whether it's disabled, or young, or very old, seniors, or animals.

But just another view on how the media is working with the government. And Jan says, Sarah, can we put together a task force to study, study using portion of unlocked LP and D5max benefit? I did receive your DMs. That's something we can definitely present. But again, we'd hate to take from the holders. But again, we have nothing to lose to present that. Terrible.

Yes, absolutely. Super, super sad. Lose your job for reporting the truth.

Gotta check with the government first. I know, hoping we're... B&B's not doing too bad, huh?

Let's see what we got today. 277. Wow.

Imagine once B&B's back up to 600s. Have you tried adding grand marinade to your margaritas? Uh, yeah, actually.

It's been a while, though. I like these, like, little mixers now. Although I try not to drink.

I drank more in the last six months than I have in probably the last, like, three years combined. That does sound good. I do love spicy margaritas.

That's my thing. Not sure if you're into that. But grand marinade is definitely, like, one of the secrets to a good margarita, I think.

Yes, absolutely. Social media is amazing, and the website looks amazing, too. I love root beer.

I'm not a soda drinker much, but I do drink Zedias now, and they have a root beer flavor that's actually really good. Ooh. It's been so long since I had those.

Monsters. I used to have the Monsters, the Rockstars. That was so long ago.

Then there's, like, a healthier one. Does anyone know that? I say healthier.

It's an energy drink, but, uh, what was it? Zions. Then I started drinking those, and then I switched to Red Bull.

Now I stay away from energy drinks. Does Zions still exist? Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, it does.

[Speaker 1]
When we dominate the world. You know, I think this year, hopefully. This year feels like it's going to be a good year.

No missing funds this year, so that's a good start. Let's see. I can't find my notes.

So basically, to recap, we are waiting on the FJB gift cards. From there, we'll be blasting out events. We can also include them in the merch store.

You know, kind of like, we can change the shirt prices from, say, a shirt's 20 bucks, we can change it to 50 bucks, and then you receive a gift card in the mail, too. So we can do that, too, which will hopefully bring volume, which then will bring bugs. Well, we'll show the bugs.

I'm sure we already have them. Bring those to the surface for our dads to fix, which will help perfect the app and get it ready for more volume, and hopefully that gets that cycle going. That's pretty much all we're waiting for right now.

Well, we're waiting a lot. We still have our donation, we still have the 12 days of Christmas prizes, we still have our P.O. Box. Waiting on a lot in those terms, but I'm just speaking basically.

Major, anything major that's kind of stopping us from moving forward. Yeah. I'll borrow that to the next.

What was the latest update on the missing funds? I got an update, I believe it was the last week of December. If I'm thinking right, I think I was right for Christmas, but we will keep you updated if we have anything to update on, but that's still moving forward.

If we get off RAM from Tranzac, would B&B go to launch or are they waiting for bugs? I would say that they'd probably wait for the app bugs because we don't want, again, another wire situation, which by that I don't mean that Tranzac would cancel us, I just mean we don't want to go ahead and get on War Room if we haven't tested the app with that much volume. Again, going back to even what Velo said, and I promise that's not anything, you know, we coached him to say, but I think somebody asked him like, how are we going to stress test the app and make sure it doesn't break down and that was his answer is that we'll have to have some steady growth to figure out all the bugs.

Tim says it sounds like there's a lot of bugs. I mean, we're not sure, right, but generally anything like this you are going to have some so we just want to anticipate and kind of think 10 steps ahead because we're trying to do things different this time around. So better to be safe than sorry.

It's more of a precaution because, again, we'd really hate for the same thing to happen and, you know, get 2,000 new users in in the first hour or two and then just get, you know, the app breaks because of some bug. Bye, Russ. I know, where is Weg?

I haven't seen him. Is he still on vacation? Still on vacation with his Asian girlfriend that Z Money says doesn't look Asian.

I promise you guys, she does. Anything new on the Biden files? Biden says he was surprised.

To learn government records including classified documents are taken at his private office. Well, yeah, probably was surprised. Trucker, is that you eating?

Actually, a burger sounds really good. I made, what did I make? I made beef, a whole turkey, and salmon for dinner.

I do need to make butter tonight, though. I had a Wendy's Double Choco Frosty, sounds good. Oh, I did get an ice cream maker today.

Try making my own ice cream so it doesn't have a bunch of crap in it. Maybe it'll, maybe I'll make some chocolate. Pretend it's a frosty.

Apparently, um, the secret to really good ice cream is an egg or an egg yolk. Makes it like a frozen custard. So I'll try that and let you guys know how it goes.

Start cooking channel, FJB Cooking Channel. Ooh, bourbon ice cream. FJB Recipe Book, the merch store.

Right, how to make good food that's not terrible for you. So you get a Slowstar juicer. Huh, never heard of that one.

I'll have to google it. Oh, I have, oh, I have seen the ones where you put fruit. I'm wondering if it's the one I'm thinking about.

Probably, huh? I usually do put, um, haven't done that for a while, though, honestly. Frozen fruit in, like, a blender with a tiny bit of yogurt, make it extra creamy.

Bourbon ice cream, then you can put the, uh, the fruit beer on that. Ooh, I don't think that's the one I've seen, though. Looks pretty nice.

I've heard of the Omega ones. I wonder if it's similar to that, because it kind of looks similar to the Omega one. That looks delicious.

I want juice. Venus IO from Jan. Yeah, it's crazy, the difference in, uh, juicers.

Lots of cats. I feel like Telegram's definitely, like, the cat people. And not just Paradox.

Definitely keep you guys updated, though, on that ice cream. Ice cream probably won't be tonight, because I do need to make butter tonight and clean up that mess afterwards. Ice cream, I have to freeze the ice cream bowl, so I gotta put that in the freezer anyway overnight.

Maybe tomorrow. FJB ice cream. That'd be good.

Actually, that would go really well with the whole Vidon ice cream thing. How do you make butter? Um, just get heavy cream.

Well, I'm sure there's many ways to do it. I just do heavy cream in my KitchenAid, and then you have to keep, like, I'll take it out intermittently to get the liquid out, because after it turns into whipped cream, then it starts turning into butter, but then the buttermilk will separate. So you've got to, like, keep pouring that out a few times.

Good night, dog. And then, uh, after then, you put it in a cheesecloth and drink. Oh, shoot, I was supposed to pick up the cheesecloth.

Well, I can still run to the store. It's still early here. Um, and then after that, if you want to flavor it after you, uh, siphon it through the cheesecloth is when you add, like, I'll make, like, sweet ones.

I'll add honey and vanilla, or the salty ones, I'll do, like, garlic rosemary, which I actually just dehydrated some rosemary, so I'll be perfect. What kind of old-timey woman are you? A lot of that happened, like, in the COVID times, when I was stuck home and then started learning how crap everything else is for us.

That's when I started making my own butter. But it's actually really good. So good.

And then I freeze it, because we don't go through that much butter. I'll make a ton at a time and freeze it. Yeah, garlic and rosemary.

I also have some thyme. Maybe I'll throw that in there, make it some, like, Italian butter and a sweet one. And then just eat butter as dessert.

Let us know how that goes, Trucker. He's going to tell his old lady what Gen X said. What kind of old-timey woman are you?

Z Money says it's turned into an episode of Desperate Housewives. There's only one on there that I actually ever cooked, but she was my favorite. I told my mom that she reminded me of her.

Because she's, like, the perfect one. I'm, like, proper. When's the first event for Booth scheduled?

So we have a bunch of events lined up that are, like, more weekly events that you really don't need much time for, that we can really sign up at a week's notice. But we don't have anything scheduled, uh, because we didn't want to pay the fees and not have the gift cards ready. And a lot of the fees, I mean, there's, there's, uh, events that have fees that are, some, some of them even free.

Some, like, 20, 40, 45 bucks. But the really high traffic ones are in the hundreds. Starting in the hundreds, I should say.

Our food is garbage, that's why so many people are overweight and sick. Yep, absolutely. I agree.

You see the difference, too, if you ever travel anywhere else. But it's not by accident. I don't believe so.

What's the weather right now? It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's cold out on the Midwest. I don't even know.

I'm a baby. I hate the cold. I miss I live in the desert.

But it's cold right now at night. All right, any more questions? Oh yeah, I agree.

Um, so Go Trucker says, any events in South Florida? We hope as soon as volume does pick up and we're not talking like crazy war room volume even just you know organic, just old organic volume through booths, through the gift cards, grassroots marketing, as soon as that picks up we will definitely start traveling for different events. That way that gives us a better, just better grounds to cover as far as events go.

But Florida is definitely one of the first on the list. I know our party was supposed to be done by now for everybody to meet everybody. Although I'm not sure who would actually show up.

I would. I feel like Russ would show up too. I'm down for a cruise too.

A J.B. Cruise, huh? I would be definite maybe. Come on, you could just, we'll make it wherever one of your stops is, crazy trucker.

Done. See, that was easy. You're welcome.

Oh, fresh mozzarella. I was actually just looking into how to make cheese this week, but I was on my phone. I forget where I was waiting for an appointment somewhere, so I was supposed to look into it once I got back on my desktop, but that's my next thing.

So I make yogurt, I make kefir, butter, try, I'm gonna try ice cream, but I've never tried making cheese. I'll have to try that. Let's see if I have time this week.

That'll be delicious. Especially raw milk, so good for you. Oh, I bet.

I'm gonna try that. I'll let you know how it goes. Buy good curbs.

Okay, we'll find out what that is. Where's Sandy? We're gonna have a FJB Farmer's Market.

I want a free Bahama cruise voucher. You're at 30% tax. Nothing's free.

Absolutely nothing. Oof. Wow, that's crazy.

It's really high. Love you, too. Have a good night.

All right, y'all, that seems like all the questions. I think everybody's had a chance to step in. I'll make sure I get this recording before I get off.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to DM me. As always, you all have a great night. I'll pop back in probably in 30 minutes or so.
