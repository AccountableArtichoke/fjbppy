Hello, happy Tuesday. Hope everybody had a great weekend. Let's get right to it. 

So TPUSA did change their schedule around a little bit. So our ads actually so far played at Ohio State and Penn State with Vivek and Charlie as the headline speakers. And then they also played us last night at UNC with Charlie and Vivek. 

And then they'll be playing our ad again on Wednesday, so tomorrow, in Michigan, which the Vivek will be the main speaker at. Super cool. We are seeing the numbers increase on our app users. 

So I will definitely share those once tomorrow is complete, add them all up, and update you on that. Our educational videos should be working for everybody now, including Apple users on Apple devices, in the browser, on a Safari browser, and in the Patriot Pay app on Apple devices. If your videos are not playing or you're experiencing any issues there, and this is again through the app or the app, the web app on the educational, down the menu, go to the educational section, you should see the videos, educational videos there.

Again, if you're having any issues playing those, please reach out, but they should be working for everybody now. For by the end of October, we should have the rest of the products added to and we should be, depending on third parties, we should have our direct on-ramp integration complete there. So I will keep you updated on that and also keep you updated on our marketing emails. 

You should be receiving those, but I will let you know once those have rolled out, in case you are not checking your emails. Very excited to finally have that wrapped up and to move forward. Let me know if you have any questions. 

As always, if you are experiencing any issues, please reach out. We do want to make sure we take care of any bugs, even if they are impacting just a few of your wallets or accounts. Again, if you need anything else, please reach out. 

Please don't share your info with anybody. I will update you with anything else. In the meantime, otherwise, I will see you all here Friday. 

Have a great night.
