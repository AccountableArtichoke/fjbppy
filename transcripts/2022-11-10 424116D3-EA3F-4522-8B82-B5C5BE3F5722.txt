[Speaker 2]
Hello, can you all hear me? Okay, I am so nervous.

[Speaker 1]
I'm like downing my first drink first, so I should probably finish this. So please forgive me. I was doing like our last read-through through everything, and I couldn't even read to myself.

I'm so nervous. So okay, what's everybody drinking tonight? Because I have two drinks.

I'm starting out with these like uh white claws. They're called neutral. Okay, I'm gonna post pictures.

Sorry, I'm excited. I have to post pictures about my drinks. Not a watermelon fan, but my notifications.

[Speaker 2]
Make sure all sound is good. Make sure everybody's getting in. Right, right.

You guys can see my thumb now.

[Speaker 1]
It was accidentally in the picture, so it's not as pretty as Grant's, but okay. Oh, thank you, Weg. Actually, let me pull up my recorder.

Oh my gosh, I almost. Oh, Florida, man.

[Speaker 2]
IPA, nice. Okay, quick time. That's what I do to record.

I don't know what else you guys use. Thank you for reminding me, Weg. See, Weg is useful sometimes.

Sorry if you guys hear me downing my drink. I'm so nervous. Okay, let's turn off my notifications.

Let's get quick time.

[Speaker 1]
I have something open for VES for our Google app, and it needs to stay open until they approve it, and I think it's been making everything really slow on my laptop, so I apologize.

[Speaker 2]
Bear with me. Sorry, that's VES on my. I'm going to quit it.

All right.

[Speaker 1]
Let me make sure I have it popping up.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sorry. I'd like to be on time, but that way, I guess we'll make it. Okay, nope, that's not it.

Let me know if voice is too low or too loud, or my dogs are all downstairs.

[Speaker 1]
My husband has them, so yeah, I don't know why my. I'm really sorry. Is anybody else?

I don't know. Quick time. Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
Let's open audio recording. Okay, there we go. Wow.

Okay, thank you. Forgive me. Okay, awesome.

[Speaker 1]
All right, now let me grab my drink. Awesome. Let me know.

Sometimes when I start typing or something, it's like really annoying, and I listen back. I'm like, oh my gosh, nobody told me. Awesome, cool.

Let me, last thing, pull this up. All right, so again, please forgive me. I am so nervous, so first, I want to thank you, as always, for joining me tonight.

I am beyond, beyond pumped, but I'm also so, so nervous. I want to first thank you. Most of us came here together at a time when the government was trying to force us to sit six feet away from each other to wear masks to enter a grocery store, make sure you follow the little arrows on the ground, and then speak to the cashier through a plexiglass.

Unless she, you know, touches all your groceries and hands you your receipt. They forced our kids home from school and destroyed our businesses and jobs. Whether your job fired you because you didn't get the jab, and I know that's many of you here, or whether the company you worked for laid you off because everyone was all locked up at home, so not allowed to patronize the business.

I know for me, this is when I started joining a lot of online groups and chats, and that's how I found FJB, actually through a local investing like Facebook group, and then I found all of you. I never imagined we would have made the connections we've made and formed the community we formed. I'm also sure that Boris didn't anticipate ever seeing Weg's butt tattoo.

I doubt I'm alone when I say I've never been a part of such a strong, passionate, determined community who all share the same values of making America great again, who all simply want a better future for ourselves, for our children, and even grandchildren, even on the days when some of you are driving absolutely nuts. Since day one, I've been one of FJB's biggest cheerleaders. I think we can all agree on that, so sometimes people have told me it's too annoying, but honestly, I was never asked to do that.

It was truly genuine, and if anybody knows me knows, like if I don't like you, I can't pretend to, and that's honestly just the truth. It started with frequenting the chats because I was trapped at home and bored as heck, starting to feel depressed and feel like a failure for just closing down my business that the government forced me to shut down. Croc, I love you.

Croc just asked if I liked him, and excuse me right now because I do have an outline room for myself, so if I'm not following everything on the chat. So anyway, that summer is when I started. I closed down my business late July, August, started to feel depressed because I was stuck at home, and I'm somebody that has to be always going on the go, right?

Basically, I became part of the team, and that was honestly, truly by accident. Then eventually, B&B inherited me, so that was nice. Jiggs, I love you too, even though you didn't tell me Slinky's secret.

Anyway, I've put in tons and tons of time here, guys. Even when I was stranded overseas in December, I was sleeping seriously two hours a night to keep up with FJB and everything going on. Like so many of you, I've put in tons of cash, probably more than I should have before being completely honest, but I did because I truly believed in FJB.

I still do. I truly believed in B&B, and most of all, I truly believe in each and every one of you. Through all of this, I never sold a coin, honest to God, on my little brother's life.

In fact, like many of you, I kept adding and adding. I'd see the overnight swings on the charts and built some awful resentments towards the V1 pump and dumpers. I think we all have.

It was clear that there was a group sabotaging the coin, and I didn't like it. None of us did. Let's be honest, I hated it.

Creating the buy and sell pressure, sabotaging the coin, and the list goes on and on and on. We all know it. But I was here to keep you and myself calm because I trusted B&B, and I trusted their plan.

Heck, I was in half the team chats. I knew they were there. I knew they were pumped.

And that's truly what I kept telling you guys that, okay, I understand because I understand if I wasn't behind the scenes, but I promise you they're there. I promise you they're responsive. And through, like many of you, I've been less than pleased with the management of the coin since December.

It's been clear pump and dumps, let's admit it. False promises, missed dates, one countdown after another, which I hated. One voice chat after another, rescheduled and rescheduled to only be canceled again.

And then, of course, you know, that's when fire came into the mix, and it was an uphill battle. We were all ready to conquer. All to say, I don't think I've addressed this with the entire community at once, but I'm sorry.

I'm truly sorry. I apologize for my part. Although I've honestly been the messenger of all these events, I'm sorry for not stepping in when I could have or questioning management when I should have.

I want to make sure you understand that this isn't because I didn't want to stand up for you or myself and all the money I've put in, just like you have, but purely because I was staying in my lane, so to say. My job was social media and community management, and that's what I did. I didn't want BNB to think I was some crazy groupie, even though it's true, and I'm kind of obsessed with them and their values and their passion.

[Speaker 2]
And I honestly wholeheartedly believed what I was told.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, I love that, the Boris one. Thanks, Chicago Jacobs. So I really hope you believe and I wholeheartedly believed what I was told, and I delivered just that.

I wholeheartedly believe the feelings and optimism I was sharing with you and have no reason to believe otherwise. I still believe that. That's why I'm still here, or I would have left a long, long time ago.

So what's next? Well, we're starting a new page, a new book, a new read. Hey, I'm like a new island somewhere with new rules, new processes, new procedures, honesty, and full transparency.

One where bills get paid, there is no conflict of interest, and promises are kept. But I understand we've betrayed your trust, even though I've truly been just the messenger, and we're doing everything we possibly can to earn it back. So I think it's only right we clean up some of this mess before we ask you to trust us again.

This is why I figured we needed a voice chat. So we'll start with the 9-11 donation. Everybody wanted to know how much that was for.

I am not proud of this. I did not learn this until very recently, so please don't come for me, okay? Oh, thank you.

Even though you love American Express, I do too, but I haven't used mine in months. So I really want you to see how much change we are putting in, and that's what this voice call is for today. I want you to trust us again, but I know it'll take a lot.

And we'll start with the donation, because I still have people asking for that. Thanks. Slinky and I had a talk today, heart to heart.

He has a lot of FJB, and we said we had the same goal. Jigs, who is we? Write that.

Now the team consists of B&B and I. We have a lot of contractors, though. That list has grown significantly.

We'll go into that. Thank you, Too Relish. Thank you, Croc.

So we'll start with a 9-11 donation. Again, I'm not proud of this. I just recently truly learned of this total, so I do not want you to think that I lied to you when I told you I did not know.

Trust me, I feel I am embarrassed. I feel not this is just not for the donation altogether. I feel used.

I feel lied to. I truly, truly feel this, which is so sad. And most of all, I feel so awful for sharing all that enthusiasm with you, although I still am so enthusiastic about the coin.

I do not want you to think this is going to be bad news, because it is not, minus me being transparent about a lot of things with you. Thank you, Chicago Jacobs. I had to grow some balls.

Not like turning into tranny balls, but I appreciate the support. I know how much transparency and truth we need. So starting with that donation, we will start there.

I recently learned this total. Again, I will share that with you. Please don't come at me.

I truly didn't know when I told you I didn't know. That 9-11 donation was $100. $100.

So we will start there, because a lot of people still DMing about that. So let's make that public. All right.

Let's see. We went through that one. Next, we have August 2nd.

And I'll take questions after this. So I'm sorry, I can't go through my list and read all together. So if I miss you, I'm really sorry.

Just type it again, just because I can't follow both. I'm not that multitasking. So then we have August 2nd.

I said this on the last voice, and I'll say it again. I'm sorry about August 2nd. It was 100% a mistake.

The intentions were there. The cash was paid. And the interviews were real.

I can promise you that. I can vouch for that. I was in the group chats with the marketing, with PR.

But we fell short. We fell short. Brock won that bet.

So let's start by paying that debt. Let's pay our debts. Let's start there.

Brock, you did win. Let's figure out. Gosh, it's been so long since I tipped on here, to be honest.

Let me see. What is it? Dollar sign tip?

[Speaker 2]
Somebody teach me how to tip again. It's honestly been so long. Nobody's going to rate me.

Let me see. Is it? Okay, it is.

[Speaker 1]
So that was $2 million, right, Croc? Let me see if I can do this. It's been so long since we've tipped.

Oh, my gosh. Since I've tipped. I know some of you have.

I'm sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see if this works. Boom. Done.

[Speaker 1]
That's one debt paid. Let's get that off the list. We got donations.

We got the Croc paid. All right. Okay.

Next, we have the meme. Hey, Slinky, watching you. We said we had the same goal.

Keep it cool. Okay. You're missing $40 million.

How? Okay. So I'm going to go back to my list.

I'm sorry. I won't be able to follow that again. To be paid for what?

Okay. After that, we had the meme contest. That also never paid out.

I think Jeff Roach deserves that. He's been carrying us on his back for how long now? Really doing what?

99.9% of the memes? So I think we'll go there. And forgive me, we do not have a ton to give right now.

But we'll go ahead and do that. Let's make some wrongs right. I feel like an ex-boyfriend making up for his wrongs.

[Speaker 2]
I would say husband, but honestly, my husband's pretty. Let's see. Is Jeff Roach still in here?

Oh, there he is. Oh, oh, oh. Be one.

Honesty is the best policy. Yes, it is. Let's see.

Forgive me. My mind is like, I'm so nervous that I can't even function. So forgive me.

Oops. Trying to divide up all the coins I have. I think that should be cool.

Oh, there's Jeff Roach. What?

[Speaker 3]
All right.

[Speaker 2]
We'll get, hey, hey, hey. We'll get to Finmin. Finmin's a good guy.

Don't you do that to him. Let's see if this works. Nah, what did I do wrong?

What did I do wrong? No, I did commas the first time. I think there was an extra space.

Oh, really? There's no commas? Okay, I'll move a comma.

There we go. No, still didn't work. See, that was without a comma.

What the heck? Oh, you know what? I think I need to type Jeff Roach out again.

I'm so sorry, guys. Thank you for your patience. This is all new to me.

I am sorry. There we go. Sorry, we're getting better.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Boom. Okay.

So thank you, Jeff Roach. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I also hope one day you believe that I truly, truly did not know about other coins starting until the day they were announced.

I would not lie about that. I have no reason to lie about that. I was never an admin in any of these coins ever.

So I hope one day you believe that. If you don't, but I swear the facts are there. Next, I think we have one more person.

And don't get me wrong, all of you. I wish I could tip everybody, everything we have, but we are working on that. I think Paradox has done one hell of a job doing everything that I was doing that I haven't been doing because we've had so much behind the scenes.

I appreciate that. You've been, oh, thank you. I appreciate that.

So thank you, P6, my favorite cat. I'm allergic to cats. And sorry, I thought I moved enough coins here, but they take like a total.

And so this, I think this will work. Yay. Awesome.

So almost 500, but sorry, we'll make that up to you. All right, Slinky, I'm watching you. Awesome.

Thank you, Paradox. Appreciate everything you do. I really appreciate that.

Good social media with the community. You've done it better than anybody ever has. So I appreciate that.

Next, let's move to our next point. Let me get my drink. I think a little bit, a few sips here.

Did you guys see these little like white claws? They're vodka, seltzer, real juice.

[Speaker 2]
And then I'll switch to wine, I think.

[Speaker 3]
All right.

[Speaker 2]
Talking so much. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So the next big update is we are getting a new tax structure. The new tax structure will 100% benefit all of you holders, not 100% tax, but it will benefit all of you holders. The new tax structure will include at least one of the following.

Percentage to burn, reflections, or LP. We will get you the finalized numbers soon. But I think this will be huge.

This will benefit us, the holders. This will benefit the coin, the charts, and the future of the coin. So I think this is awesome.

I think we should have done this a long time ago. All right. All right.

Our next point. So going forward, I just want you to know marketing funds will be publicly announced. Costs, bills, there'll be checks and balances, donations publicly announced with the amounts, and we'll have votes for you, the community, to decide on.

We're thinking about every two weeks. So twice a month sounds good for a donation. And hi, Swan.

Glad to see you back. I'm not trying to ban anybody tonight. Hold on.

Hold on. Can't do it like Bannon does. Maybe I need another drink for that.

Okay. So we'll do that. Marketing funds, transparency, donations with what organizations you vote for.

We'll do those twice a month going forward. And then let's take some questions before I move to my last point. Actually, before that, I'm so sorry.

I have one more thing. We have a VES update for the Google app. VES, I met the two founders from there.

They are absolutely amazing. They expedited everything for us so quickly. We turned in the update to Google, and that should be ready in a few days.

So I will keep you updated on that. Our app should be back on Google. And I think that is all the updates I have for you.

Before my last point, I am going to ask four questions, and then I'll move to my last point. Okay? That sounds good with you guys while I sit here and have a few drinks.

Let's start some questions. And then the technical ones, I'll see who's on, who's listening to answer some of those, because I don't want to keep you hanging again. I have a few on Velo's list, but I'm sure I could find somebody in the chat that can handle some technical questions.

Raven, timeline on Transact off-ramp. I do not have one right now for you. As soon as I do, I promise I'll update you.

When are BNB going to try and push this mainstream? How is Velo coming along? Velo is great.

He is back in business. He is healthy. And BNB, a lot of that update will be in my last point for you.

I think you'll like it. Where did marketing money go? We will announce that probably in an announcement shortly or something like that.

I am not, by something like that, I am not glazing over it. I promise you that. Scrambled or fried?

Oh, fried. I'm not a fan of scrambled. That's just kind of weird to me.

From Egghead. About eggs. Google app to keep reviews and ratings.

Yes, absolutely. That should all be kept on there. They just needed, so they, Google was trying to log in through the VES and it wasn't letting them for some reason.

So we just needed to update that. Super simple. What was the tax announcement?

We will have a new tax structure and it will benefit you because it's either going to have a percentage to LP, a percentage to burn, or percentage to reflections, at least one of those. What happened to marketing wallet? We will announce that.

We have an announcement coming on that. I promise you.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not glazing over that question. I know that's very important.

[Speaker 1]
How many developers or contractors do we have on the team? Velo, and he has a few devs with him that he brings on when he needs them. I'm not sure how many, to be completely honest with you.

[Speaker 2]
Contractors, that list is growing very quickly.

[Speaker 1]
This isn't a question, okay, I haven't read this, so hopefully it's not too bad. This isn't a question, but a comment, not directed at you, Sarah. I never publicly voice my opinion with displeasure, but that 9-11 donation amount, excuse me, has me riled up a bit.

That disclosure was disgusting. I think FJB, at some point in the future, needs to re-donate to them with a more appropriate figure. I absolutely agree.

I am beyond embarrassed with the money even just me personally put into the project, and I absolutely agree with you, and I feel so much better now being in a position where I am not just the messenger. Don't get me wrong, I will still be the messenger in a lot of ways, because at the end of the day, B&B are the bosses. So do take that with a grain of salt.

I'm not saying that, oh, that's it, I'm in control. No, B&B are. There's going to be a lot of things that I'm still just the messenger on, but I feel so great now that I have a little bit more control, and this has been such a cakewalk that I completely agree with you, because I feel like I've not really had to do or put in so much effort for all these contractors to go above and beyond, for B&B to go above and beyond.

I've really not had to do so much work for them to do that, and this is why I feel so embarrassed, why I feel so stupid, why I feel used. So I agree with you, and that 9-11 donation will be made right. Fellow is great.

Yes, he is. He honestly is the man. Slinky agreed with Drew.

Timeline for the new tax system. I would be lying to you if I told you, but I am trying to make that as soon as possible. Sun Devil, I know you probably can't say much, but can you say whether or not there was intentionally done issues by management or just by letting some of it wasn't so good?

I'm not sure what you mean by that. I'm sorry. Can you clarify?

That way I can make sure I know what I'm answering. Make the next donation. Yes, we will.

We can make that our first donation. Are we going to get a new management team? Absolutely.

Tax starts when? I will update you as soon as we have that. Raven says, oh my god, it has emotions about Drew.

I always just thought Drew was so professional. Him and Spike are just so professional. I wish I were that way.

Diesel says, I've been trusting the plan for a year. Why should I trust it for another year? It was supposed to launch months ago.

You are correct. I am absolutely with you. Is there good news?

Yes. Did you tell them I'm lead dev? Oh god, wag is lead dev.

Oh god, I'm out. Sun Devil, out. Okay, any more questions before we move on?

Have past admins, et cetera, no longer on team? Fraudulently misled the investors. I'm not sure, but I have not.

I can promise you I have sincerely, sincerely been just a messenger. I have my computer and laptop to prove that, that I've never been wiped. B&B aren't stupid.

When are you going to circle back? Oh, that's rude. Who is responsible for the small donation hoax?

I'm not sure. I think Grant made the donation is what I was told. I am not sure.

That's my understanding. Boss and boss. Yeah, B&B, boss and boss.

That works. Who made the 100 donation decision? So the decision was made because marketing funds were very low.

I am not sure who made the decision that I was told. And this is what I was told. So again, please, I am just being the messenger that it was because marketing funds were very low.

Yes, I'm confused. B&B and Finn, all good guys, yet decided $100 to 911 victims was reasonable. Who made the call?

I'm not sure who made the call on it. I do know that they said there was no money. Who were the bad actors in the pump and dump early on?

Grant, Finn. I assumed it was V1. And that includes me.

I was a V1, but I was not a pump and dumper. Finn sure pumped the chart with his digital airstrike chick. That was last push me over the edge.

Excuse me. I'm burping. I will say Finn is not on.

He honestly was also just the messenger. I will say that I have no reason to defend Finn if that wasn't the truth. I am here to give you truth.

I am here to give you transparency. I am not Finn's mom. I am not Finn.

You know, I was not his friend before then. I do like Finn as a person. I'll be completely honest.

But I will tell you that, sure, yes, it was a mistake for him to say digital airstrike. And he has admitted that. I'm not sure if he's done that in chat.

But outside of that, I can tell you he did not have much control over the digital airstrike not taking place. Who was responsible for the small donation hoax? Like I said, I think Grant physically made the donation.

That's my understanding. But again, the reasoning was he did not have any marketing funds. We are moving on.

FJB new chapter.

[Speaker 2]
That's what I'm talking about. I'm absolutely pumped. I hope you guys.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I'm a day one v3 investor even. I'm sorry, investor never sold since launch a year ago. Little out of the loop.

But is there any context why Grant set this up only to move on to other projects? I couldn't tell you. I'm sure that Grant is open to answering those questions.

I'd be lying if I had an answer for you. I'm so sorry. I wish I had a better answer for you.

I wish I knew when war room is coming. That's coming. Also, by the way, I know I usually can't take any technical questions because that's not my area.

But if you do have any technical questions, I'm sure I can find someone online to answer them. Oh, okay. I'm going to attempt to was management intentionally doing wrong by their investors, such as with the $100 donation?

Or was this more a matter of bad management unintentionally making bad decisions? Obviously, the donation is a bit more straightforward, but in other bad management issues. Yeah, so the donation was that there was no money in the marketing charity wallet.

Right.

[Speaker 2]
As far as everything else, let me let me get through the other questions and get back to that one.

[Speaker 1]
Whom it lest you excuse me, my gosh, I'm so nervous. I'm sorry. I promise I'm not drunk.

I'm not even I just but I'm so nervous. Who misled you and everyone else? How did these decisions come about?

See, sorry, I'm just going through what I can answer right away. Did BNB fire Finn? No.

I will say again and again. And please believe me, this is 100% truth. BNB did not fire Finn.

They did not fire him and left on his own.

[Speaker 2]
See, I'm sorry. I have a work. Give me a second.

I have a work. Give me a second, please. I'm so sorry.

And my puppy's going nuts. Give me just a minute. I'm going to keep it here so I can answer your questions and I don't lose them.

Sorry, I just got to get some work stuff done. Give me just a few minutes. I feel so awful.

Trying to text my husband, take care of the dog. I hope everybody's still typing questions. Puppies are going nuts.

I'm sorry. The zoo is not under control today. Larry, go get your dad.

Get out of my hair. Oh, no, Larry, go get your dad. Sorry, guys.

Give me five minutes. Go get your dad. Okay, I'm back.

Can everybody hear me?

[Speaker 1]
So sorry about that. I did not mean to be rude. I'm not trying to string you along.

I know you have all have been through enough. So I'm really, really sorry about making you wait.

[Speaker 2]
Let me see. The computer lost my place. Sorry, let me see.

Sorry, guys. I'm gonna, oh, well, let me not skip through.

[Speaker 1]
Charity wallet. Makes no sense. I only had 100 bucks in it.

Potential time upgrade.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah. Can you start over?

[Speaker 1]
I joined late. No, you can listen to the recording. Okay.

Sorry, I was gone for too long. Let me go to the bottom to see if everybody can even hear me.

[Speaker 2]
I'm so sorry if I missed you. Can everybody hear me? Okay.

I'm sorry. Thank you for supporting Brandon.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I'm sorry if so I didn't read through because I didn't know if you guys were hearing me. Okay.

Sherlock needs to poop. Okay. So we'll get back to all of your questions.

I'll go through those again. I'm sorry. I don't I imagine you guys don't want me to read.

I'm down 35k since Monday. Wow. I'm so sorry.

Money Mitch. Don't be like that. Just start over.

Like says. Okay. Um, all right.

[Speaker 2]
So I'm gonna switch to wine. Red wine. Thank you for your patience.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just I promise I'm not an alcoholic. I'm just this is a lot of pressure this call.

[Speaker 2]
I told you guys it's gonna be good. Thanks for you. I know how tough you guys can be pushed.

You know other people out.

[Speaker 1]
Despite feeling abandoned over grant leaving I trust there is genuine and we'll be holding through these tough times. I if there is one good quality I love about myself. It is how genuine I appreciate that.

[Speaker 2]
I really like that about myself. I didn't know you're balling out like that.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not sure. Oh, 35. Okay.

Joker be nice. I'm watching you. Okay, so we can do questions and answers again, because I'm sorry, I missed those.

Okay, so now I want to preface my final point with I invited every one of you to rally here tonight, because I promised BNB that if nothing, nothing, nothing else, I knew this community. Well, I know that every one of you is more than willing to put in the work to be forced multipliers, and to get the rest of the country to say FJB to pay an FJB to gift an FJB. And most importantly, to donate an FJB from our huge, huge, huge marketing wallet.

And excuse me if I get loud, because I am pumped. So I will preface with BNB do not not that is n o n o t want you attacking anyone, or any other project. They want you rallied together, right here, right here, rally together like we all are right now.

125 people listening. Wow, that's a big voice. Oh, my gosh, you guys are making me blush.

[Speaker 2]
And that's what we're here for.

[Speaker 1]
I promise from you're capable of this. We're law abiding citizens who believe in law and order. We fight for what we believe in our values, making America great again, knowing where our money goes.

And we're under the microscope as it is, right? The liberals trying to make us out to be some crazy maggots, as they used to call us on Twitter before Elon Musk came in. So all to say when I got thrown into this position a few weeks ago, and I had no idea was starting another coin until the day it was started.

Boris had no idea. One of our three founders walked away from the project. I came in and one of the first things I asked, like a person who's ran a business is where are the bills?

Who pays the bills here, right? I truly had no idea. Because although I've been on the team, this wasn't my area.

And again, I tried to stay in my lane, taking care of you guys, the community cheerleader for FGB took care of social media. That was my job trade, stay in my lane. I didn't want to act too excited, even though I was long story short, it was through this that I found out FGB is tens of thousands of dollars behind on bills.

And there are unaccounted for marketing and charity funds. We've had an internal investigation, very, very sadly and heartbreaking. Because you know how personal this is to me, how used I feel.

How embarrassed I feel for being so enthusiastic with every one of you. All to say Boris is evaluating options for legal pursuit ASAP to ensure those funds are recovered. Because that is your money.

That is my money. That is our money. I stress again, please do not attack anyone.

Boris along with a handful of attorneys and accountants will handle this. Boris is ready to fuck someone up. Your job is to be the force multipliers and proof to BNB that we can do this.

We're already getting bills paid again. It's been a nightmare just compiling the logins, receipts, Google app store updates, communication with VES, the devs, the list goes on. So excuse me if I'm being emotional, because I fucking am and excuse my language.

But we will get through this. I believe in you. BNB believe in you.

When all this first came about, BNB said, oh my gosh, we're fucking someone up. But this takes time in court and the community, they're going to be so discouraged. You know what I said?

My answer was no way. I told them, trust in me. If I know nothing else, this is going to get the community so fired up that they are going to be force multipliers and let you do everything you need to do professionally, legally, like law-abiding citizens.

[Speaker 2]
I believe in you. BNB believe in you.

[Speaker 1]
We are a hundred percent under new management and we can only go up from here. And I hope now you understand more of where I've been, that I've not helped start CC coin. I've been right here fighting for you behind the scenes, for me, for your money, for our money, for money that should have gone to charity and marketing.

Don't let BNB down. Don't go after anybody.

[Speaker 2]
Don't go after other projects.

[Speaker 1]
Our job is to show them how well we can do this while BNB do what they need to do, what they're the best at. So I hope that you don't let BNB down, that you don't let me down. And I hope you accept my apology because I feel so used, so stupid, so embarrassed for cheerleading you, the community, your money, along with my money, along with my time and your time.

And I really hope for that part, you forgive me, even though that was just my job. As soon as I came in to take other responsibilities, right away I asked, where are the funds?

[Speaker 2]
And I hope you believe that.

[Speaker 1]
My laptop's still here. My phone's still here. Nothing's wiped.

My wallets are squeaky, squeaky clean.

[Speaker 2]
And I hope we can get through this together and show them how this can get done. Now, I will digress and take some questions. Back to Sarah.

Thanks for your work, Sarah. And you too, Weg. Thank you, Weg, for all you do.

You're welcome. All right.

[Speaker 1]
Even if you can't say who a potential suspect is, do BNB have specific suspects? Yes, absolutely. There are only a handful of people who had the marketing and charity wallets.

Absolutely, guys. Now, don't mess this up for them. Do not mess our legal case up.

Everything can be used as evidence. So please, I need your energy to be force multipliers. We can show them how this is done with honesty, transparency, and really, no conflict of interest.

[Speaker 2]
How is management new when management is the same? BNB are the owners, for lack of better terms, of the coin. Um, yeah, I think that answers that.

Okay. Any more questions?

[Speaker 1]
Blockchain public. Shouldn't it be hard? Got that right.

Everything is all new. Yes, it is. Watch who dumps tonight.

Not me. Not me. Are they still in here?

People from the old? Yeah, I haven't banned anybody. You know why?

We have nothing to hide. I have nothing to hide. The community has nothing to hide.

So we will not ban people for saying the truth. Don is still here. I'm not sure I saw him earlier.

When war room, once we get this shit cleaned up, excuse my language, but I am feeling a little bit fired up or BNB worried about the lost money. BNB are ready to fuck somebody up and get your funds back. Cause imagine how much marketing that can buy us.

Imagine how much money that would be back in LP. Sarah, do you need financial support from the community to get through this? I am willing to help.

No, I do not. Uh, personally, I'm assuming need any financial support. Thank you so very much.

Grant moved 500 K USD, roughly coins to exchange on BNB news and dumped it. Sorry. I was just reading a comment.

That was not my comment. What will we do to raise price? Oh, we have a plan.

This is just the beginning. We have a plan and we are going to prove to BNB. We're going to prove to ourselves.

We're going to prove to our country and the world how well, how easily, do you know how easily I've been talking? I had a few meetings this week. You know, how embarrassing it was to speak to our contractors who are asking me what the hell is going on and why we are not to move when our contractors, some of them are willing to work for free.

Do you know how embarrassing that was for me? I hope you understand how embarrassing that was for me. And I'm not saying that if it's your fault, but excuse me, if I feel emotional after giving over a year of my time, full time into FJB and how embarrassed I am with you, the community, because I've been cheerleading you on along with myself, how embarrassed I am with all of you.

And I truly, truly apologize. And I hope you understand my reason. So does Sarah just steal Joker's thunder?

No, I don't know. I've not been invited to that party. I don't know what.

I think he'll share with us, but we had a good DM. He said he was going to keep his mouth shut, not ruin anything. He owns a ton of FJB, he said, and we all have the same goal.

You must be kidding. We've done nothing but fail, but trust us. Okay, well, I mean, you can leave.

I don't know what else to do for you. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Win War Room. Once we get this all cleaned up, once we get all the bills paid, we will get there.

[Speaker 1]
Have faith. We have so many plans that we will be sharing because we are honest, we are transparent, and we have no conflict of interest. I will not sell a never dumped or traded FJB for one.

[Speaker 2]
You're a diamond holder.

[Speaker 1]
I meant if we watch who dumps, then it will tell us a lot. Yes, it will. The suspects.

I mean, yeah, I have no idea, Shadow, who is and isn't in here. Again, I have not banned anybody because at least for truth and transparency. Okay, what about the gulag?

Well, you know, WEG likes a gulag. How long have you had to keep this held in? Too long.

Too long. When we get funds back, then marketing. No, we will start marketing ASAP because we have money coming in.

We need to get our bills paid and that marketing money. In the meantime, we will be getting everything planned, building a new foundation to do this the way it needs to be done with honesty, transparency, and a bunch of Americans and America-loving people out there and freedom-loving people all across the world ready for FJB. Sarah, how did partners respond when you started paying the bills?

Outlook good? Yes, absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
They absolutely had no clue about the finances, to be completely honest. All right, any more questions? What's the plan?

[Speaker 1]
Only reasoning, I'm listening. The plan, we first have a brand new team. Just before this last point, we are starting with a new tax structure.

We have a lot of bills past due that we're paying off and we will have many updates even just this week. We all understand what this means. Everything you've been mad about is fixed for real.

Absolutely. Everything makes sense now.

[Speaker 2]
More will be coming. Thanks, Sarah. Someone stole some cards.

That's just for recording purposes. I'm reading comments. That is not me saying that.

How are the bills going to be paid?

[Speaker 1]
Bills are being paid as we speak. We do not want to dump on the charts and sell, you know, 75, 50,000 or 50 million, 75 million coins at one time, so we are slowly selling and slowly paying bills.

[Speaker 2]
We need financial support from the community to get through this.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not sure. I think I already answered that, but DM me if you need to discuss further, please. What will we do to raise price?

[Speaker 2]
We will do what should have been done a long, long time ago, and we will have more details on that, probably on our usual Friday night voice and Discord. Okay, I think my Discord is glitching. Hold on.

My Discord is not—are you guys typing too fast? I'm not going to the bottom. Oh, goodness.

Okay, there we go. I think it's—okay, any idea when the next time we may hear BNB invoice?

[Speaker 1]
I am trying to get that this month. I know they are super busy with elections, but they are more than happy to come in here. They're absolutely pumped.

They always have been more than happy to come and voice.

[Speaker 2]
I'm trying to go back because I think you guys are moving too fast.

[Speaker 1]
What bills? Currently, we have a dev bill. We have a legal bill.

We have the regular monthly web hosting domains, online services like Google.

[Speaker 2]
I can't think of their names off right now, but just all the online services to keep our website and app going. It has been hurting. Now, there is actually hope.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, absolutely. We actually have an answer now of everything, allegedly, of the reason why everything's been going the way it has been going. Are the checks into our structure to keep this from happening again?

Yes, absolutely. We are making changes to make sure that people are being watched and this doesn't happen again, that we don't have missing funds again. So, we will know where everything goes and have Excel sheets like a business with this much money in and out usually does.

[Speaker 2]
So, the holders need to pay the bills off. I mean, that's a percentage of the coin.

[Speaker 1]
What checks and balances will be used to prevent this type of thing in the future? I'm assuming from funds being missing and allocated. We definitely will require simple receipts in and out checks and balances, again, like a regular normal business does.

Why is Bannon asking us to pay the stolen fund? Is Bannon broke? No, he's not asking us to pay the stolen funds.

They are working on recovering your money ASAP. What is the time frame for this turnaround? That will depend on the court.

Like an actual balance sheet? Yes, like an actual balance sheet.

[Speaker 2]
Not so hard. What is that? Any other questions?

What's the dollar figure on the missing funds? We are not that information for legal purposes.

[Speaker 1]
I think you can probably go check out the blockchain or hire somebody to do an audit or all kinds of options there for you.

[Speaker 2]
And I don't mean that to be heartless. I hope you understand. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Why do we need to wait until the bills are paid to do war room? Why is my question? Your question is not being ignored.

The reason we need our bills paid to do war room is because we're behind on bills and we're behind on services that we need. We want to make sure that we're 100% ready and our app is ready and our website's ready to take on. This is not saying that our website isn't ready or that app isn't ready, but if we have no funds, what if something comes up?

How are we supposed to pay that? We're covering our money. Y'all need my address to check to.

It will be going straight to LP. Pay me an FJB thing, Sun Devil.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Still waiting on Transact for off ramp? Yes, we are.

[Speaker 1]
Will the new balance sheet be public to holders? I'm not sure of that yet. I imagine that wouldn't be a terrible idea.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Are you saying the recovery of the stolen funds?

[Speaker 1]
I never said the funds are stolen. I'm reading the question. Are you saying the recovery of stolen funds?

We do have missing funds. It's going to hold up the project. No, absolutely not.

BNB are doing everything they can, regardless of which way the project goes. We just know that sometimes legal might take a while, but no, this will not be holding up the project whatsoever. I'm pumped for FJB to be the new Patriot currency.

Awesome. Me too. LP boost.

Do you realize how awesome that is? Yes, I do. Who is auditing transactions moving forward?

We will have all those answers for you soon. And again, everything is ready for you on blockchain. Just to clarify, are you saying the former stole money?

Nope, I am not saying that. Follow up. Have the contract and wallets moved to safe wallet?

Absolutely, they have. This is what we have done this week. We have actually, yes, this week, we have changed the addresses for those to make sure these funds do not go missing again.

We have also removed all untaxed wallets that were untaxed previously. If BNB perceive our reaction to the honesty over missing funds as going well, think they were able to divulge information on what's happening legally in real time issue? You know, Boris, the biggest, one of the biggest attorneys in the country.

So I think that will depend. I am not a lawyer and I do not know the laws.

[Speaker 2]
So I think he will do that based on that. I'm really confused.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, War Room helps the coin and BNB are owners. Why aren't we on War Room if that helps the coin? Well, we have a lot of shit to clean up.

Excuse my language. So if you're not saying the former devs stole that money, then who did? As far as I know, nobody else had access.

So I'm not sure. I am not going to hurt this legal case.

[Speaker 2]
I think that's what BNB for specifically is evaluating legal options for. I'm a forensic accountant. I'll gladly insure all for, let me go back to that, or accounted for.

Awesome. Clean house and move on. That's what I'm talking about.

Thank you, Drew. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Is that all the questions? I know you guys are probably sick of hearing my voice. I'm sorry.

What was the turning point where someone started paying attention as this was six months ago? The turning point, like I said, was me coming in and wondering why the F we are tens of thousands of dollars behind on bills and why are charity and marketing funds all out?

[Speaker 2]
Diamond hands are created from excessive pressure. Bring on the pressure.

[Speaker 1]
What is Joker talking about LP booth? I'm assuming either the percentage of tax going to LP possibly, or the recovered funds going back to LP. What was the turning point?

Somebody says I see CC's booming. Thank you for your transparency, Sarah. Thank you.

Sorry. I never believed you trade worthy with all the DMS that you had sent me. I apologize.

I apologize to everybody here who was in charge of the marketing charity wallet.

[Speaker 2]
To my knowledge, it was our original Debs. That is who I had to get the keys from. Okay.

Anything else? I think that's all the questions. Who's ready for a vote?

Somebody says. Okay. Crazy.

But as business owners, how did this? I'm sorry, Sarah.

[Speaker 1]
For you. Oh, it's okay. I can take it and I'm ready to put in the work for you and for me.

My impression is that BNB were very busy.

[Speaker 2]
They're understanding that somebody else point. How are the keys being stored currently in a locked encrypted?

[Speaker 1]
I just got directions from people way smarter than me to do that.

[Speaker 2]
It's in a locked file. Password protected. Are the websites locked down?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, all passwords should be changed. We still do not have passwords to the exchanges, unfortunately. If anybody has access to those or is able to get access to those, it has been an absolute pain in my ass.

[Speaker 2]
Excuse my language, to get the passwords. Okay. Anything else?

I do appreciate the transparency. Something Grant preached but never followed through. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
I appreciate it. I'm very nervous about it. Thank you.

Original Debs as in the Ukraine guy? No, original Debs. I'm assuming this is towards my answer of who had these previously, who I got them from, was the original Debs of the coin.

[Speaker 2]
Well, it's now multi-sig. We are working on that. Make Jeff invisible again.

Yes, we are working on the colors in there. You still jokingly refer to Grant as your son sometimes. Oh, I will stop.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, but I had to continue a lot while an investigation was going on. I hope you understand. I'm sure Sarah will sleep tonight with the release of all this dress.

You're so sweet. Thank you. I hope I can sleep tonight.

It has been very rough lately, very rough past few weeks. I appreciate that. I appreciate the kindness.

Thank you. Did Grant hire original Debs? I am not sure.

[Speaker 2]
I honestly do not remember ever communicating with anybody else, so I'm not sure.

[Speaker 1]
If we had an outstanding tradable flow of around 23 billion coins, then what will the approximate ballpark flow be after all the bills are paid? If you know, I do not know. If you want to DM me that, just so I don't lose it, I can get an answer for you.

So the Yuki came in after Grant's original Debs. Yes, so we have two different. So there are the Debs that started the coin, and then there are the Debs that were contractors.

[Speaker 2]
Sunlight is best disinfectant.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, absolutely. Finally, we have transparency. We have truth, and we are ready to start on a clean slate, and I hope you all agree, and I hope you're all ready to be force multipliers and make this coin go how it was intended to go.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. Any other questions?

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. I appreciate it. EasyFJB.

I appreciate that. I appreciate all the support. I was very nervous to share this information.

It has been very stressful. It's been amazing. Our contractors and everybody behind the scenes has been a huge help, doing all, people way, way, way smarter than me, doing everything they need to do while I really do the easy part.

So I'm sure this has been so much more stressful for everybody else, including our contractors. I know I have probably the easiest part of this, but again, I do apologize. I am so, so embarrassed.

I feel so stupid, and I feel so stupid for leading you all on, but it was in all honesty and what I knew at the time.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for the transparency. You're welcome. I've always been of the transparency since day one.

Thank you. You're welcome. Will the new team be able to lock the wallets that were skimming?

I'm not sure about that. I know we have no tax-free wallets left from old management. Okay.

I think that's all the questions. Thank you all so much for your support. I love you too, Raven.

That's all the questions. Hearing BNB are working tirelessly on FJB for months. Yes, recently.

[Speaker 1]
We will have more info on that. And then the BNB working tirelessly on FJB. Again, I can promise you that.

That was never a lie. I was on probably about half the chat with BNB. Due to legal reasons, I will not speak much on that.

When can we hear from BNB again?

[Speaker 2]
I am hoping that we can get them on before the end of the month. Sarah, do you have more frequent communication with BNB now?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, absolutely. Before, when I would message BNB and mostly Boris about certain things, I would be told to contact Grant regarding a lot of it. And then before that, Bar League.

[Speaker 2]
Bannon Monthly Investor Meeting.

[Speaker 1]
That's a good idea. Nice question. I'm not sure.

Did I miss your question? You need to stop apologizing. You've done nothing wrong.

And actually, that led to this. Thank you. It's been very, very stressful.

But again, my wallets are squeaky clean, as are my unwiped laptop and phone.

[Speaker 2]
Love to have my pillow Lindell to put in one million. Yes, would be. All right.

When's the next voice? We usually have a board on Friday night.

[Speaker 1]
I think we usually do PM Eastern. So we'll see what time it is this week. What's the debt amount?

I may have missed it. Right under 20k, I believe. Okay, SEC lawsuit against the LB.

No, we have so somebody's asking about the Let's Go Brandon coin. No, we have. Does it affect FGB?

No, we have documents. Boris, of course, being an attorney, we do have documents that would protect us from that. As far as I know.

When Jackbox bring back Jackbox. Let's make that a thing again. I need to get a code now.

An FGB promo code at least for the my pillows.

[Speaker 2]
That'd be cool. I have like 20 my pillows in my house. Okay, is it safe to say the as shown in the roadmap white paper?

[Speaker 1]
Now? Are we still moving forward on pace despite the investigation? Yes, absolutely.

But I hope everybody understands that it is going to take just a little bit of time and I'll keep you updated on everything. We're already cleaning up. Okay.

I'm already working on the Google app update to get the Google or app back on the Google Play Store. We are already getting bills paid. We are already making amends with the community as far as honesty, transparency isn't having a plan.

So of course, it'll just be a little bit of cleanup before we start all over on a fresh ship. Friday night by FGB coin mega night. Yes, I think telegram needs to bring that into discord.

Actually, telegram started an FGB coin mega night that's kind of like a happy hour, where I don't know if they still have an amount but everybody basically just buys a little bit of FGB coins and it's been awesome. All right, I think that is everything. I think that's all the questions.

I'll be in the chat. As always, I want to thank you again for your patience with me. And I hope you accept my genuine apology and the truth always comes out.

[Speaker 2]
Be good guys.
