[Speaker 1]
Happy Friday. I hope everybody's doing well. I hope you've had a great week.

I just hopped on for a little bit of an update in case you haven't been in Telegram. I think we've mentioned it in there. I thought I had it up to...

The music was going. It must have stopped. So, sorry about that.

I'm hearing myself. So, the devs have started. So, we should have a pretty major update for you all.

It's definitely going to be this month. I'll let you know as soon as I can. Hopefully, is audio good on your end?

I don't know why. Okay, hopefully it's good for you guys because I can hear myself. So, yes, definitely.

Unless something crazy happens. Devs, third parties. We should definitely be done with the major update by the end of the month and have it ready to share with you.

I will keep you updated if that somehow changes. Countdown from five to make sure. Good.

Awesome. So, yeah, pretty big update. Super excited about it.

And we'll keep you updated. B&B are super excited about it. We're just all excited to get moving and get some momentum going.

But that's all, really. Just that finally going. And a pretty good deal.

Do you know if the fsvr will function yet? Fixed? No.

They have started work. Nothing has been completed yet to my knowledge. Thanks for hanging out with me.

What? What are we talking about? Are they using a test environment?

I'm not sure if that's being used yet or the details of that. But I know in the plan was for them to be using a test environment. I do remember that.

Can you give us a little clue what the tax is? I'll update you on that as soon as I possibly can. I promise.

Thanks, Tickle. Sorry, I'm not trying to be secretive. We're just learning as we keep going with this.

I just don't want to give you answers that may change. You may have covered this already. I just can't remember.

Is the work the devs are doing the task? Yes. I usually have pretty good luck with Amazon, but I use their chat function.

I've tried to call them, but that was a while ago. The major task, any clue on that? Unfortunately, not anything more than I've said.

Has the URL for the new name been purchased? There's not an update on that from the last time we spoke, which is the name has been decided on 95%. So if we do go with that name, then yes.

I'm sorry, Ed. I promise I'm not trying to be secretive. I just don't want to give you information that may change.

I think once we get going here, we'll have a lot of information to share with you, which will be amazing. Is Wed getting any info before us for his other butt cheeks? No.

Maybe we should. We'll update him with the logo before everybody else so we can announce it like that. We'll have to get it approved by Boris, though, because you saw how he reacted to the last tattoo.

URLs. How many names in the running? More than two, I want to say.

Purchase all URLs? No. Narn's so needy.

What running shoes? I remember you had the one fancy leather shoes that you love so much. Thanks, Ed.

I'd really like to share more, but I'm kind of trying to keep as many people happy as possible. I don't want to give you guys any wrong info or hype anything up until it's decided on. I'm sure we'll still run into downfalls and miss the mark sometimes.

Shopping has gotten harder and harder as more brands have come off my list. Drain the Swamp Queen? Not a terrible idea, is that her new name?

What's missing is the music. If you're a Bailey Zimmerman fan, his album just came out so I was listening to that a little bit earlier. I feel like I should have eaten bacon right before this, for whatever reason.

The roadmap that was released. Do you think we'll meet those milestones, considering where we are now? We will update that as soon as we have some of the bigger tasks completed, because we would like that to be as accurate as possible for you all.

And again, even the devs are saying we should have no problem meeting this timeline by the end of the month, but I'm just afraid to share that with how everything else is gone. I just don't want to jinx that. But I am very excited and I feel great about it.

That does look like Manon. Is that Moe or his wife right there? It's not a brunette, so it can't be gray.

Oh yeah, in browser it looks to me. Let me zoom in. Man, it's even better then.

I should send that to him and see what comment he has. Tickle my fancy, please. It's changing their name again for the launch.

What are you changing your name to? FJB Babby says, when do you think the tasks will complete? And you can divulge everything we have been waiting for.

Definitely by the end of the month from what the devs are saying. But I will keep you updated. Is there someone overseeing the devs?

Yes. After work is done, will they be locked out? If you mean not having access to everything?

Yes, of course. Why are you so mean to him? He has a girlfriend.

She's pretty hot. Quack's girlfriend. Most of you have really attractive, significant others.

Some of you, I'm not sure how you pulled it off. Kidding. Can't say diet.

Is this called a personality? My statement still stands. Kidding.

So, we hope to have some big changes this weekend as the devs continue working. I will update you with anything that I can update you with if it's in between voice chats from this point forward, as always. If you need anything else, please let me know.

Please remember, don't give your seed phrase to anybody, including admins or myself. Any kind of support, trust wallet support, LBank support, anything like that. Nobody should ask you for that.

Your seed phrase. Also, don't enter it into any sketchy links. I think that's all.

Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions, or just tag me in chat. Ed says, Tuesday call again? Yes.

Telegram, always for the Tuesday voice calls. Discord, always for the Friday ones. And yeah, I hope it's a big month for us.

Finally get some momentum going moving forward, and from there edit the roadmap accordingly and keep going. I'm super excited. I'm trying to keep calm because I don't want to overhype anything, but I really do feel really, really, really good about this, and I'm excited to finally get moving.

So, on that note, I hope you all have a wonderful night. I didn't cook today, so I'll make my husband take me out to dinner. But yeah, I'll be on my phone, and I'll update the recording right now with a few bullet points.

You all have a wonderful night.
