[Speaker 1]
All right, I hope everybody's had a great week. Ooh, several DMs, so we'll get back to you right after the voice chat. Looks like there's no questions in there.

Yeah, I hope everybody's had a great week. We've had a pretty productive week. Everybody is still working.

And everything's going as expected, so far, so good. I will let you know if anything does come up. So far, nothing has come up.

I'm just getting updates that everything's still going as it should, which is great news. That's definitely well good. And that's it, the website is complete.

We'll probably just wait to actually go live, probably just this weekend. But that's exciting, very, very cool. Yeah, that's it, that's all I have.

Well, nothing else to update with, really. Let's see. Yes, I am recording.

Can you tease any information on the marketing group company you mentioned a few voice chats ago? Are they a political or crypto marketing firm? Um, I will update you guys on that when I can.

They are not a crypto marketing firm, though. Oh, you didn't really miss anything, Ed. Everything's just going as it should be, which is great news.

Nothing unexpected has popped up. So, so far, so good. That's the news we love to hear.

We're still on track. Yeah, that's it, as far as that goes. Third party, any communication?

We are still waiting for them, yes. We spoke, or I spoke to them yesterday, Thursday. I'll see you as soon as I have an idea.

I haven't got a new chair, and I love it, except that it makes this weird noise. Maybe something isn't tightened correctly. I tend to have a pedic chair.

Just need it not to squeak. Do you expect them to have started within the next seven days? So, I am not sure, but I will update you as soon as I have an update.

I'd be lying if I honestly had an answer for you there. Do remember to take your coins off XD if you still have them there, please. I know there was a scammer, Sarah, in there.

In the Discord this week, so, as always, please don't send any money or give your seed to anybody, including me or the other admins. It's very likely that it's not one of us. So, just be careful with that.

Oh, that was on your first minute, Ed. The website is complete. We will probably launch this weekend.

It looks very clean, a bit more professional. The expectation communicated to us last week was that they would start within two, this is regarding the third party, that they would start within two weeks. Has that drifted?

No, that has not changed. If that does change, since it is depending on a timeline, if it does change, I will let you know. Would be good to push through the logo changes to the App Store.

So, the logo changes and the name need to be pushed through the Patriot Pay, need to be pushed through the App Stores, however, to do that, we need the LLC under the new name. And we are waiting to do that until task is complete. Basically, just legal details there.

Once task is live, LLC will officially be filed once we have that, that's when we can push it through the App Store under that new name, along with the logos. Task live, when no more reindeer, reindeer, games? I don't get it.

Trust me, nobody wants task live sooner than I do. Not one person, I don't think. Yeah, it's gotta be done right.

That I'm excited for. Oh yeah, the website looks really cool. And of course, we'll add more on there as everything, as we continue transitioning.

So, any businesses on board yet? I'm assuming this is for Patriot Pay. We actually had several people inquire about that, several people, business owners.

We are waiting for something to get approved on the back end, a promotional deal to offer the first applicants. But nobody, no applications or approval yet, but we are super excited for that. Yeah, we got several inquiries within the first 12, 24 hours.

The extra add-on that was made to the task, has that been completed? I'm assuming the one we, or the one I shared on the last voice? No, that's being worked on, that has not been completed.

The last update I got to that was this morning. Everything going as expected there, so that's what I'm expecting. It'll save us a ton of time in the future, so.

That'll be nice. Speed up the timelines. That's really a lot of what has been added on to the task and it's taken so long.

There are really a lot of long-term features. Because time was not the number one priority, and just getting this completed was not the number one priority, and actually the one priority being everything we can to give us the highest chance of success long-term. So I think most of you will be very pleased for the well-thought-out features.

So third party will wait until the work has been completed prior to their execution of the task. That's my understanding, yes. Yes.

I did get a few DMs asking about admins. Yes, admins and both, and moderators in both Telegram and Discord are available to help you, and they just make sure it's not a scammer. They don't ask for your seed phrase or ask you to send them money, but yes, they are all very helpful and are involved with information.

So basically, yes, you can trust them, but again, don't give them your seed phrase or click on any strange links from them or send them money, or me. Tell her to have to work overtime. We have, we have, gosh, how many people now working?

I'm trying. I thought some dev might be working on it, too. Give me something to do.

Our main dev has a 9.27 a.m. my time, said I'm still working on it. I'll let you know when it's completed. Is there any way around the 8,800 minimum to transfer out of XT?

No, there is not, but honestly, that's so little. Probably just swap your coins if it's just a tiny bit that you have in there. Let me know if you have any issues moving your coins out of XT.

Tag, DM, or email me so we can get you taken care of there. Gosh, is everybody getting COVID across the country? I have so many people here.

I'm getting it again. I guess so, if you think of it that way. Just Google Trump rally schedule, and the first thing that pops up is an article from ABC.

Donald Trump's 2024 campaign, fewer rallies, more court cases. So to close, just a quick summary of what you're hoping for this week. I'm hoping for everything to continue going smoothly with no hiccups.

Please, baby Jesus, send all the prayers you can there because that's been smooth sailing, which is wonderful news. The white paper is getting very close to completion, especially now that we're in the pretty final, final, final stages, so there's not really a ton of changes happening. Yeah, the 2024 campaign will be legendary.

What happens when one of these third parties decides to not cooperate with us anymore? Will we just be at their mercy moving forward? No, not at all.

The third parties just give us a platform and just make things easier for us. It's basically like I say right now, but no, not at all. I mean, if third parties decided to drop us, there are ways around that, and we'd find them, but it's a lot less costly this way and a lot easier for everybody.

As all these features that sometimes seem very basic on the front end cost a ton and require a ton of licensing and just a ton more than, but the third parties we're working with have been absolutely amazing, and we're definitely grateful for that. And then those savings with the negotiations we've made with them will definitely help our voters in the long haul and obviously decline. What's the likelihood of task reveal in September?

Well, we're under, we still, it's what, September 15th, so we still have another two weeks, and so far, praying that does not change, so far everything's gone smoothly, but you all know how it's gone the last few months where it's that end part that's really, a lot of the times, sometimes stuff hasn't gone as expected in the beginning or middle of the assigned work, but I think more recently that's all happened at the very end with testing, and testing doesn't go as expected, and the devs have to go back and rework everything.

Security is a high, high, high priority, extremely high priority, so this is why the testing is critical and everything needs to go perfectly during testing, and I know it sucks when testing doesn't go as expected, and for us to wait while devs have to go back and figure it out, but we can't afford not to have everything as secure as we possibly can. So as of right now, I think we can still be done and revealed in September, but that's if everything goes as expected, including testing. More tax sales coming.

We'll probably have a few more before we go live. Let's see, what is, has B&B done anything? With the app, will you just be able to enter your credit card info and simply buy it?

Will it have all the VESS bullshit again? It's confusing. Yes, so having VESS is just for security purposes, right?

We imagine the bigger we get, the more of a security threat, more of a target we'd be, so that's why VESS is there, but we are having VESS simplify as much as they can. We are working on that with them because I realize it is confusing. I tried to go through the app the other day just to get the experience of a new user, and I think it's just, like a part of it, I think it's just a lot of words.

Honestly, like it's just, and most people aren't gonna read all that, so I get that there, I understand, and we are working with the VESS founders to simplify that. Obviously, security is very, very important, but we also don't want it to be too complicated, and it has gotten a lot easier, I think, since we first started as far as resetting and just sending a pin to your email. I think that's a lot easier.

I did try that again than what it used to be, but even the wording there is confusing. I had to do it like three times before I realized because I wasn't reading it. I was just quickly scanning and going, and finally, I saw that you actually have to click on something, and it's not very clear.

That's honestly what's nice is all, most of the companies that we work with are also startups, have been so amazing to us because they're also growing, too, so they realize with all the BS we've gone through, and we've gotten lucky to work with some great third parties, if you will. Yeah, my sister was telling me about that, about MGM and Caesars. Getting hacked, why?

I can't believe they paid them. I mean, I understand why, but I feel like that's just kind of enabling it, not that I'm any sort of expert on that stuff. Late to the voice chat.

How is app fixes coming? As expected so far. As you all know, it's been a bit more difficult because just the way we kind of received everything from the old team, but everything is going as expected.

The last I heard about that was this morning around 9.30 a.m., but it's still being worked on. Way to get fixed on the app is those boom transactions. Hopefully it's something simple like it has in the past, but I'm sure we'll find out if not.

I think that's everything. Let me get to the few of you on here asking for help, it seems. But I think that's all the questions.

I don't think I missed any. If you do need anything, please feel free to tag, DM, or email me. Other than that, if you have coins on XT, please transfer them out to Trust Wallet or MetaMask.

If you need help with that, feel free to reach out so we can take care of you and get your coins off XT. I think that's everything for now. Let me know if you guys need anything else.

Yeah, I think that's everything. Might need your help. I don't know.

We'll see, voting on a few items that we want to have that are in person events. So I might need your help with that just to get a vote on everything. See what the majority likes.

Yeah, hope you all have a good night. I will be here if I do get any updates before Tuesday. I for sure will share them in announcements on both channels.

That's everything. Just waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting. Very excited, more than any of you.

Trust me to be done waiting. But again, I think trying to do everything the best we possibly can for the highest chance of success and I think you'll see how well thought out everything was. I think there will be very, most of you, some of you I just, some of you I just don't think I can ever make happy.

But most of you I think. So all right, you guys have a good night. I'll see you in general chat and then I'll get back to the two, two I think DMs right now.
