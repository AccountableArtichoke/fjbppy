(0:00 - 1:40:51)
There were the merchant wallets, the VIP wallets, that's huge. The function on there, it took a lot of work when we were moving the timeline up again and again and well pushing it back further was a lot of it was because the dev had to get all these functions which was not an easy job to do on what ended up being Matic and then getting so the VIP wallets that's a big deal because that really will push that gives merchants a I think an upper hand because you you know they you guys can pay them in pay tray pay but then so that's a huge deal because then sorry hold on it's really hard for me to speak when I'm hearing voices yeah I got you MJ I don't know why it's not I think it's something to do with our new channel I don't think the mods can do it either so it's still trying to get everything set up on our new server I think no okay is everybody muted no everybody's not muted trying to mute everybody so it's really difficult for me to talk and I keep hearing okay is that everybody everybody's muted okay so going back the video most of the features I think are outlined in there we just had to fit it in a few minutes but I think the most important well some of the most important ones were definitely the VIP wallets so that's a big deal because getting that feature added on there where you pay in Patriot pay and the merchant receives it and we can actually change but stable coin we can change what stable coin they receive it in I think that's a huge deal of course there's also different taxes for merchant transfers so a holder to a versus a holder to a holder and versus just the buying and selling tax that's all different now we're on the old contract you know the buy tax equal the sell tax equal the transfer tax that's a huge deal and the dev worked super hard to get that on Matic we have to change around a few things that was one of the features that took a lot of the time and a lot of just moving the timeline so seems like it's not sorry about that we'll make sure to fix that so that's a big deal when I met with so I met with Steve a few times during TPUSA and it was everything I I mean it was so much better than I ever imagined we met up actually every day that I was there which I didn't go I think it was the first day but I couldn't make it I got stuck at an appointment but Steve is super excited he just needs us to have everything working correctly he is genuinely super excited about it he is a little bit sad about the FJV because he really does love the FJV and I did actually I think on the last day Russ says discord is like Fox News actually I gotta see who's all in there in a second let me share this first let me share had Steve film hey so he is really sad about the FJV because he really really liked that but I think this was this may have been the last day on the way to our last meeting a few seconds to play that one yeah I do think Stacey I think it's I think it's our fault actually or my fault I think the new server looks like everybody's muted on my end mayhem I have the Patriot pay list that I shared on here that people added music on so yeah I think that was one of the songs that somebody added or had on the list should we just regroup in 15 I can wait sure what the hell let's figure out the settings hold on give me a second I think who is taught I can't hear anybody but apparently you guys can is that better you did you can still hear them now they're muted okay we're gonna hold on give me a second sorry guys let's see hello I wasn't talking so maybe that's why you didn't hear me can you hear me now Russ says he doesn't hear me I hope we don't have to change what the chant or what the whole server is let's see if Russ can hear yeah I think wag I think the way we have the server set up I think we'd have to change that as a whether it's community or not so it doesn't give me that option actually is everybody good now though are we still hearing people okay all good cool so did everybody oh shoot I should probably pin those videos there's this one let's pin that okay so we got the announcement video everybody got time to watch that we got this even though Steve is sad about FJB leaving and he wanted to speak to everybody who didn't who didn't let us in in their events using FJB start over from the beginning well there's okay cool yeah well we'll work on that so that has that's something to do with a new server I think we have I think we'll have to set it up as a community server to get that option but we'll look into that okay cool so going back we have the announcement video super excited about all the features of the contract that the team worked very very hard on that's a lot of what took a lot of the extra time a lot of the features I mean we've not I mean every single feature there's no contract out there that we know of with features like this it took a really long time and a lot of creativity from both our team and our dev we kept trying you know like Uniswap version 2 versus version 3 and you know that doesn't work with USD USDT and then you have this option but you know if you want this and our team wanted all the options and even though it took a lot more time we got every single feature that we wanted which is super exciting down to the proxy so we've already made changes to the contract that don't require a fork which is really really cool and I think will continue to be a crypto and contract app everything in general that honestly has not been done before and what will set us and continue to set us apart from everybody else so will you add PPY and discord like FJB what do you mean let's see who else is here I've seen some names I haven't seen in a while free bird 45 I've seen you oh we have oh as far as airdrops I know I'm getting a lot of DMS all of you special cases we have gone through most of you most of you should have received a transfer that we did manually after the airdrop what we did was the automatic airdrop that we use bulk sender for to make sure everything was super smooth we paid a pretty penny for that and I think it was well worth it a lot of you appreciated it got plenty of tags and DMS of this being a very smooth airdrop which I'm glad we did that then we did the manual transfers for all you special cases but we still have a few more so if you are I know there's a few people that have DMS I think I've gotten back to most of you you are still we have one probably hopefully we can get you all in one more block of manual transfers to get you all your correct coins so hold tight we will get that to you if you do have a smart wallet we decided not to airdrop your coins one you can't access them right now anyway through the app but to just to keep your coins safe just so because there's been a few of you that have not followed directions gotten in the app and find found a way to lose your coins so if you really if you really really really want them I can go ahead and send them to you I highly do not recommend that but that will be the batch that we manually transfer once app is complete so so I guess there's at least two more batches coming of manual transfers but I think the vast majority of you should have received your coins and your correct coins so I'm glad everybody's happy there let's see I still have not received an airdrop hmm I haven't seen your name and DM so if that's the case then DM me when you DM me make sure you include your FJB wallet not your seed phrase your public wallet address go ahead and send that over okay oh do remind me to check will somebody check price in four minutes okay who else let's see a Kia offers glory if you have your regulars but a few of you I haven't seen before lots of Bob's I didn't realize we had so many Bob's probably because my bird loves Bob who was her owner for 36 years seafood haven't seen that one in a while dawn decentralized you've been around a kite dog bone drk Edwin easy patriot Barkis fizz another Bob we have four Bob's just on tonight general Gen X golden rocks Jeff Roger molds Gen P Jeremy JL young J max J rock heaven crazy trucker who haven't seen you in a while liquid masa mayhem MJ moku lots of you going down the peas ours awesome good to see everybody a lot okay what is what is TW trust wallet yes so do those airdrops also go to trust wallet or just FJB app both so if you had coins in the FJB app you will get those however if you do have the smart wallet we're holding off to airdrop those to you if you really want them I can go ahead and transfer those to you but a few of you have found some ways to get yourselves in trouble so but if you do have an expert wallet you can still get to trust wallet enter your keys there and still have access to those I know plenty of you have done that Bobby says he's the only real Bobby maybe because for me you're from Arizona I guess you can go back what glad to be back you've never left what white paper will be released this week we've had some changes we have some really exciting changes that you all have asked for as far as the app goes super super that'll help simplify the app even further as far as start this is what Steve has asked for right so as far as generating an account wallet on there initially and then a lot of you are having trouble when you get new devices to get back into your account so we'll get that problem solved for you and make it super easy and continue continue working on that what happens if I have both wallet original and smart wallet on the app then you have then you should have gotten the airdrop for your expert wallet and then the smart wallet balance you'll get airdrop to you as soon as the apps ready PPY app ready I will keep you updated on that we do want to make sure just like the fork that we get it a hundred percent right will we be able to send tokens to other smart wallets without a tax or fee like when we use pay to pay to pay a merchant not right now but that is something we're definitely working on as volume increases we will start lowering tax that's the plan and I think most of you holders will probably but I've been here for a while probably benefit from that you added this song when war room war room as soon as the app is ready and you all test it and we stress test it to make sure the app can handle 1,500 users in an hour like we did last time around and this time we have confirmed that all the partners we're working with are very MAGA friendly or at least at least tolerant that we're not gonna get canceled so very excited about that when chime says they don't have sound when is the burn the burn will be after everybody gets paid out which is we anticipate the last of that batch will be the smart wallet users just to make sure that everybody is set and it's exactly where they were at the time of snapshot I've also got a few messages from you guys today who are you know who think they've not received your coins but do remember if you didn't have coins at snapshot that you will not receive or you should not receive any Patriot pay coins but you can always buy them while prices low ETA for app community testing is as soon as I can't give you a time I'd be lying if I gave you a time right now but as soon as it's ready we'll probably the team will probably test it for a day or two depending on how that testing goes I'm assuming it goes well we'll have you guys test it right after yeah who's the winner did you guys check somebody check the contest channel that wag with this construction hat to mayhem says no like when the app is functional will we be able to send Patriot pay back and forth through the app to other app users without a processing fee or tax no tax will still apply on wallet to wallet transfers but that will the plan is transfers will probably be the first transaction to see a lower tax I'll definitely let you know if that changes but that's the plan I know a lot of you want to get your wallets consolidated too although I don't know that that's a good idea but a few of you want to move them to cold wallets to cold storage has it been determined yet what the approximate circulating supply will be ballpark I think it should be as of now it should be fairly close to where we were at with FGB but I will I'll definitely keep you updated on that we do have to get everybody paid yeah what steps are being taken to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Patriot pay program I think mostly honestly getting everything done correctly which was a lot of cleaning up some of what we had before which is what took longer not only were we starting from scratch but I feel like you know how sometimes it takes longer to clean up something that was already there versus just starting over obviously we couldn't do that for a few of the reasons but I think I think we're showing that just even with the a lot of the functions of the new contract which I know you guys don't like sometimes can you because it is taking longer than you all expect but I think you just have to look at it from a different perspective where we are looking at building something long term that will really make an impact versus just getting something I think it would be very easy and I think it'd be easier for all of us especially me and probably the devs and the team to do something that is you know will pump for the next week or the next month but we are doing things a lot differently and I know sometimes that's not as exciting but in the long run I think everybody who sticks around will win I think that's for the best interest of the coin and the holders and future holders and we'll continue keeping that as the number one priority can we buy PPY yet or do we need to wait what where have you been Akia yes you can buy PPY there's a few different YouTube tutorials too if you need those I will be adding a few more tonight if you don't use Trust Wallet I'll be adding the MetaMask and I'll be adding another Trust Wallet for Polygon Portal and another MetaMask for Polygon Portal feel free to DM me if you use something else and I can walk you through that too when will B&B get their wallets so B&B actually may be creating new wallets in case their wallets have been compromised so as soon as they get new wallets we'll be sending them their coins they're very excited for that they've been asking when when when fork so or when airdrop I hate that guy who are we hating? Legg says he didn't douche yeah that's a problem you don't ever douche isn't that why your girlfriends always yelling at you hot asian girlfriend I don't know how you all get like hot wives and girlfriends maybe just being conservative when Legg PPY tat on other cheek rude Legg says the logo isn't nearly as fun Sarah what triggers an add to the LP I've only seen like two to three worth maybe one to two hundred dollars even with $100,000 volume I'm trying to think of percentages off the top of my head but that shouldn't be the case so the way we have it set up right now is in the contract we have a like you guys saw in the video too we have an auto swap feature where we can turn that on or off and what that will do is instead of the coins going straight you know you make a purchase and you buy $100 $8 of that is tax and the old contract that would automatically go to the what was the marketing and charity wallet got the five and the three that would go there and be sent there with each transaction the difference now is we have the auto swap the team auto swap feature with that will do if it's turned on is we can then set a amount that it swaps at so right now we have that at a million coins so you make a purchase for $100 $8 goes into this the contract but it does not get sent to the what now is our operations and community and charity wallet sits there until it reaches a total of a million PPI once every and again we can change that million we can go ahead and get that lower or higher however whatever we set it out okay once it reaches that one what we have right now 1 million PPI is then where it distributes it distributes it to what we have set right now which is 1% to the LP what was it 1% to charity and community and then the other 6% to operations so you've you probably just haven't seen it because it's harder to tell it'll be on the chart it'll be triggered after it reaches that it needs at least a minimum of a thousand PPI but that way we don't have to make cells in larger chunks and it automatically just does it and it'll help keep the chart a little bit more stable so the downside is you'll see a little bit more cells on the charts especially if you have higher volume then we're gonna reach that million coins a little quicker but it will be helpful for everyone because it's a lot more gradual and it's not you know before if we needed to build and we need to suddenly go ahead and sell you know I don't know 50 million coins or what-have-you so that'll again I think that works out better for everybody and that 1% to LP I think has been very underrated so far I thought you guys would be a little bit a lot more excited for that that's huge when do B&B get new wallets and when burnt are you not listening I think you typed that probably before I answered like says time for someone someone else to put there on the line for you people I know some of your kids listen so I need to watch my mouth I've got in the DMS of all the cute kids but I thought about that after I was like oh my gosh what if I said I hope I haven't said any bad words what's a plan to onboard merchants how does one sign up we will get you all updated on that and the education portion also I think that's gonna be a huge deal especially for our target audience geez not safe for work Bob any business owners in here going to take PPI payments we have gotten several inquiries actually super excited about that really excited about having a PPI marketplace straight on the app I think this will also be great for any of you even with you know even with little like small side businesses when I know it's just speaking to one of you today who's on Etsy and I've heard I've never sold on Etsy but I've heard that they take quite a huge chunk from your revenue and I think that'll be great for all of you we also have a really really big partner partnership I don't know if that's a name coming up we'll probably announce we will announce definitely before the end of the month but might be more like in the next week or two that I think most of you would probably be really excited about like I'm not getting a tattoo weg sorry oh my gosh now I know why wigs well I already knew why wigs girlfriends are always pissed at him Russ says we've waited three years to see our president to be properly seated very excited about that thanks Steve and Boris are all very excited about that too I think I think if we could even get like one truth from the big guy well should now I don't know my best key do you have you have your keys your seed phrase that'll work too what is polygon portal I wrote it seems like polygon portal might not work in a lot of the states where a lot of you live but for me it's been a lot easier than quick swap I get a lot less errors on there so at least if you're in Arizona um if you have issues with quick swap then I highly recommend polygon portal so it's just another so and a lot of you have asked this so quick swap is just the equivalent to how pancake swap that's where we bought FJB before right so now being on or off the Binance smart chain we can't we can't buy PPY on pancake swap so now it's on quick swap so it's just the equivalent in that sense of pancake swap the same way you all used to open trust wallet and open pancake swap in there that's all quick swap is and then polygon portal is just another option but again a few of you have said that that's not an option for you when you open it up it doesn't let you buy PPY on there but for me it's been a lot easier we will make sure to post the tutorials by the end of the night question regarding the video if people accept tether at their business we can automatically use PatriotPay at that business even though they don't accept PatriotPay so I think they'd I'm not sure about that actually I will make sure to get you a better answer but what I'm understanding right now is they I think they would have to oh maybe not I'll get you a better answer from an expert on that because I am not but if they if they accept whatever it would have to be the same stable coin that we currently have our PPY swap to I think but I will double-check on that because I am NOT the expert there Wegg said no no no she's always yelling at me because she isn't doing and the laundry don't get done okay hard to believe I don't know hard to believe can we still tip yes you can still tip actually I need to you all right now and the tip CC dev is working on that they had to wait until we dropped but I expect that to be live pretty soon where it'll show up as PPY so we can slowly but surely get rid of that your your FJB tips will turn into PPY as soon as they make that make that change so don't worry about that oh it's not it's not working too oh no there you go somebody wasn't doing it right correctly I thought that maybe while they're working on everything it didn't work yeah I can't remember those commands either it's been so long super exciting okay what oh that's a nice buy who was that we need Patriot pay accepted here stickers yes absolutely oh by the way if you want some bumper stickers go ahead and order those off the website right so the only reason DM me if you don't you know DM me if you just want stickers sent to you the only reason we put that $3 on there is just so that we don't have spammers abuse that and send those stickers everywhere but if you want bumper stickers you don't need to pay the $3 and shipping you can just go ahead and DM me again the only reason we did that was really just to prevent spammers from spamming our site and using all the stickers that you guys probably could use either way DM me or there's also the link on the website be your first PPI purchase I just use coin base wallet to purchase Matic and then swap Matic to PPI with 90% slippage set nice nice to see mayhem back ultra suede says please just start a DM thread with tipsy see to check your balance from now on yes you can DM I used to DM them a ton for to ask certain questions and this get the settings all figured out or we can we can also me I mean it's easier to DM but we can also make a channel if you all I feel like that defeats the purpose because if you know to use that channel you can use plugins to accept PPI could you explain the benefit of adding to the LP so well I can give you a more technical answer but what adding to the LP is so every time somebody purchases that's adding to the LP so by taking a percentage of every tax dollar that would usually go to just the marketing or which is now our marketing is now our operations wallet and what used to be our charity is now charity and community management so we can not only give to charity and charitable causes but also back to you the community and what that LP would do is also give a percentage of that back into the LP so that goes towards the liquidity pool which would essentially help the value of the coin because that's add even though it seems like 1% it's pretty low it's going to be added as a value to the liquidity pool which will help in the price of the coin the value of the coin I guess but if you need a more detailed answer I can give you that are there instructions on how the tip thing works yes if you tip see tips or I'm sorry if you DM tip CC you'll see all the instructions there everyone going thumbs up now yeah coin so coin market cap needs to update our listing from FGB to Patriot pay but I think that having our trading disabled for a little bit kind of messed with that so if you do give us a thumbs up that would help but or I think our volume in the next few days should definitely help with that nice thank you WCG 420 I wish those make me very sleepy Winster tech audit so an audit we did have an internal audit which we don't really plan on releasing because the purpose of an audit is really I think more of a marketing ploy kind of like locking the LP and especially a contract like ours where I feel like in a sense we run more like a business in that sense we're definitely not your typical crypto so when we did the internal audit our goal was more to ensure they all the functions were functioning as intended which was a huge deal make sure there's no security risks that would put you the holders at risk or any of course of the funds that you've all worked very hard for at risk so yeah I don't I'm not sure we'd ever be getting one with certic I think it defeats the purpose because there are features about our contract that would pop up again it's just like locking the LP that would pop up as a huge red flag where to us Steve Boris or I have a lot more to lose than say rug pulling the community or say with the proxy you know there's pros and cons like most things in the world and exactly like the proxy edition that gives us the huge benefit of that is that we can make contract modifications without having to fork again which is a huge pain in the ass for excuse me for all of you but what was I saying you you guys is all your kids drawings now I'm like so so hopefully no kids around hopefully it's too late for all you all on the East Coast so Wow going back to what I was saying so example like lock in that the LP is generally a huge function right of a crypto coin well to us we like when we were going to lock the LP back a little bit over a year ago actually we ended up not doing so because the well I kind of had a mini heart attack because when we came to transfer the LP back to the contract owner and to the LP owner we couldn't find the website was down for the service where deep lock at the time where the LP was locked out and and that service seems to be down now so with everything happening in the crypto space that's a risk we're not willing to take and I think it's safer for us and safer for the community to not go ahead and lock the LP with a third party that might just disappear and I think the same goes with an audit where oh that's what I was saying actually before my potty mouth so with the like the example being the proxy edition that gives us a huge one up and that's actually what also took a ton of time to get that added to our contract but we've already made a few changes that have really been great and to help the smart contract work that the way it's supposed to into the app but there's also risks because if you're dealing with a scammy owner of the contract or somebody who has access to the contract and a dishonest person of course there are ways that they can use that in a not so positive way but I think for our purpose and what kind of contract and coin and organization and community we're building I think that works well for us so sorry long long answer there or one question let's see goodness you guys are typing so fast I don't think I'm gonna need to shorten my answers seven seven seven what are you guys trying to do maybe they'll get rid of our curses our FJB curse when your crush tells you to move your shoes when you come to her house oh that's funny that took me a little bit it's like my parents house take your shoes off for nerfing I don't know let's see I'm reading through but holy smokes you guys going fast yeah some people are having issues with quick swap a few of you emailed me today and I think we got it resolved just upping your slippage that seems to help I think that's been the majority of everybody no I do want to clarify about that kind of on my statements that I've made a few times in the chat just to clarify so I don't get any of you so none of you get in trouble with any other coins so I want to correct myself so slippage I've told you all before I'm not the most patient person so generally when I have a transaction I just put a really high slippage to get it to go through so I've told you all that go ahead and put it as high as you're comfortable with because it's only going to use what what it's planning to use and you know if you set it at 50 it's not going to use 50% just because you set it at that if that makes sense but I do want to clarify that that's only the case because our because Patriot Pay now has the tax of 8% so that might and and of course the price is moving with volume a little bit quicker right now but that might not be the case with other coins so I do want to share that just in case mayhem says he thinks he he thinks he deserves a hundred million ppy for that sure actually you know what let's no let's wait till we have actual PPI I was gonna tip a few of you but I think we need PPI instead of FJD first then we'll do that it's not letting me deposit anymore coinbase wallet shows PPI price screw trust all last time I was stirring the ice in my drink Russ asked me if it was pooper chips you know you're lucky kids are listening right now Perry you were you're very very lucky I would have some words I have some words but all the cute drawings I get from all of your cute kids I just can't but I'll let somebody else type it out how about that there sorry I made up for it oh somebody somebody asked for this song I've never heard it before and it's called Trump won by Natasha Owens am I the only person that hasn't heard this Oh Perry somebody gave you an emoji reaction that that's what I was gonna say except not a you and off but you know thank the cute kids for keeping me in line shout out to the mods and admins very helpful yes the mods and admins keep everything running on the front end the team keeps everything running on the back end they are everything super appreciate them Sarah shame the seller today oh who's the seller I don't know but no don't shame on there's a lot of people looking for discounts I'm sure they appreciated it I know Russ was looking for a discount Russ says it's a big song I don't know how I've heard it before mayhem says don't watch it now this is an adult discord community if parents don't like it they can show their kids no they're cute kids and I really shouldn't be a potty mouth been working on that it's one of my New Year's New Year's resolutions to not be a potty mouth do you ever read like texts or stuff you've like written before and then you just cringe at it that's me like all the time but then I did read something that's like if you do that that actually means like that's a good thing that means you do a lot of growth and improvements like okay well that makes me feel better I just feel like reading back on my texts and stuff no matter what it is I could be stuffed with my best friend it seems like I'm like so dramatic which is which is funny for me because I'm like especially in person I'm very like much the person in the background and definitely not like in the animated part I'm like a super super quiet person so it's funny when I do read my text I'm like wow that seems like that's somebody that's super dramatic and like loud yeah I haven't seen General in a while good to see you I know Ed said he was working so he couldn't be here so he said to make sure to get a recording for him he's very sad about that oh I wonder if he got to see the video Ed was trying to convince me to send him the video early the launch video 24% 24.9 actually super nice yeah so the big thing we're waiting on big thing I'm waiting on that Steve is waiting on is really to get the app in perfect shape and we have to stress test it to be able to handle the volume so that's our number one priority right now now that you all have gotten or most of you have got in your coins those of you again who haven't as soon as we actually I think I have one transfer going out tonight but we will get those coins out to you ASAP so that you have them if you do have a smart wallet again if you really really want those coins go ahead and DM me and I can go ahead and transfer those to you but I highly advise against it actually we'll probably probably have you sign a contract that you take responsibility for that just because it's really not a good idea again just because some of you have we should we should put you on the team you found like ways to get things done that we've not expected so but if you really do want your funds your PPY that was that is in smart wallet like the FGB was then do let me know we don't want to hold your coins hostage or anything like that but our number one priority right now is to get the app functioning and to get so our devs already completed I think we spoke about this on the last voice chat and I told you I'd give you more details on it our dev has already completed the work we've already gotten the contract for it the reason I haven't signed the contract yet is we want the date on there to be accurate of when the contract starts we are paying a pretty penny for it so we want to make sure that the rest of our app is done so as soon as we sign that contract and it begins that you all can start testing just so we're not spending your hard-earned money on this service that we're not using like it would be a kind of a ways to sign that contract start paying for it and it's just sitting there while the devs work on the other parts of the contract and we can't really use it if that makes sense so it is the wall it is the site basically the way you're going to access your app the way you sign in it's going to be a lot easier and I think this will be great for our target audience which is our war room viewers which are the people that don't know crypto that have never bought crypto this is their first time buying crypto I think this will be great I think the educational segment that we're adding to our website and app will also be major I think YouTube and rumble we the people has been doing an excellent job adding those videos on there we're trying to make it as simple as possible I don't think I really haven't gotten any bad feedback as far as that goes I think the those videos are super super simple where generally when I've given people that link I've not heard from them at all which is I think a good thing for the most part because that means they're getting it done so we'll have a lot more of that and it'll for you guys who know a lot more and you're a lot well versed in crypto they might be almost annoying to have such you know such short videos like everything's in snippets right we have adding PPI it's in a different video than purchasing PPI but I think this will be great because the average user is you know it doesn't have the most patience like when we are online so I think that'll work really well for us but this is for February the app is gonna be our number one priority we have our main dev who mainly built the majority of the contract who is brilliant he is ready to work on it he is just we're just waiting on our previous devs to go ahead and get that all done and then change now and Transact I know some of you are having issues if you are still having issues go ahead and send me your email we are working with them as far as that goes but change now is live Transact I know a few of your emails are not working seems like maybe your accounts have been disabled but go ahead and DM me with your Transact email and I'll get you taken care of we also so for Transact I know you guys are sharing your emails Transact just has a they have a certain system in place right to help them weed out the scammers basically kind of like any business does where it gives you like if you run an online business you probably get a report that tells you if this buyer is low risk medium risk or high risk and if Transact gets a high risk that's when they'll disable your account but that high risk somewhere sometimes can be something as simple as like a this user has you know above average age could be something literally that random so we'll have a contract for you guys actually I think that should be done Wednesday we'll have a contract for you guys to sign and turn in your driver's license for us to reinstate your Transact account and that's just basically saying that if you ever do buy through Transact and then say you try a charge back or anything like that then we have a contract for you to get that all taken care of and that's just we know that's not you guys that are here but that's just to prevent us and Transact from dealing with scammers because what ends up happening is that we'd be eating the cost so again that's not targeted at you guys specifically is just you know just like any other business they have to do that and if they reinstate an account then we have to take the responsibility for that so it's just to protect ourselves which essentially is your hard-earned tax money do the higher-ups really not understand that 8% tax 16% percent tax in and out you can all do math right is what keeps transfer count low transfers to who what are we talking about I think we might be near PPY all-time high JL Young says let's drop it zero how you doing how you doing Johnny will there be a tax-free day to transfer PPY from non-app PPY wallet to the PPY no that's not a bad idea we love we the people yes we do thank you we the people for doing an excellent job on our social media it's been amazing we also added a graphic designer to an assistant to we the people and then thank you dog bone the websites amazing he's got some new pages there which have been really really cool I feel like everybody does all the work and I just just kind of sit here and chat with you guys I just do the fun stuff how much how much do we have to pay to not update their prices for two weeks so we can get those homeboy okay and I was reading your I was reading your question so seriously trying to understand it PPY is going to be strong on polygon yeah I think our team did a lot of research to finally decide definitely definitely the future very easy to trend on polygon no competition hey we'll take that you said once transfer accounts increase the higher ups that they would oh sorry I okay I was meaning transactions period like once our volume increases we're just trying you know we got to get everybody paid and when we find excellent people we want to like any other business we want to make sure that we keep those people so we want to make sure that we compensate everybody even though we are a startup we want to compensate everybody so that they are happy so that they do stick around and said that we do have the best team that we can so as you all know neither Boris or Steve have ever been paid anything they will actually both bought coins the only coins they've been given was the their wallets of 1 billion coins but outside of that they've not been paid a penny so there's you know they're in no way trying to get rich off us or anything like that but we do have to pay everybody and we just want to make sure that we are self-sustaining before we start decreasing and lowering that tax and I think that'll be no problem with the volume I don't think there'll be an issue there at all I think our biggest hurdle right now is really getting that app a hundred percent as soon as that it's good then we can start the marketing there's just no reason for us to do marketing on war room because there's no way somebody like my mom or grandma it's gonna be able to figure out quick swap on trust wallet I don't think that's gonna happen my mom's pretty young my mom's like 52 but it's on Facebook all day hi who is that somebody just said hey oh hi no worries I'll meet you now you guys could come on here and chat relieve some of the pressure off me yeah yeah I know I was like wait this is a long one let's see what this is about it's it's normal that I can't see the transaction on trust wallet um probably just needs to update let's see it looks like you're are you international yeah you have to be real patriots work for free is what I heard okay how are they supposed to feed their families Perry people have bills and have you been to the grocery store have you been to the farmers market do you know how much a steer costs now do you know how much raw milk and raw butter costs now what I'm very disappointed I went to look at a house cuz I really want my own little baby cow and there's already four offers on it mayhem says yes that's what I'm talking about transactions are transfers lower the tax rate to increase transaction counts people don't buy due to the tax rate when Rish was that your mom no that was not my mom or my grandma my grandma's cute but she spends all day on Facebook too when people say like oh younger people spend the time on their phones I'm like I don't know cuz my parents are my mom's there my grandma's always in there talking to all her friends and all her kids and all her grandkids on Facebook and she gets upset this kid or this grandkid posted this on on Facebook who is that wind chime which I don't I don't think we've seen wind chime for a while oh it's French I took two years of French but it's kind of like the two years of Spanish I took I traded math math was my highest grade I was the highest grade in the class I beat all the boys and I traded my math homework for the Spanish and the French homework so there's my secret it's never had a thing for learning other languages Chumapel Sarah and Miyamo Sarah is like what I heard what I learned I live in Canada I have lots of family in Canada I actually have a sister in Canada I don't know why she'd move from Phoenix to Canada but thank you Russ have a good night the first three offers on that house for a Black Rock Vanguard on Stacey probably Transac has 2.2 million left we need to test our refill timing on PPYmatic yeah I actually very much regret not I regret trading math for Spanish because I've lived in Phoenix like what come on should have paid attention to Spanish probably probably helped a lot my job Bobby says his brother moved to Canada to you what why yeah I don't I don't understand that I do want to move somewhere like I don't know cooler than here maybe but sometimes I just go to Pinetop to my parents house up there and I'm like okay I'm good but I do feel a lot better when I'm there just in the middle of the woods like I think just what it does to your body that's a good valentine I don't know Perry that almost makes up for you saying Grant I just said that name which is I forget what you even said who's better for nice do you know where he moved oh my sister lives in a really small town in the middle of nowhere it's like Mississauga or something am I saying that right so Wednesday can I fill out a form to finally be approved by Transac so I can buy an app yes go ahead and DM me your email we'll find out why you got disabled move there for a girl oh my gosh that's my sister move there for her husband yeah who she met online which she met him like a really long time ago that's before like meeting people online was normal you know like now you marry somebody online and it's like oh it's normal which is actually really weird because okay this is really this is this is really weird but like I'm a very in person I'm there unless I'm working like in sales when I bartended or when I only had a car dealership or when I had a restaurant like I feel like work is completely different because you have to talk to people and be community service like customer service but what's really weird is there's I think I have like this curse when I used to like be on online dating services as I see people on there but then I date them for which I don't I never like date a lot cuz you know super conservative race like that so I every almost every boyfriend I had I actually married so just a few but anyway what there's like this really weird things that I noticed months or years later that this is somebody I actually saw on an app but like hit no on several times but then I end up meeting them in real life and then being married or engaged to them so I don't know if that happens with anybody else completely same with my brother online got married and moved to Ottawa hey my sister used to live there but she moved she moved from Ottawa to it's like called Messiragua or some I don't know what it's called and now do what yeah and actually she's just got divorced to a few years ago but she's still there with a kid hey Bobby send me your brother's contact does he want a crazy girl I don't know why I do want to move to cooler weather just not that cold that's awesome who added this somebody added something I didn't want to add my own country songs you know so I kept it to you guys his list Bobby says he's liberal yep my sister there is too I think that's why they're in Canada there you go perfect match highly do not highly do not recommend yeah actually Idaho well it was on my places to live and then I don't know it just fell off not for a reason I just that's not one of the places like I was specifically looking specifically at still looking at Arkansas Florida kind of fell off for the same reasons I don't know why Arkansas like it's kind of at the top of the list I'm not sure there's not really like a reason specifically but I just toward to gravitate to look in there it's like Oklahoma Arkansas to too many crazies enough Oklahoma and too many crazies in Arkansas too but for some reason I don't know I believe there's somebody there that would be like normal look at Destin Florida Destin Florida what is your official role title on the team these days that's a good question janitor still janitor Wow just now checking out telegram 57 messages to catch up on G mayhem says I mean you're signing vendor contracts I am yeah my name is the owner on the LLC's so I am the one signing everything holy smokes you guys are coming in hot with

update on the McNifty's my father was a trucker and he already made a lot of delivery in the USA and a lot of states he was proud of the USA and he just put USA flag right on our ground close to our family house now has passed away oh but I know how proud he should be about all that patriots like us fought for liberty and right thank you for sharing that's really awesome that's super sweet you're a managing member on PPI as far as they'll see easier mayhem says how did I miss that you've been gone for a really long time I feel like it's the app going to be simplified polygon only oh gosh no not polygon only we definitely don't think we'd want to corner ourselves in to polygon only so no just instead of FGB now we are adding of course Patriot Pay we are very excited to continue adding new coins which I think will help everybody but eventually we'd like to be an app that's everything you need as far as crypto goes and more Bannon homeless wanted to give us a shout out today give him a shot and he might have yes he was very so when I saw him a few times when he was here for TPUSA he was really super and that's that's when price was like quite a bit lower than it is now I want to say it was in the high twos maybe low threes but it had just shot up a little bit I forget now oh I know what it is it was right after it goes right after snapshot correct if I'm thinking correctly and he was he was excited so he said there was on fire why are the charts on fire what's going on he's super super excited for that this one the jig is up Sarah we know your cue what you tried to divert us from your trail with Stacy cute winning being added to the team but we know that's just a classic misdirection to it well Fizz what what are you drinking or smoking and where do we get some Stacy's claiming she's cute I think that's funny actually Fizz says discord brings the troll out hey I like that you know I I appreciate honesty be free says just joining boys what did I miss you know it's
