(0:00 - 0:16)
We actually have some really good consolidation going on over here in the low 0.002s, which we wanna see. You wanna see that. You wanna see a quick break of support and then right back to following support, adding strength, holding up strength, and doing well in terms of the price action.

(0:16 - 0:30)
So what did we do today? What was going on behind the scenes? First and foremost, that material news is still pending. Still extremely excited about that. I know you guys are getting frustrated and you guys are getting worried about the news.

(0:31 - 0:38)
You guys are getting impatient. Completely understand every single part of that that happens. And I know that, like, you guys don't know me.

(0:38 - 0:57)
You guys don't, you know what I mean? Like, you guys, most of you guys, or all of you guys know my name. You can look me up or whatever, but you guys probably don't trust me because you don't know me. So it's like, okay, why am I gonna believe this jackass that keeps talking about this news? Well, the good thing is there's a lot of people in here that do know me.

(0:57 - 1:09)
So if they do know me and they trust me and they believe in this, then there's some people that do. So I'm happy about that. I hope that you guys believe it too.

(1:10 - 1:35)
I hope that you guys are excited too because I wouldn't come up here every night and talk in the day and talk in the afternoon if I was bullshitting you. I wouldn't be saying that if I was saying, oh, we have this huge news coming and then the news never comes because I'll be completely transparent with you about every step of the way of what I can tell you. I can tell you that we're waiting on, we've already set the negotiation that's been done.

(1:35 - 1:47)
We figured out all of the backend stuff. The Gateway Pundit didn't happen and that was bullshit, but the big league politics happened. Gateway Pundit should be coming tomorrow and Breitbart is doing an interview with me.

(1:47 - 1:52)
That should be tomorrow too. So those are the publications. I got off of that for just a second.

(1:55 - 2:03)
Yeah, but thank you. Thank you to Turok for saying I trust it. Yeah, so the ads on Poohcoin, I have a screenshot.

(2:03 - 2:14)
I don't know if it was sent anywhere, but where is it at? Let me pull up the picture. I think it was in my text to be honest. Wait just a second, just a second.

(2:15 - 2:19)
Yep, yep, yep, right here. This was at 5.32 PM. This was a screenshot.

(2:19 - 2:30)
I'll throw it in the Discord, but yeah, what have we got listening over here? That's still pending. I got a text about that. We've paid for it.

(2:30 - 2:34)
It's all paid for. It's all ready to go. And the CoinZilla ads haven't even, yeah, exactly.

(2:35 - 2:38)
So it's saying pending. This is what it looks like. It still says pending.

(2:38 - 2:43)
That's okay. That's the CoinZilla. CoinZilla is great because we have 10 different things that are coming out with it.

(2:44 - 2:49)
It's 10 different sites that advertise for it. They drop for it, which is really awesome. It's really exciting.

(2:49 - 2:54)
So can't wait for that. Breitbart, like I said, interviewed me. That should be tomorrow.

(2:54 - 3:03)
I'll give you updates of when that happens, what they say, whatever they ask. There'll probably be a similar thing to Breitbart as to what Postmillennial did. They'll call me, ask some questions about the thing.

(3:03 - 3:10)
Maybe they'll do a podcast. I don't know. I'm waiting on the podcast off of the Postmillennial that I did the other day, today.

(3:10 - 3:19)
But we did have the big league politics, which was great. Gateway Punisher will also be coming. Those three people have been in contact with us.

(3:20 - 3:28)
34 makes a tremendous, tremendous, tremendous, tremendous opportunity. Not opportunity. He makes a tremendous point about the stuff doesn't come out overnight.

(3:28 - 3:36)
This stuff has been going on for weeks. And this is day 32. Still, it's just over a month that we've been doing this thing.

(3:36 - 3:47)
And to have news like this pending is fucking awesome. And no, there's nothing that the community individuals can do to help get the news finalized. It's just between us and another party.

(3:47 - 3:53)
We want it. We want to get this thing done in a timely manner. We want this thing to be figured out.

(3:53 - 4:03)
In the meantime, yeah, exactly. Shill, I know it's tired of shilling. But we're so young and organic right now that we need to keep shilling.

(4:04 - 4:10)
We need to keep telling one person about this thing. We need to keep telling one more person about this. You tell one more new person that you haven't seen.

(4:12 - 4:18)
So the donation for Wisconsin. I reached out. So I looked at some of the things that people sent.

(4:19 - 4:34)
And I get skeptical when things pop up about donations that just happened. Because I've seen a bunch of stuff about shootings and things like that, where people are really sick in the head. And they create these donation pages.

(4:34 - 4:42)
And then nothing comes up from it. So all the money's gone. Like I don't know if you guys got fucking hiccups tonight.

(4:42 - 4:54)
Jesus Christ. But I don't know if you guys saw the 2020 this past weekend. But there was a family of like 13 children that were basically like locked inside all night long.

(4:55 - 5:00)
Not all night long, all their whole lives, 29 years. One of them, there was like a two year old. They're chained to the bed.

(5:01 - 5:11)
It was fucking horrible. And they donated like, I think $270,000 to the family. And nobody saw the money everywhere.

(5:11 - 5:23)
So that always gets me skeptical about these donations. That always gets me skeptical about doing that stuff. So I like to do some due diligence, figure out what's going on, figuring it out.

(5:23 - 5:33)
Hey, and this guy's fancy son said, big news that won't happen. Fancy son, I can't wait for this to happen. And I would be very, very happy to show you that you're gonna be wrong.

(5:35 - 5:37)
But that's good. We want doubters. We want people that are not gonna believe it.

(5:37 - 5:45)
We want people that are gonna be on the other side. A chance we can donate in person. It will eliminate a lot of the FUD.

(5:46 - 5:55)
Hey, I would love to donate in person. I'm not near Wisconsin, but if we can get something going on in that sense, if we get something up, I would fucking love that. I would absolutely love that.

(5:58 - 6:07)
Yeah, I 100% still wanna do the donation. Like I said, I just get skeptical. So I was gonna wait kind of for something prevalent to come out, whether it's on the news.

(6:07 - 6:21)
Because once something hits the news and it's like, hey, you can donate here. Cause I haven't seen anything on like Fox News and CNN or any like the major news publications saying like, hey, this is how you donate to these families or say you donate to something. So I haven't seen anything of that sort.

(6:21 - 6:26)
So I've just been waiting. It's day one since the tragedy happened. Fucking horrible.

(6:26 - 6:34)
And the sick thing is that people make money on this stuff. And that's the worst thing. That's the worst thing.

(6:34 - 6:41)
Cause they might do some donations, but they might even take like 5% of it. And it's just very, very horrible to see. It's very horrible to see.

(6:42 - 6:51)
But what else is going on? So we had the Gateway Pundit that should be coming. Oh, Probit, I'm gonna send you a screenshot of the last thing that I've seen. I'll show you.

(6:52 - 6:58)
I'll even send a little screenshot. Like I said, they're on different time zones. So we had to do some things with their wallets today.

(6:58 - 7:09)
Why is my snipping tool not working right now? Said, blah, blah, blah. He said, we will test again. And I said, any time update? It's still nothing.

(7:09 - 7:20)
So yeah, exactly, Barry Trask. GoFundMe can be very shady and I don't want to donate our money to them and then it goes into the wrong hands. Thank you, Bag Holder for life.

(7:22 - 7:30)
But the in-person donations, if we can find out something like that, hey, that would be awesome. I would love to do something like that. But the messages that I just sent, that's Probit.

(7:31 - 7:37)
Esmond Hui is a fucking, yeah, we're gonna sign him up for the Daily Cat Facts. Fuck that guy. He's acting like a stu-nod.

(7:37 - 7:42)
We gotta smack him around the head. But he's an idiot. He's a real idiot.

(7:43 - 7:48)
Corporate Media, we don't care about the coverage though. We're not doing that donation for the coverage. That's just horrible.

(7:48 - 7:57)
I saw there was, I read a story about a grandmother of three grandchildren that died and it just, it hurt me. It didn't feel good. I saw that.

(7:57 - 8:05)
He was released on $1,000 bail or something like that and it was just unbelievable. It doesn't make any sense. But that's going on there.

(8:05 - 8:13)
Like I said, Gateway Pundit and the Breitbart things are coming out. They should be tomorrow. The Pooh Coin ads, we mentioned that already.

(8:14 - 8:21)
We're waiting on the news to drop for them. We're waiting on those ads and those banners to come. That comes with the Coinsilla package which still hasn't been rolled out.

(8:21 - 8:33)
We were told today, but as we've been hearing, everything that we've been told from other parties have been pushed. ESC, basically all Binance things were down. We sent the screenshot to before.

(8:33 - 8:41)
I think somebody probably has that saved if they want to send that in here as well. Just to prove what I'm saying, that they're behind. They're down.

(8:41 - 8:44)
It's not us. We did everything on our end. We paid.

(8:44 - 8:54)
We paid a lot of things and we're waiting on a lot of different things. What can you be excited about? Tomorrow is Wednesday. We have day before Thanksgiving.

(8:54 - 8:59)
Ryan and I are gonna do an AMA. We're gonna figure out a time. Probably like early evening.

(9:00 - 9:15)
We'll do an AMA on Twitter, like a 30 or 45 minute session about getting people involved. And I know some people with some pretty big Twitter followings that do some trading on Twitter. There might be some people in here that have big Twitter followings.

(9:16 - 9:24)
Please, please, please get the word out. I would love to see a big AMA with Ryan and I. I've actually never done one on Twitter but that'd be very exciting. I think that would be tremendous.

(9:24 - 9:29)
I think that would be awesome. Awesome, awesome, awesome. So I'm excited to do that.

(9:29 - 9:42)
I'm very excited to get Ryan on board because one, Ryan's the fucking man, as you guys know. And two, Ryan is a great speaker and it's just gonna be awesome to go up there and do that. But other than that, we're doing a lot of different things.

(9:42 - 9:49)
A lot of different things behind the scenes trying to get this thing all squared away, all squared away and going. Oh, people mentioned the Don Jr. cameo. He had nothing.

(9:49 - 9:53)
So I clicked, there's like a extension. I extended it. We're kind of just in limbo.

(9:53 - 10:06)
I don't think we're gonna get one, which is annoying because it's on fucking Trump Jr. I wish that we could get something. So just waiting on that, waiting on that, waiting on that. But yeah, the Turning Point USA picture cracks me up.

(10:07 - 10:17)
The Loza cameo, I actually, I sent, you can do like a pre-request, like a chat. I send a chat because the things are so long. It's like a week long before you even get a response.

(10:17 - 10:34)
We can get a response for a DM within the past 24 hours. So I sent a DM to Loza and I haven't gotten a message back about that, which is frustrating, but it is what it is. Cameos are hit or miss though, because for the most part, they don't run cameos.

(10:34 - 10:41)
They don't do that. So it's somebody else there that's in their management team or their media team that runs it for them. That's the tricky part.

(10:42 - 10:50)
Oh, what else? So the Gateway Pundit, like I said, so those articles are coming back. What can you get excited about tomorrow? It's what I'm gonna focus on now. Those two articles should be dropping.

(10:50 - 10:55)
The Coinsilla should be dropping. Probit, they haven't given us a date. I think it's gonna be like a weird time.

(10:55 - 11:09)
They're just gonna drop us, which is just annoying and frustrating. WhiteBit, we're still waiting on them. Like I said, the BSC, the Binance are kind of in a tough spot right now, which is frustrating, but it is what it is in that sense.

(11:10 - 11:23)
Probably worth it just to do the 1300. Hey, I would love to do the Loza, but I just wanted to see if we were gonna get caught in limbo again with Donald Trump Jr., because that's kind of what we got beat around the bush. Because a lot of these people, they don't, it's commercial, but it's advertising.

(11:23 - 11:41)
Usually when they say commercial use, they mean like, oh, you work for a corporation and you're doing like an outing or something like that. And then you have somebody that speak it, let's say like the Donald Trump Jr. one, for example, is $5,000. So let's say you get Donald Trump Jr. and he does your corporate thing.

(11:41 - 11:50)
That's like if you work at like Apple or something like that, and you're doing like a company retreat, and he'll say like, hey, everybody, thanks for working hard. It's not gonna be like advertising a coin or doing something like that. So that's the tricky part.

(11:51 - 12:14)
That's why I wanted to message Loza first and say, hey, would you be interested in doing something like this? But the good thing is the party and the Turning Point USA thing that we're sponsoring in December, Bryson Gray, yeah, Bryson Gray, is gonna be performing there and I'm gonna be meeting him. So maybe we can get something going on there. Maybe we can get something in the works in that sense, which is really awesome, really tremendous.

(12:15 - 12:21)
The Twitter talk, yes, the Twitter talk is still on tomorrow. That's gonna be sick. That's something to get very excited about.

(12:23 - 12:41)
Do, do, do, do, somebody's able to... We just had a message from somebody saying they're gonna give away 1 million FJB if somebody is able to get Elon to tweet about or reply to a tweet about FJB. Hey, man, if we can get that, that would be tremendous. And I know we've been tweeting at him a bunch.

(12:41 - 12:53)
I've seen a whole lot of tweets from there. Elon, any of those guys, Donald Trump Jr. Oh, we need to get somebody, somebody going on Twitter, Joe Rogan. Rogan would love this.

(12:53 - 12:58)
We just gotta get the word out to him. I wish Tim Pool would drop something to him. Articles should be coming tomorrow, yes.

(12:59 - 13:16)
Let me just call Elon real quick, yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly, if somebody can get Elon to do it, I'll fucking donate, because that's unreal. What about Hodge twins? Must be reading, what about the coinzilla? Sorry, I was just reading the text.

(13:17 - 13:23)
China, I don't know what you're talking about with China. But hey, we have a lot of exciting things. And I keep talking about all these intermediary things.

(13:25 - 13:43)
Honestly, with the news that we're working on coming, you guys are gonna be so fucking blown away that you guys, there will need to be no further news after that, which it's that exciting, it's that important. But yeah, Steven Crowder would be great. I love his videos.

(13:43 - 13:52)
We just have so many things. We have so many things going on in the works. And this one thing has been taking up a bunch of my time and a bunch of my energy and taking away from a lot of my sleep.

(13:53 - 13:57)
But we're working on it. We're really working on it. The team is not stopping.

(13:57 - 14:02)
The team is working fucking hard. Blueface Investor. I would love for the news to be this week.

(14:02 - 14:05)
I would love for it to be tomorrow. We don't have a timetable on it. It's by the day.

(14:06 - 14:19)
It's even by the minute, by the phone call. So it's a different type of news, I wish I can specify what type of news it is, but it's a different type of news where it's not just like, oh, we're doing this advertisement. Oh, I wanna be on Fox News.

(14:19 - 14:22)
It's nothing like that. It's one, a lot bigger. And two, it's harder.

(14:24 - 14:29)
It's also Thanksgiving week. So that kind of changes some stuff up. Like there's somebody in Florida.

(14:29 - 14:32)
There's somebody in Nashville. Like there's just people around. There's people around.

(14:32 - 14:36)
So we just need to figure out the best. It could drop any time. It really could be.

(14:36 - 14:41)
It depends on when everything is going to be okay. Let's get a commercial. I saw that.

(14:42 - 14:45)
A Breitbart is dropping. They're gonna be doing an interview. That's exciting.

(14:45 - 14:51)
The Coinsilla, exciting. Gateway Pundit, exciting. ProBit and WhiteBit still on the works, exciting.

(14:52 - 15:01)
But, hey, doing a lot. The billboards, they turned us down because of, oh, I don't know about the other billboards. I remember somebody, Animosity, I haven't seen him in here in a while.

(15:01 - 15:10)
Maybe he's out. But Animosity was saying something about the billboards and I just haven't seen anything from there. But I hope he's still in here.

(15:10 - 15:24)
I talked to Animosity a few times on voice, but he was the one that was talking about it. The truck billboard in Times Square, they also gave us some backlash because of the political-esque of this coin. Dextool, eh, Super Bowl commercial.

(15:24 - 15:27)
Imagine a Super Bowl commercial. Hey, maybe, maybe. We don't know until February.

(15:28 - 15:32)
We don't know until February. More veteran donations. More veteran donations are coming.

(15:32 - 15:38)
They are coming. Donate 20. Yeah, whoever just tweeted that.

(15:38 - 15:47)
CryptoButlers, yeah, I'll donate 25 grand to if we can get Elon Musk to say something about it. Somebody said, tits university. That'd be fucking funny.

(15:48 - 15:56)
But fuck the Cowboys Thanksgiving game. I am Natalie Portman. I love this guy.

(15:56 - 16:06)
This guy sends all these messages and he's unbelievable. He sent me the first picture of just the straight-up grill and says, I'm here. I fucking love it.

(16:06 - 16:14)
I love it, I love it, I love it. For a Super Bowl commercial, they would actually, the NFL would shut down if we had a Super Bowl commercial for it. Let's go Brandon Coyne.

(16:15 - 16:22)
But again, nothing really else going on. I'm sorry for being so late tonight. Again, I got caught in something.

(16:23 - 16:31)
We'll be more timely tomorrow and especially with that AMA with Ryan. I am fucking excited. I am very, very, very excited.

(16:31 - 16:37)
I cannot wait for that talk with Ryan. We're gonna get a lot of eyes on that. Some of those Twitter things blow up.

(16:37 - 16:47)
I've seen things with like 14,000 listeners and honestly, I can see that happening. And we have like almost 7,000 holders. So if we can get that in that sense, that would be tremendous.

(16:47 - 16:54)
That would be absolutely tremendous. But hey, we're doing a lot of work. We're doing a lot of different things.

(16:55 - 17:00)
Is what time is early evening for AMA? Yeah, I said early evening, probably. Probably like six or seven. I'll coordinate with Ryan.

(17:01 - 17:11)
Trying to make it appealing to everybody where everybody can listen. Like this time of 9.57 PM would be too late for people. I know some people are already asleep or that could just make a weird time for people.

(17:11 - 17:21)
So we'll figure something out. But fucking yawning. Fucking need to catch up on some sleep sooner or later, but that's not happening until we get this deal done.

(17:23 - 17:28)
Airplane ads over the college games. Yeah, we've been working on that, trying to get those things done. The China ads.

(17:28 - 17:35)
We did some Chinese advertising. We did some marketing and trying to get into some groups. They have a big freedom movement going on.

(17:35 - 17:41)
So we're trying to target those. We can probably do some more things on that, to be honest. Advertisement on Pornhub.

(17:41 - 17:53)
That'd be fucking crazy. Just reading some of the other messages. All right, but for the most part, that's all we got going on, man.

(17:53 - 18:00)
Just keep shilling. Keep working hard. I've been not as active in the Discord, like I've been saying, because I've been working on this thing.

(18:01 - 18:11)
It's not just... So CoinZilla and PoohCoin will be targeting APAC and US. So that sounds great to me, honestly. That sounds really great to me.

(18:11 - 18:16)
So we'll be good. Again, we'll be really good. I trust this group.

(18:16 - 18:31)
I trust myself more than anything. And I trust what we've done, because we've done a shit ton in the past 32 days. And we're gonna do a whole shit ton more in the next 32 days.

(18:31 - 18:39)
So keep this thing moving. Keep this thing fucking going up. Keep this thing excited, because we are not stopping.

(18:39 - 18:48)
I will not stop. Like I said before, either get on the train or get off the tracks, because we're not stopping for fucking anybody. Thank you guys all for listening tonight.

(18:48 - 18:56)
Thank you guys all for staying strong and holding. Thank you guys all for being in here and being a part of this community. Let's keep this fucking thing going.

(18:56 - 19:00)
Keep shilling. Keep working hard. We fucking got this thing.

(19:00 - 19:03)
All right, everybody. I'll text you guys in a little bit.
