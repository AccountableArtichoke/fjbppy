Happy Friday, hope everybody's doing well. Hope you've all had a great week. Let's see, PatriotPay.

Our onRamper bug has been completed by the devs. It's in the development app. We're just testing it to make sure because it doesn't always happen.

So we'll probably finish testing it tonight. After that, deploy it to you all and hopefully the issue is solved and you guys don't run into that issue. So that's awesome.

It took a little bit of our devs and onRamper's devs to get that squared away. Again, hopefully we'll see how it is on you guys' end because we were having issues trying to reproduce the bug earlier this week. Yeah, I think it was earlier this week.

So I will let you know as soon as we make that live to you all for you all to test it. It's nice because it doesn't really require, well, I shouldn't say that. I was going to say it doesn't require you all by but it is because it's the last step, at least for me.

When I've tried testing it, it's all the way the very end after you put your payment info and all that. Yes, that is the auto-populate bug. Huge because I was hoping that didn't take a while like the other bug we've experienced before with the third parties.

Gift cards are also complete but we are testing them. We are running into a change now issue. It's just the same thing you guys have seen.

I'm sure the issues with Trust Wallet the last few weeks, Matic, Polygon going through all the updates. So change now also, you know, we've run into this throughout the years where they are having some system issues and they're upgrading but we're actually going to take advantage of that while we wait for them to work these issues. We will be integrating a DEX into the app.

Sorry, getting distracted here. So that's very exciting and coming much sooner than we had originally planned. The nice part about this is not only being able to get you the absolute lowest rates but also just making sure our app really is, I don't want to say like bug proof, but you know just having different layers where if change now isn't working that's not going to, you know, stop our entire app from working and all swaps on our app from working.

And then if quick swap is having issues then, you know, change now and we'll continue adding, you know, we've spoken about this before, we'll be adding other swapping platforms or APIs like to our app just so there's alternatives. So again if one of these are down, if change now is having issues or simple swaps having issues or quick swaps having issues then it doesn't stop you all from swapping or doing what we need to. Similar to the on-ramping, we'll continue to add more on-ramping options on the app to give you all just as many options as possible in case you get blocked or something like that.

Similar to what happened to transact before where, you know, your account was disabled you were just SOL. So that is kind of working in our favor again. We already had that in the plans but we'll just, so we're going to do that now much sooner than later.

That should be completed by this coming week. Along with, seems like after I shared last week what a new user had done, got a few DMs of a few of you who've done the same where you have sent funds to your smart wallet address but you've taken that polygon address instead of your Matic address assuming that they both match because they usually do and then have lost your funds even though they show up on blockchain. Our devs will add that capability this week.

What it is exactly is having the native coins be in smart wallet too. So now instead of just having Matic right now you only have one Matic wallet and that's your expert wallet. If you're in smart wallet mode you'll still see the Matic there but it is, you know, if you try to send Matic to your P3P wallet it is an expert mode wallet.

Now you are going to have both expert and smart wallet mode in Matic or with Matic. So for any of you that have sent Matic to a wrong address and it's just, you know, sat there in your wallet, you can see it on the blockchain, you will be able to access that once that's complete and again the plan is to have that completed by this coming week. So that'll be nice too and also help with user error.

I know some people have done that with Coinbase too where, you know, you've assumed and then sent the coins and I hear they also have some sort of fix now too. So that'll be nice. The other dev has moved on to the Patriot Perks so he's working on badges and adding badges and bug reporting in the app.

That'll be really cool. There's just different levels and you'll achieve those as you, you know, achieve the different. They'll have all their criteria for each level listed.

So that'll be pretty cool. I'm still waiting on the education videos again. I know I shared with you guys that we are kind of taking a detour because just with all the feedback that we've gotten from I want to say like the average conservative is just there's a lot of wrong information out there about exactly what crypto is.

So we're going even a step back. Coffee, coffee is actually coming sooner than we expected. I know they had the death in the family and they pushed it back and now it's back to a week out actually.

So I should be able to pick it up this weekend. I'll keep you guys updated on that and the dog bags supposed to this coming week. Yeah, I got excited because I did get a shipment today of some other merch but that was not the dog bags.

I think that's all the updates I have.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
I never thought a 10 year old would be so destructive. A little bit of a gut there, Ed. I had no idea.

Integrating what into the app. Yes. Now that auto populate is fixed, do we push ahead with marketing for this month?

Yes, as soon as we have you all test it. As soon as we're done testing it plan for that to be this weekend if testing goes well. Yes, as long as it hasn't caused any other bugs, I should say.

Is anyone on the PPY team in communication with Donald Trump Jr.? I imagine Boris is probably very close to him. I personally am not.

I do not have any contact with Donald Trump Jr. or President Donald Trump for that matter. Any update on when we will get the tax-free refunds for the testing? I would think now all the prices.

Actually, I need to send a thank you for that reminder. I'm sorry you guys are sometimes pushed to the back and everything else takes priority. I swear that was on my list.

Any comments or feedback from Boris? I'm trying to get Boris on hopefully soon-ish.

[Speaker 2]
And I think that answers the next question.

[Speaker 1]
Is Boris excited still or had any updates on the app or marketing? Yes, he knows the app is pretty much ready as of this last week, beginning this week, late last week. Soon-ish August.

I will add that's up to Boris. Boris calls those shots. I am not the one with that busy of a schedule.

If it were up to me, yes August, but I definitely have not gotten that commitment and can't promise that. Any updates on we will see people's products and classifieds? I don't think I have any pending.

I know last time I checked, I don't have any pending posts, meaning you all haven't posted any. I don't see any classified listings. I feel like I have to go through everything and I love clearing stuff out, but I don't know that you guys would be into any of my stuff.

I'm a little strange in that way. Who wants my dogs? Parrots?

Succulents? My niece went around and counted all my succulents after I just bought some. I think she said she counted like 140 something.

I don't imagine you'd all want to buy any of those. Any updates on we will see people's classifieds? Does the price bother you or do you feel we have an onslaught of buying coming?

No, I honestly don't ever check the price. The only time I can honestly say the only time I've checked the price is when I'm trying to calculate something like a few days ago. I was trying to calculate ChangeNow versus Dex because somebody who was it seemed like I don't know if that was a new user or somebody dm'd me about the price difference.

So we're trying to get that down with ChangeNow because it shouldn't be that much of a difference and ChangeNow had it miscalculated. So we're in the middle of figuring that out that way to get you all the best price and we don't get that. That's not like us receiving double the tax or anything like that.

So now I can honestly say that does not bother me. If it did I think we'd be doing a lot more to try to hype up the price, but I think we're definitely kind of like the type of holders we have. We're definitely changing.

Yeah, and it won't it won't take much in my opinion to move the price because we are so small. You guys have seen that plenty of times. Steve Bannon up to date on everything somehow does he have instructions to his show to push it when ready?

No, he's not up to date since you know since being away. The last contact I've had with Steve's team was actually was conservative and he saw he's good friends with Maureen and when he saw her at the RNC so he called. Who did I talk to him last?

Was it yesterday or day before? And he was like I talked to Maureen about it. She was telling me how great of a project.

She mentioned you by name and she said it was really good. I should stick with it. I wanted to be like told you so.

So he's excited about that, but I think that's the last uh thing I haven't talked to Maureen. Where's of a Trump-backed crypto project for conservatives Republicans? If that is released soon will that impact our footprint?

Um I think we kind of touched on that in the last voice chat. I don't think it'll be soon either. I think they I think Donald Trump Jr. said that and if there's anybody that knows we know. Now I understand Donald Trump Jr. probably has a different budget than we have so I imagine that would go a little bit quicker, but as you all know there's a lot of it that is really simply not budget related. Now how would that impact us? Again I honestly think that would be helpful.

If anything it's we've talked about this before when you are the first in the market you have the pros and cons and the cons is that people don't know what most conservatives Republicans don't know or have the wrong idea of what decentralized finance is to begin with. You go on social media and read some comments. I think a lot of conservatives Republicans don't realize that it's decentralized like this is what we want.

I think they think digital and think like oh then the government can really shut it on and off which is ironic considering that's what they could do with your phone and bank accounts. So I think that would help us in that aspect but I think competition's Now keep in mind I think we have a lot of underrated features in our app that yeah unless you have somebody out that's going to copy everything we do but yeah I think there's there's so many features in our app that are actually really really cool all the way from okay like the smart wallet which a few are starting even like the bigger wallets are starting to kind of push something similar but you know a lot a lot of the other features like the marketplace the education which I realize you all haven't seen much of the wallet to wallet messaging and you know so on so I just need it to work and for our funds not to be scammed out and I think that would be great it was confirmed that's an exchange not a coin token yeah I think they confirmed that it's not a coin or token I'm not sure if they confirmed it's an exchange but it's some sort of platform so who knows what that could be would be nice if they built out an actual bank and on ramper that's something that we've discussed and would be really nice but requires a ton more resources ie cash can you tell us more about the dex integration yes so uh what our dev this week this coming week will be working on is right now a lot of your transactions will get stuck if like I'm I'm trying to test gift cards because we've added some new gift card functions and I've been waiting now for over 24 hours for change now to swap I'm trying to swap from usdt to ppy I've already contacted change now and they are just you know having an internal issue unfortunately there's not much we could do about that and have these transactions stuck this has happened with some of you all's transactions now that's fine with our volume right now but imagine if we uh you know I don't know say two three four five ten times the volume we have now that's probably going to be an issue um and it's not very user friendly that's super annoying and definitely going to turn your grandma off so having a dex will give you a few options and the similar to you know right now you have on ramper if unicrypt blocks you it takes you to the next on ramper so similar to that where if change now we haven't got the priority of that yet on how that works so as soon as I know that info from the dev I'll share but basically if the change now swap doesn't work then it'll be a dex swap through quick swap so that'll be super nice to have a another option again we've always had not always but for a very long time had it on the road map to add another swapping service and then eventually a dex but I think this is happening much sooner than later because of the issues we're experiencing with change now as as they grow which is understandable and you guys have seen quick swaps been down before so this basically just gives us different outlets so that when one thing is down or one thing is updating it doesn't mean our whole entire app is down just gives our users different options you mentioned there may be a legal update at some point anything to share I don't have anything yet how far from a full launch and full marketing campaign are we if I had a crystal ball mp that is the million dollar question but I would be lying if I told you that there's just so many factors and so many parties and so many but if our app is working smoothly once this wallet bug with the wallet address bug and on ramper then we will definitely be marketing in august more than just influencers excited to see uh how that goes we just want to make sure again uh steve's biggest thing is uh we just don't want what happened on war room and I get it like kind of like well get over that um but

[Speaker 2]
yeah boris is close to me uh he said something to do with banking thinking on banking banking

[Speaker 1]
is all over our marketing videos is that a coincidence I honestly truly have no idea what their project's about I will see if boris has any clue but I honestly doubt he does but he I'm sure can ask would be would be nice to partner up but yes I can honestly say what I've said in the chat before I have no clue any more info about the direct on-ramp integration yes yes we are uh very close definition of very close I am not a chronological I don't know chrono is that a word chronicologist um I've just seen that strange flex oh there was a reason I checked my balance let's see there's a reason I did that what's with the grocery store though does anybody else do that go get uh lunch on friday it's like the most relaxing thing just people watch oh shoot I haven't tipped in that long why is this happening in discord are you serious

[Speaker 2]
why is this it's not been this long oh finally thank goodness that would be great a partnership would be amazing if we're all in this

[Speaker 1]
together it makes zero sense to be working in separate things don't want things to become disjointed so I'm hopeful that big players have a plan for all mega projects yeah it's there's there's so much um room especially in that space and anything that helps get the word out um I think it's great and at the end of the day we still we have Steve so what does direct on-ramp integration mean don't we have on-ramp or already in the app I guess I don't understand what we mean uh what you mean uh yes so currently you have to buy matic first and then swap uh so a direct on-ramp would be you purchasing patriot pay um this might not seem like a huge deal to us and you who you know are pretty defy savvy compared to the average conservative but it's a huge deal with our audience with our target audience that cuts how many steps like when you want to you know look at that um you I mean every step is going to stop a certain percentage of people right so the number of steps we can cut down is a huge deal did you mention recently Lydia was going to drop more yes uh doesn't the smart wallet do this already no so the smart wallet is more so you don't have to have gas um so uh with the direct on-ramper you don't need to buy matic first and then swap it to patriot pay because even in trust wallet right now right you go and first purchase matic and then you pull up quick swap and then swap it so yes usd to ppy straight from your debit card apple pay uh stripe you know that's everything I got I will keep you all updated let me know if you need anything else in the meantime uh yeah I'll let you know if I have any updates before the next voice chat otherwise I'll see you then uh as always please be careful sharing your info again uh nobody me admins devs will contact you and ask you for your personal info be careful of any links to uh don't connect your wallet to any strange links or anybody uh claiming to give you free things if you ever really want to do that make sure you just make another wallet that's what I would do is just make another wallet that way you're connecting another wallet that doesn't have all your uh millions of ppy in there um it's what I would do if I you know wanted to connect to other coins or chats or anything like that uh just be very very careful uh yeah always always ask in the chat if you have any questions there's usually one of us around uh so definitely better safe than sorry there uh just just be careful we haven't had anybody get scammed in a few weeks now so I feel like that's usually when it happens otherwise uh let me know if you guys have any questions you know how to contact me I will uh convert this right now and upload it hopefully it sounds better than the last one um and then write some notes actually let me feed the dogs first because sounds like my dog is whining outside the door um all chunky is uh hungry he didn't want his boiled egg this or fried egg actually I don't have any boiled eggs this morning so I fried it with cheese he didn't want it and of course now he's starving um but you all have a wonderful safe weekend I will see you in general chat
