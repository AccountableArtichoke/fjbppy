[Speaker 1]
Recording, just in case. Cool, so, well, I don't really have any updates. We've been trying to get what we can figured out with a smart wallet.

Not on really a development end, but more so with how everything works because we never had basically a summary of how all the functions work and the details of all that. So that's what we've been working on. Oh, that's a cool one.

What was signed? The official agreement with a third party. The most important one that we need to move forward.

Now that the contract has been signed, we are waiting for them to start work. They are on the other side of the world, so in different time zones, but I will let you know as soon as that begins. And hopefully there are no issues there and it's the final stretch.

It was supposed to be there Monday or Sunday, but they're a little delayed, so I think we mentioned or I mentioned on Friday. I'm not holding my breath for exact dates. The dates haven't been for a while, but yeah, I think everything's good as far as that goes right now.

I did, I don't know if Pat's in here. I know I messaged Pat yesterday. If you haven't gotten that DM, please check it on Discord and get back to me.

If anybody else is having issues with moving. Sorry, I'm a little slow today. I think my AC might be getting close to breaking.

Okay, so if you're having issues with moving funds out of your smart wallet, we're trying to get you to test something. So go ahead and DM me if you're also having that issue. I was hoping to get that solved with Pat, but I haven't heard back from him.

So if anybody else is having that same issue and you're willing to try a few things for us, please go ahead and DM me. That would be very helpful. Are all the third parties in sync, meaning that they are all ready to proceed?

Yes. Yes, we just don't have, you know, they tell you something will take X amount of time, and then they have stuff that comes up. We're not their only client.

They have people get sick. They have issues on their development or engineering team. So just keeping that in mind.

But seems like, and I honestly do believe this, with as far as we are now and everything, everybody's telling us we should be able to finish in September. If that changes, I will definitely let you know. But I'm really hoping it's not going further than that.

It kind of sucks because I had a surgery scheduled for mid-month, and I'm thinking I'm going to have to reschedule that. I think I have to do that today. Because I think it might come in the middle of everything, which I can't really do if I'm under.

Oh, that's funny. Greta. Somebody was saying, I don't know how big of a conspiracy this is, because I don't really have a lot of interest around that, but somebody was saying she's actually the baby that they cloned that age matches up.

I don't know if anybody knows anything about that. I haven't looked into it at all, so it might just be a big old actual conspiracy theory. Oh, I was also probably late, but I also noticed the blue ceilings, or roofs, ceilings, the blue roofs.

I haven't looked into that either. I'm not sure how much truth is in that. Has the marketing been planned?

We are working on that. So as you know, so the website graphics are being worked on, hoping we get those this week. Because, and we want to get, that's pretty important, because we really just don't want too much association with FJB for anybody we're reaching out to.

That's one of the main reasons we moved away from FJB, and moving on to a different name, rebranding, so we don't want to be like, hey, this is our website, but by the way, we're switching it. But website, very, very soon, just waiting on the graphics. Everything else will stay pretty much the same.

And of course, people, once they check us out, they're going to know what we used to be, FJB, but it's a lot different than directing them directly to FJB. Haven't been able to even log into the app for months, says I already have, months, says I already have an account, but my account doesn't show up in the top right. Oh, did you change phones?

Go ahead and DM me, because it should, if that's the case, then this changed everything, where then it should email you a code. And once you type in that code, then you should be good to go. But of course, if you get a new phone, or a new device, then it won't show your account.

But either DM me or email. What mediums are planned for marketing? So, marketing, okay, I need to, sorry, I start reading everything that comes up.

So, I think, like I've mentioned before, we are not starting with War Room, just because we need the app completely functional before that happens, and that's where Boris and Steve said they'll get us back on, but we need the app to be completely functional. So, the first, sorry, okay, the first events we have for marketing are going to be in-person events. So, yeah.

Like I've mentioned before, that'll be, a lot of that will also include the merch, just because it gets a little fuzzy there with gift cards and crypto. But it'll be through that avenue. And then, of course, online.

We'll keep you updated. Oh, somebody's not on mute, I turned my sound down so I can never, see, oh, he already did, okay. How will FJB Benefit grow if we are trying to limit association with new app website?

Will FJB be utilized as a medium of exchange? Yes. Sorry.

Gosh, I am so off today. How will FJB Benefit or grow for trying to limit association with new app and website? Will FJB be utilized as the medium of exchange for the payment processor?

Sorry, I had to repeat that for anybody listening. Yes, FJB will be utilized as the medium of exchange for the payment processor. We will have a lot more details on that.

You'll have plenty to read in the white paper. Like I've mentioned before, we are adding political donations, so everything will be, should be great, in my opinion, for especially the upcoming election season. Have influencers and well-known people been recruited yet?

We are, yes, we are using somebody that specializes in that. But again, think of everything. We're hoping, you know, FJB I think for the most part is out.

Not that we don't all believe FJB, and I think even more so with, wow, with everything I've been seeing. I've been seeing a lot from the African-American black community this week. I don't know if that's just the algorithm on my timeline or what, but wow.

That's amazing. I think more and more people are maybe seeing the truth, which is great. I don't think I've got any hands-on questions.

Oh, if you have DM'd me regarding your business, I've not gotten back to you yet. I will get back to you as soon as we have everything gathered for that, so I can provide you with more valuable information. Hmm, Wolverine says it's the Georgia indictment.

Oh, that would make sense. That workshop was huge. That's awesome.

I saw a really funny meme actually. And I couldn't stop laughing, like, wait, I have to add this. Let me find it really quick.

I haven't laughed that hard in so long. Oh my goodness. And it reminded me so much of the community here.

I don't know if you all saw that video that went viral with the gentleman on the left. But I couldn't stop laughing. All I could think about was most of you in here.

Oh, boy. Have any major businesses expressed any interest in being involved? We've actually had some, quite a bit of businesses just here in the community reach out to me from from last week's workshop.

Ed says, probably not a shirt a white person can wear. Yeah, I think it's just like, I'm ordering this, you know, supporting him just to support him. Winston would wear it.

So we had, what was his name? We had somebody here for elections, last election cycle. And, what was it?

Walt Whiter? Blackman, I see. Walter Blackman.

We had him running here, right? The first black American republic in the history of Arizona elected to the Arizona House of Representatives. And he actually was selling a shirt that said, what was it?

Black, Black Guns Matter. And it had a rifle on there. And my husband got a few of them.

And we were going to like a get together with his like sobriety group or barbecue or something like that this weekend. And he had that on. He was like, wait, I think I have to take this off.

But pretty close. Seen one today that had Bill Cosby's face on it. It said, drinks are on me.

What happened? Did Bill Cosby die? Or is he still alive?

I don't think he's still here. First Google questions, what happened to Bill Cosby? So, yes, the website.

There was also a good shirt I saw today. I was like, I wish we could use that. But I don't think Boris would be too happy about it in the merch store.

What was it? It was, it was actually, it was a hat, I think. And it said, kill your local pedophile.

Oh, boy. Awesome. Dev just messaged.

He is starting work that we need for one of our partners. Not a third party. We can still continue.

Even if we're waiting on this work. But that's super exciting. Ed says he's still alive.

Yeah, apparently Google says so. So crazy. Nice.

Social media is looking amazing. As always. I actually haven't watched War Room.

I need to do that.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
How much longer until task reveal? I will let you know. I am sincerely hoping this month.

But I will keep you updated. You all know how that goes. We won't tell B&B.

Oh, well, I mean, I've watched War Room plenty. I feel like I just get in. I used to listen to it when the weather was not deadly out here.

I do. I do. I would go anywhere from like 5 to 10 miles with my dogs in the morning.

And I just put it on, listen to that, which was perfect. Actually, I think that's probably when I slowly stopped. Can't do the walks anymore with how hot it is.

Perfect. Deb says our partners work should be completed by this Friday. That would be awesome.

When you say hoping this month, are you still hoping for August? No, unfortunately not, I wish. But I'm assuming not just because the third party has not started their work and they asked for a comfortable 10 days, which, again, you know, gotta keep, take all the timelines with a grain of salt.

So in case something comes up for them, I'm definitely, and I know I saw a few people saying that doesn't even make sense. I don't know, maybe, I mean, with our, I feel like it does just because I know it wouldn't before being in this space, but they're just telling us it's a solid day to work. Obviously, we're not the only company they're doing business with.

And again, stuff comes up, they have employees go out, you know, unforeseen circumstances. So, I will definitely keep you updated as soon as I get any updates, whether that means we are going live sooner or whether we're still on track or whether we're pushed out. I think it's, I know it's discouraging sometimes, even for me, but gotta remember we are still moving forward, which is great.

Things could move a little quicker, but that's kind of the way that it's doing things the right way versus just waiting for a pump and dump so we could all dump on you. I know that's a lot different than the amount of stuff that had been done in the past, so I do, I do appreciate that part of it. Linda says, penny by Sunday.

Oh man.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I think perhaps I just want to share the white paper with you all already. Just kidding.

We are taking advantage of this time basically getting more eyes to review everything just for the heck of it, just to be safe while we're, you know, while we're sitting here waiting, which I think makes everybody feel a little bit more confident on our end.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
What else, what else? Any other questions? Everybody seems like they're extra funny today.

Maybe I'm just going to sit here and drive them off. All right. I think that's everything.

To reiterate, if you do, if you are having trouble moving funds out of the app, please DM me so we can have you test a few things. If you are still having any issues with the app that you've not posted, please DM me or post them in the app support channel and Discord. We're just compiling or adding to everything to send over.

So once we have devs started on that, they can hopefully just get through that super quickly. We don't expect, we don't expect actually the bugs with the app to take very long at all. You guys have seen how quickly that's worked in the past.

Our last dev made sure actually to make some brilliant changes that make everything a little bit easier. So knock on wood, hoping that still is the case as far as the app bugs being pretty simple. It's just, it's a very complicated on the back end with a smart wallet.

So yeah, I don't think that should take very long. Probably, honestly, what's going to take longer even is probably just rebranding the app and getting new graphics on there and everything after launch. So it'll be first working the bugs, getting everything functional.

Who wants to do that? That's first priority. And then after that will be the rebranding of the apps with the graphics.

So it's going to look very different with a new name. Yeah. And we have some Apple Store and Google play just some routine maintenance that he actually has to do too.

So he'll go ahead and take that. He'll take care of that as soon as he's done with the bugs. But I'll keep you updated on all of that.

I'm not expecting that to take very long because it has not taken long in the past. Very excited to have that working. And that includes getting the app just very, very simple.

We're going to make it as simple as we possibly can. Going to have probably not somebody like my mom because that's, I think, a little too far. But probably something like one of my friends who knows nothing about crypto to go through it and set up.

Okay. So I think that's everything. If you have any issues, as always, tag me, DM me, email me.

Also go. Guys, don't yes, I get most everything from side chats. I get it forwarded to me.

I see the screenshots. I don't care for the personal attacks. That's totally fine.

However, if you are you know, planning on how to sabotage us, I don't care where that is. Then you have, you know, it could be in side chats. It could be in DMs. But if you are doing that kind of stuff, you have no place in the general chats. So I know I've heard like, oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech. We are a business still. Freedom of speech does not come without consequences.

So you are free to do and say whatever you'd like and wherever you'd like. But the consequences of that, especially if you are sabotaging or planning to sabotage us is that you have no place in the general chats. And that is to protect ourselves and to protect our holders and to protect the community and even our future holders.

So just, you know, I get a lot of, oh, freedom of speech. This is communism. This is, I don't think, I think we need a, you know, I think we need a little review on that.

So please keep that in mind. And then again, the main reason really being this is to protect us and to protect the holders, the community and everybody coming into the community. What do we look like if that's happening?

As far as the personal attacks, I don't care until they get very crude and then it's just disgusting. And even then, it's not, it's not to protect myself, but more so you're saying these things to fellow holders. It's just, it's just gross and doesn't really align with our values here.

So, just a little TED talk with that. So, please keep that in mind. Yeah.

If you are, you know, planning to sabotage us in any way, there is no place for you here and you will get banned. There is no question about that. I hope, I hope you understand the reason behind that and I would think that most holders probably agree with that and don't want somebody making these plans here in the chats.

So, there's that. Definitely, again, don't click on any weird links. I think at this point most everybody knows, but you know, it always happens when you're having an off day or you're sick or something like that.

So, please keep that in mind. Don't ever, if it looks like me or Ed or JB or Wolverine, any of the other admins or whoever, just don't ever click on anything or enter your, you know, seed phrase or share that with anybody. We won't ever ask for that.

So, it's been a very long time, I think, since anybody's been scammed and I'm very happy about that. Okay. I think that's everything.

I will keep you all updated if I get any updates before Friday, for sure. Definitely don't think we'll go live before Friday. I will, I think I will reschedule my surgery, though, because I feel like that's going to, of course, line up right there.

Maybe for next month. Yeah, I'll keep you updated on any other updates that come before Friday. Oh, thank you all for his glory.

I need a, I think we, we need for your lots of it right now. So, I appreciate that. I will post this with any notes right now.

Hopefully, it doesn't take me as long. Sorry about last week. I actually ended up somehow converting when I convert the files.

I convert to have an MP3 and I forget the other one. Because some people can't open one file or the other, so I make sure to convert it in this Adobe. And last week, apparently, I converted it into a video somehow and I had 35,000 files on my computer.

My computer just froze. My husband is trying to tell me that everybody has done that at least once like anybody in the video or music world. I don't know if that's true or he was just trying to make me feel better, but that took forever to get those files deleted.

So, I will not do that today. I'll make sure to convert it to the correct file and I'll upload it right now. You all have a great night and I'll see you in general chat.
