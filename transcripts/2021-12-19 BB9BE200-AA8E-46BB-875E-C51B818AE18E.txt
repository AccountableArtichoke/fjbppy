[Speaker 1]
However, there was people saying that I was not doing this anymore. I sold the project because I thought this thing was dying. I don't know what you guys, some people were just making up funny things.

Somebody mentioned, I'm just gonna address some of the things that I mentioned today. Some FUD that I saw was, hey, Prez sold the project because this thing is dying and he has no coins or anything like that. I can't specify the terms of the agreement, but obviously I wouldn't still be here doing every single voice session and talking to you guys every single night, messaging the second I wake up and right before I go to sleep if I wasn't involved in this project in some way, shape, or form.

That's just silly to me. Yeah, we lost to zero, whatever. According to the other party, they couldn't care less because they've been working on this full marketing rollout and the full thing since the start.

What is this, day? We have 56 on Friday, so 57 was Saturday. 58 today, 58 is Sunday.

That is crazy to me. The thing that blows my mind is if you look at the other coins, how many, let's do this. When did SHIB start?

When did SHIB start? SHIB started in August, 2020. It is now December, 2021.

SHIB took about a year. We're on day 58. When did Doge start?

People are like, oh, don't compare it to Doge. When did Doge start? Well, look at the other coins that are getting national news.

Doge officially launched on December 6th, 2013. Imagine waiting six years and then that happens and you get life-changing things that change your life forever. I even know people that were in Doge that their life changed forever.

SHIB, I know people that their life changed forever in SHIB. It's unbelievable. The creator of Doge didn't even wait, except people get so impatient.

And you wanna know the best thing about this? Let's Go Brand is not going anywhere and Joe Biden is not going anywhere because he's still fucking up every single day. And that's what we got.

We have that FJB. I think in 2022, Biden's still not gonna be shitting his pants. He's gonna be even more schizophrenic.

He's gonna be even more crazy. That guy's gonna, he already lost his marbles and he's gonna continue to lose his marbles. So whenever things go bad, people are gonna be like, oh, there's an FJB coin.

We're not going anywhere. I'm just going through my head right now of all of the things that I saw today, things that I can address. Oh, what's the swear jar at actually?

Is today Sunday?

[Speaker 3]
It's Sunday, right? Where am I at? 150, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yep, Sunday. Okay, well, you wanna see, you guys are in here. 160, okay, I got 160.

Don't worry about it.

[Speaker 1]
Look at this. That look like a little bit over 160? Cause I think it does.

That's a milli FJB right there. That's going out tonight. So don't be silly.

I told you guys I'd be donating. I told you guys I'd be doing this. I know I swear a lot.

You know, I've been working. I've been working to not swear as much. I know that I swear a lot.

I'm trying my best. Yeah, exactly. Swear it up.

I'm trying out here. I was talking to, I hopped in the video chat last night with EFSCOMO a little bit last night and there was Donnie in there, the whole crowd. It was a lot of fun.

But keep up the swearing. Cause yeah, keep up the swearing cause I keep donating. So let's do this.

Cause we have, I know that we have a lot of people, a lot of new people in here, which is big, which is huge. I've been seeing a lot of people join the chats, like join Telegram, join Discord. And yeah, the price is going down.

People are asking questions. I'm not able to dictate when the news comes out. I've been here since the beginning saying that news was gonna come out because that's been, that's why I told you guys the other day about what it exactly entails part of it.

Cause you guys are coming at me saying, well, drop the news, drop the news. I'm like, well, I can't do it because it's not me. I'm not at liberty to drop the news cause I don't own the project.

You know what I mean? I'm still here obviously and I'm not leaving anytime soon. However, I can't make those decisions.

People are like messaging me like, oh, do this marketing thing. I don't do that. I'm not the marketer.

It's not me. I'm the middleman. I'm the person in the middle.

You know what I mean? And there's things that are changing. I don't think there's ever been a merger or acquisition in crypto history.

And this one is definitely some big names. So the news is coming where I'm working on a Sunday trying to get this thing going too because I'm doing everything I can on my end to make sure that everything is crossed away and perfectly fine because it'll make a lot more sense and people have been guessing and people know it. People know it.

You know what I mean? But it just gets to a point where it's, they need to make sure that everything's okay before we drop it. You know what I mean?

And on Friday too, we donated. That was awesome. That was absolutely awesome.

What's at any chance before Christmas? I absolutely think so. I've been thinking absolutely, exactly.

People are saying rough estimate. I absolutely think it's gonna come before Christmas. That's the intention.

That's the goal. You should run to the real president. No, thank you.

I'll be the president. I'm still the, I need a new title. I'll change my name sometime this week from Ronald Reagan to something and I'll keep that.

I'll keep that through. KuCoin update. I was actually on with KuCoin today doing some like KYC.

They do a different KYC process for object itself. So in terms of the project, I'm still running the Discord. I'm still running the Telegram.

I'm still helping out with the socials. We have Sun Devil. She's the best.

Sarah's fantastic at the socials. I'm still doing a lot of the community outreach, talking to people about the project, talking to news sources, things of that sort. I'm kind of the mouthpiece of the project.

I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving at all. So don't worry about that.

But the good thing about this too is I'm not the president or the owner anymore. So what I can do is I can be one of you guys. I can pump up the crowd.

You know what I mean? I can be in here doing this. I can be in here sending coins out.

I can be doing all of that stuff. I haven't been the president since the second. You know what I mean?

So you know that like there's a lot of those buy one, get one free sales and things of that sort. So what I'm gonna do actually, because I don't own the project anymore. So pretty sure it's allowed.

I don't think it's ever not been allowed. However, somebody goes up here because I'm looking at the price of this and somebody thinks, hey, this is a good time to buy, whatever it may be. I don't know what you guys want it to.

This is kind of like a Black Friday sale, but it's on a Sunday. I wanna see people buy. I wanna see people sell, obviously.

That's what the project is. You know what I mean? However, I want this thing to keep going.

I want this thing to keep going up. I'm sending out coins. I want you guys to take to the streets still.

I know that we're waiting on the news. I want you guys to take to the streets still. I want you guys to pump this thing up.

I want you guys to keep moving this thing forward. You guys are doing the best absolute job. Please get on QCoin.

Yeah, there's a lot of haters out there. There's a lot of haters and that just happens. It happens, it happens, it happens.

But raise your hand in here if you bought FJB today. Raise your hand if you did that because who's, exactly. If you're new, that's awesome.

If you bought some more, you're adding to a position, you're still here. You know what I mean? And there we go.

See, we have people in here. I like those hands. I like those hands.

I literally have zero USD. So I'm just reading these things. Theories on big whale sailing.

I can't comment on any people selling or buying. I can't comment on any of that because I don't know who's buying or selling. That's kind of the beauty of the blockchain.

You don't know whose wallet is who unless they show and say, this is my wallet. You know what I mean? If people want to get out, they can get out.

That's never been an issue. Just drink water. But if people want to get out, they can get out.

Never been an issue to me. Obviously, people that got in here in the beginning have made X percentage on their returns. They're kind of tired of it.

Exactly, it's been like a no news December. It's been stagnant. I don't blame you guys.

However, we've been working our tail off on the backend to try to make news. And then people come at me for not having news. But newsflash, I haven't been running the show since December 2nd.

So I'm in that middleman spot saying, okay, we need this, we need that, we need this. But they're still figuring out things in the backend. And this coin is not going away.

Again, I wouldn't be here every single night doing this if I wasn't absolutely excited about this. I just saw somebody mention, I'm just reading the chat right here. Shelby Cobra over here, right?

You said that that would be your goal on one milli FJB. Well, here's 100,000 FJB. Thank you for being here.

We hope that you can keep going up. We hope that you can keep increasing your position because whatever you have, if you have one FJB, if you have zero FJB, if you have 100 million FJB, you guys all mean so much to this community and so much to this project. And we just can't thank you enough.

A big tips in here. Yeah, we got some big tips. So I also got a hundred.

So I'm supposed to give it 160K today. I'm giving out a full milli. So we have a full milli over here.

Trying to own 10 milli. Okay, well, if you're trying to own 10 milli, then you're trying to own 10 milli. I wish I can come up here on a Sunday and say we have new news.

If you guys saw that, we had that article come out today. That was awesome. The information was a little bit, I guess, backlogged about what they were saying.

That was written a while ago. It just got released today. We have those articles that are in the, I guess, in the back burner.

Partly, we're waiting to release on news. Partly, they're actually getting, they're trying to get clearance on releasing those articles too because crypto is a weird space right now. Yeah, and something that I saw today, I'm kind of all over the place tonight, but something that I saw today too was about Bitcoin, and Bitcoin's what at?

Like 47,000 right now. It was at mid 60s about two months ago, right? That's down a 33%, solid 33%.

Yeah, people are complaining about it, but people are as bullish as ever on Bitcoin. Yeah, there's some bears there, but I think that, yeah, exactly, Bitcoin's down 30%, but I think that people are still confident that it's gonna go up one day and see at least 100,000. They wouldn't be in there.

They wouldn't be talking this and doing all of this if they weren't here, you know what I mean? That's crypto. Crypto's very volatile.

If you're not interested in that, then maybe crypto's not the game that you should be playing. It's not the race that you should be in. I'm confident that people are in this community if they, one, hate Joe Biden, two, love the Let's Go Brandon movement, three, love to donate, four, like to have a good time.

People are in chat every single night just hanging out, having fun. There's not a second of the day where people don't talk about this, exactly. They don't talk in this chat.

They don't talk in the Telegram. The Telegram's a little bit less active, but the Discord's popping. We have all these channels, too.

New channels coming every single day. I see new channels like Food and Pets and stuff like that. This is a fun place to be.

If you don't want that stuff and this is not made for you, buy some treasury bonds, buy some T-bonds, put your money in a savings bank. That's just what it is, you know? And if you don't wanna be here, you don't wanna be here.

Nobody is holding you to it. You guys probably have a lot of questions. Completely understood.

Things will make sense in time. Rome wasn't built in a day. Nothing happens overnight.

One thing about me, I'm really bad at timelines. You guys have seen that. Whether it was the forks, whether it was releasing TikToks, whether it was releasing this news, I'm very bad with timelines.

I know, the worst. And that's because I get excited. That's because I'm very bad at keeping, I've given all my Christmas gifts already.

That's how bad I am at keeping secrets. That's how bad I am at doing this stuff. So, because of timelines and because of that, I hear something or we get involved in something and I just get excited, you know what I mean?

So then I just wanna tell you like, hey, this is going out, this is going out. You know what I mean? And that's why I've been saying this since the start.

News like this is not one, it's not like a news where you can just like sign an agreement and then boom, you're done and it's out there. You know what I mean? Doesn't happen like that, especially with these types of people.

These are very important and smart, intelligent people that are public figures. The news is coming. I can assure you that.

It's already done. It's already set in motion. It's just a matter of time in terms of getting this thing perfectly ready for the public because when these people touch it, they come out and say, hey, we have this coin.

Wall Street Journal is picking this up. Tucker Carlson's talking about this. Fox News is talking about this.

Even CNN is talking about this. These are not Candace Owens of the world. Yeah, she's great, Candace Owens.

They're not the, I don't know, these other Fleckas or the Hodge twins, the guys on Instagram. Those are not, they're not those people. These people are movers and shakers.

They're big time people. Trying to work on getting this thing the easiest way to buy, aka XT. I don't know if you guys know XT.

XT's been holding iCount hostage for weeks now and it's been fucking crazy. It's been annoying. Oh, I just cursed again, whatever.

It's been very annoying. However, working on it. Qcoin, that's our Super Bowl.

We're getting that thing going. WhiteBit, it's like unbelievable. There's a lot of things that go hand in hand for us to open up in terms of while that happens, we release the news, so on and so forth.

A lot of things are pending. It's like a, you can think of like dominoes that need to fall and as they start to fall in order, then things get released, things get put into place. Exactly, exactly, exactly.

See some comments in here. I'm reading them. I'm seeing some that were just sent right now and comment on those, so take that as a good thing.

[Speaker 2]
That is a very good thing if that's the question that you guys are asking. Let me see what else we got. Let's see what else we got in here.

FJB is definitely a deeply rooted primal chant.

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. Your family's getting 69,000 FJB for Christmas. That's a good Christmas gift, man.

It is a very good Christmas gift.

[Speaker 3]
And some of these, the messages.

[Speaker 2]
Let's read in these.

[Speaker 1]
I'm feeling okay, Carver. Thanks for asking. It's up.

I like the name Grant. Someone said the name and their future son. However, I wish I can come up here and just give you some news right now.

I wish you guys, you guys deserve it so much. You guys, there's no crypto community like you guys, and I've been in a bunch. There's nobody here.

There's nobody in this thing that is worth it. There's no coins that is worth it, in my opinion, that has this type of camaraderie. You see people hop in the chat with FUD or downplaying things or saying bullshit, and everybody comes at them like attack dogs.

It's unbelievable. I love it so much. Can you confirm that we're going to be a part of something bigger?

People are still asking, like, a standalone coin in a vacuum. This is definitely something bigger, something bigger that we haven't seen. I would, again, and I wouldn't be up here saying all of this if I didn't believe it.

So, just think for a second, and I keep saying this too, but just think for a second. If I was done with this coin, I would have stopped talking to you guys December 2nd. I would have just said adios, whatever.

It was fun. It was fun while it lasted. I'm gone.

It's literally not what I'm doing. Community is literally the steam behind the engine, 100%. Without this community, this thing would be toast.

You know what I mean? It's because of you guys, the thing is amazing. You guys are awesome.

You guys are unbelievable, and I couldn't thank you guys enough for everything that you guys have done and you guys will continue to do. Yeah, it's a lot of work right now, but that saying, like, you work hard in your 20s, so then you can chill the rest of your life. I think you work hard the first 60 or so days of a project and then you chill the rest of the project is kind of what I think.

And that's how I look at this. And I look at it like all the work that I've put in, 20 plus hour days, sleepless nights, and things of that. I think of it like it's all going to work.

It's all gonna pay off one day because I'm so unbelievably excited for this project. I believe in this project more than anything else. And this is one of those things that I don't have a plan B because that'll distract me from plan A.

And plan A is this coin. This is my, all my eggs are in this basket. Every single one is in this basket.

I couldn't be more excited. What, I still have, let's see. I don't know where my charger is, actually.

The 919,000 FGB, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. How do I do, like, I'm giving these eggs away.

[Speaker 3]
I'm giving these eggs out right now. How do I do? I'm seeing this.

Air drop, don't tip active. What does that mean?

[Speaker 2]
So if I want to like, oh, because it sends like what, like bullshit?

[Speaker 1]
If you send like, it's bots finesse that shit. Oh yeah, people that come in here. Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of bots in here.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Drew, what's up? What's up, how you doing?

Doing well.

[Speaker 3]
I'm trying to think of the second, 900,000 FGB that I want to send out tonight. Oh, so what's the command? Okay, so it's airdrop.

[Speaker 2]
All right, all right. So it's, but then do people have to airdrop?

[Speaker 3]
If I say like airdrop 100. Really? I don't think we sound the same.

[Speaker 2]
Exactly, go northeast. Wait, so I just airdropped 100,000. Did you guys get those?

Oh, you can enter the airdrop. I see it, I see it. Okay, so you enter the airdrop and it tells you.

I say that's 100,000. How many people is it gonna send it to? Does it have like a limit?

Let's see, give it a minute. Make it shorter. Well, how do I make it shorter?

[Speaker 3]
This is literally the first time I've done, that I've done this.

[Speaker 2]
Drew Solo and I are the same. Drew Solo is a newsflash.

[Speaker 1]
This is a sneak attack. He's actually my cousin. A surprise.

Now the funny thing is, I legitimately don't know anything about Drew. And Drew, I don't think knows anything about me. That's the craziest thing because he's been here every single night and doing all of this.

And wait, Donnie said, wait, what? And he's been here the beginning and he's held strong through all of this. And we have a bunch of Drew Solos in here, but there is only one VP up here.

So Drew, I don't know what your title is gonna be now because I'm not even the president anymore because you're the VP to the former president. So you're like, well, I guess it's like, it's still Pence. You're still the VP to the former president, which is kind of, okay.

Okay, so this is, I think the airdrop is doing this thing. I don't know. I don't know.

Exactly. We'll come up with a new one. All right, but if not, then I'm just gonna start tipping.

Okay, so tip Sherlock. You can like add seconds. Okay, so if I do like airdrop, 100, one, two, three, FJB.

[Speaker 3]
So let's see how that works.

[Speaker 2]
Let's try this. Dropped an airdrop of 100,000 FJB. Oh, and I set a little time limit on that thing, I guess.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, and it's collected. Oh, a whole bunch of people collected that. Jeez.

So how many do you guys get? Do you guys get it like a good amount? Does it tell you how much you get?

Does it split it? I don't know. I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
Just reading. Okay, so split 100. Okay, so it's about 1,000 each.

All right, so what I'm gonna do actually is this. It's 8.57 PM right here. I'm gonna be shooting over, what do I have left?

However, I don't want just people hopping on the chat right now, getting free FJB, people that don't deserve it. You gotta be active. You gotta be out there grinding.

You gotta be out there moving and shaking. I have 719,000 FJB left. I'm gonna be sending over the next 700,000 FJB over the next hour.

You gotta be here. You gotta be working. You gotta be on, you gotta be, exactly.

You gotta be talking in this chat. You gotta be chilling and things of that sort. And if you are, you're gonna be getting in those airdrops.

You're gonna be getting direct FJB dropped. Here, keep working. This voice was kinda, there wasn't a direct plan or a direct, I guess, message tonight.

It's just a thank you for being here. I know the impatience is getting to you guys. I know that it's difficult.

Oh, I'm impatient as ever because I want this thing to succeed more than anybody else. Got a week till Christmas. Merry Christmas, everybody.

Keep this thing going. It's gonna be a beautiful end of December. Love you guys.

I'm gonna keep shooting them over.
