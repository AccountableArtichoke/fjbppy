[Speaker 1]
Hello, happy Friday. Can you all hear me? Yay, awesome.

You want to go back to pump it up? Well, happy Friday. I just wanted to get on here and I didn't get, I don't did want to give just a little bit of the updates we had this week.

So we got somebody brand new on the team. Um, as with the rest of the advisors, um, I can't, I know it sucks. I can't share who it is.

Um, at least for the time being, I'm not sure if that'll change in the future. Um, but it is somebody, uh, pretty prominent that I think will give us, uh, some great connections, um, in the political world. So Dr. K. FGB says he's good with pump it up. Um, so that's a huge deal. He'll be, um, working on FGB with us.

And like I said, I really hope he can get us some awesome connections, um, to everybody else. And of course this is again, somebody through BNB, um, that has been added to the team. So that is very, very exciting.

Um, we are hoping that it will help move everything along a little bit quicker than we have been. Um, as far as devs, uh, like we spoke last time, we're trying to get a few, actually, I'm not sure if I should, but a few different, uh, teams that way we're not just depending on one person per se or one team. And, uh, that we just, you know, have multiple people helping and multiple teams helping, um, in case anything happens or anybody gets busy or, you know, somebody in the family dies or what have you, life happens.

Um, that is coming along great. Um, and then we'll update you as soon as the work starts. FG or FGB marketing wallet sells over the counter tax-free are still happening.

I'm sure if you follow the wallets, you've been seeing that. So still some holders enjoying that, uh, tax-free the tax-free purchases, which helps us out cause then we don't have to sell and, uh, keeps price up. Uh, I think that's all the updates I have.

Um, again, super, super excited. Um, we officially on boarded, um, this advisor today and, um, you know, sent everything over as far as just everything to catch. This is somebody that's been following by the way, the coin, um, for quite a while because he does work closely with BNB.

So he's not completely new to the coin. Um, but I think that'll be very, very exciting. Uh, no, Nate, no.

Uh, if that changes in the future, I would be happy to share that, but yeah, I know. I'm sorry. That's, uh, everybody up there kind of likes to stay.

Um, you sent transparency moving forward. Yes, I, I know. I'm sorry, but I can promise you again, he was put on by BNB.

Uh, so I think that'll help us a whole lot. And yeah, he's a super responsive, super amazing so far. So good.

And, uh, she did. Um, so yeah, let me know if you have any other questions. Um, we are hoping to get the devs started, um, back on the app by early next week, if not this weekend.

So, uh, I think that'll be exciting. What's left on the app to complete? Uh, first we got to get it functioning again.

Some transactions are failing, uh, should be a quick fix. Any other time that's happened, it's honestly been a super quick fix. Um, so we'll start there and then we have our list of the same list we were going off of, um, which I can share again, uh, starting with the showing like the transaction, more details on the transaction history, uh, fixing some bugs, and then we'll go to actual features as far as adding things like the merch store, adding, um, what else?

Donations. I think that'll be huge. Adding donations to political.

Uh, did everyone? Yeah. Yes.

That's awesome. Uh, Dr. KFJB says, does, did everyone notice that crypto tanked and we didn't follow with the trend? Uh, yes.

Decentralize everything with the rebrand. Um, we will update you. I think we'll likely update you with a few different names once we get to the very, very short, short list.

Um, but yes, definitely looking forward to that because, uh, I do believe as soon as we rebrand, I think we'll be definitely more widely accepted at events and, um, just platforms online. Even, um, I think that'll help us a ton and just help people take us a little bit more seriously. Keeping the torch logo, um, that hasn't been decided on.

I, I don't know. I I've not sure about that. How do you guys feel?

I feel like I've heard most people say they want a new logo, especially like with the colors that we have and, but let me know. I feel like that's been the consensus like for the most part is that people want a new logo and definitely not with these colors. I feel like that's the biggest complaint I've heard.

Will the rebrand, the rebrand affect tokenomics? Um, that, uh, it's not finalized. So I think it may, but I'm not sure about that.

I like the Eagle. Yeah. I don't know.

I mean, the Eagle was fun. Too close to another freedom logo out of India. Oh, I think I know what you're talking about.

Isn't it like an education app is the rebrand both the app and the coin. Um, definitely the app. Not sure about the coin because the tough part about the coin is changing forking.

If we need to change. Oh, I missed that from Bob. Did you say new advisors on, um, more so like an advisor behind the scenes brought on by BNB and he's pretty prominent in the political world.

So I think, uh, he'll definitely help us a ton. I'm looking forward to it. Yeah.

That's, I think that's the, that's the, uh, logo I've seen.

[Speaker 2]
Did you say fork?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. If, if we needed to change the name of the coin, we would have to fork. I believe the logo could be a fork.

That's true. No, it's not Eric Finman. Although I love Eric Finman.

He's a great guy.

[Speaker 2]
Prove it.

[Speaker 1]
You guys scared him away. I'm in my backyard. If you hear any weird noises, I figured I should enjoy this weather before it gets hot as heck and like a few days.

I'm going to be salty about this anonymous thing for a little bit. I'm sorry. I'll try.

I'll try to, uh, you know, get him to let it's, it's a guy, it's a male signed paperwork from Bannon yet. No, this is, um, I think, um, the advisor we got on officially today, I think will be a huge help in, uh, helping us move that everything forward. I would love hot as heck.

Tired of winter. Yeah, that's true. But our winter, I don't like when it's cold, cold, but our winters here are pretty warm sitting outside with a t-shirt right now.

Is Barley coming back? Oh gosh. Trauma.

Maybe it's Grant. You guys. Nope.

It is somebody completely new. Um, I believe, although he's been following FJB, he has not been here. I've not heard his name before, and I doubt any of you all have.

We'll find out if he's checked out the chats. I'm not sure he has. Hard to say.

I feel like if he's checked the hat chats, I'm not sure he would have jumped in. Is the advisor an expert in crypto? I'm not sure if he's an expert in crypto.

Um, but yes. Does he know anything about crypto? Yes.

You guys are bad. Friday night, huh? Bob's having fun on this Friday.

Is Weg in jail again? Probably. Let's look for a mugshot.

Remember when he wanted to make an FJB shirt with his mugshot on it, and Boris said no.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my gosh. Excuse me. I'm already hot out here, gulping my water.

I see. I think you guys cleared out the marketing wallet today. We had, I feel like we had a few between yesterday and today.

I think we had a few. Let me see. Not quite cleared, but yeah, pretty well.

Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
What else?

[Speaker 1]
Looks like somebody on Telegram was able to get their coins. Awesome.

[Speaker 2]
He had thought he lost his coins.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Well, let me know if you have any other questions. Um, I know it's kind of late everywhere else.

It's only seven o'clock here, but I know it's a bit later than usual. Uh, somebody on, I think here? No, maybe it was on Telegram.

Wanted it a little bit later so they can watch Bannon on Tim's show. I didn't watch it.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see if somebody has a link.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry. I thought it was over. Bob said he paused it for the voice chat.

Was Bannon already done though? No. Ah, I'm sorry.

Somebody told me after eight, they said eight Central, so I had to Google when Central is, because you guys all have to change your times. Daylight savings.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm. Cool. I'll have to watch it.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. Awesome. Well, if there's not any other questions, I will get off.

Um, again, I'm super, super excited for, uh, the new advisor we have coming on. Um, I'll see if he wants, if he wants to be known or even just come on voice chat or something, that would be really cool. Um, but we're very excited for that and, uh, hopefully everything we're expecting to get approved and go through does.

And I think, um, I think you all will be very happy. I think everything that you've been asking for.

[Speaker 2]
Who was that again? I can't share. I'll see.

[Speaker 1]
I'll see what I can do. Hard to get excited for all these secrets. I know.

I know. I know. Last thing they were saying was that there are records of all January 6th invo, except Bannon's was missing.

Interesting. Did you guys see the, um, I think I saw it on Instagram. I'm sure it's everywhere, but there was a video somebody took of like somebody dressed in black with a face mask and a little earbud.

And he was removing a window off like the Capitol and throwing it out and then tried to blame it on somebody else that was walking up. I think I saw it yesterday. I should have shared it.

I don't think I even saved it though.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see what Telegram's doing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. L bank taking your coins off. L bank will not charge you the 8%.

It just charges you a small fee, but definitely not 8%. If you want to move your coins from L bank to trust wallet or the app, you can transfer that without the 8%.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, that's it. Thank you. Way to people just posted the video.

I think that's it. I haven't watched it, but yep. That's it.

Yeah. Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. It's so crazy that it's everything we knew. Huh?

What about the fact that no weapons seen being brought in only video of weapon being handled out through the window from the Capitol here? Uh, no. FJB Bobby, um, asked you can transfer now from the app without the 8%.

No, that's incorrect. Um, transferring from L bank. If you want to move your coins off L bank to trust wallet or the app, just so your coins are a bit safer is the advisor holder.

I actually, uh, asked that I have not heard back yet, but I will let you know. I imagine. I don't imagine that you're a conservative working in this space and didn't don't hold any FJB.

I feel like even, I mean, I know that even most of the holders, um, at least on discord that say they've sold still have like some coins. They're just not huge whales anymore. At least that's what they tell me in my DMS. So either that or, or they're lying to me, but I do believe it just getting ready to get back in probably. That's also what I've heard from a lot of them too. Maybe this anonymous person will be the catalyst. Um, so the purpose of getting this anonymous person on, uh, this advisor is to help move everything a little quicker, right?

Um, his job will literally be to help move everything along quicker so that we can get, everybody knows BNB are super busy. Their assistants are super busy. Um, this person, his job is going to be is, is what I'm told, um, to be that middleman and, uh, make sure everything is moving a lot quicker from BNB side.

[Speaker 2]
Is it that bucket hat guy with a soul patch? I don't know who that is.

[Speaker 1]
Freedom jobs businesses posting on Facebook as we speak must not be you. No, that's probably, uh, we the people USA above. He does an amazing job for our social media now.

Oh, the war room guy. No, no. That's kind of why we have a designated, uh, FJP personnel versus, uh, all the war room assistants cause they are busy as heck.

And I know they're gearing up for Trump's 2024 campaign that has been confirmed also.

[Speaker 3]
So be king.

[Speaker 1]
You can't hear anything. Um, maybe, well, I guess try accident. Sorry.

I don't know why you can't hear it.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Anything else?

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. As we're wrapping up, don't worry. I recorded it.

Um, we didn't have really any huge updates or anything like that, but thank you. Have a great night. Uh, yes, the India dev, they are, uh, we're waiting on them to let us know, um, about how many hours they're going to be able to allocate per day to FJP.

And that's, uh, as of early, early mid morning, we should be hearing back from them probably shortly again with the time difference right now. I think it's about to be their day if it's not already. And then we'll make sure that we have a few, um, different teams of devs just in case.

So we don't have that issue again, by the way, if you like black licorice, I don't know if I told you guys this, but, and, uh, if you like black licorice, there's a salted black licorice that's amazing.

[Speaker 2]
If I can open the package.

[Speaker 1]
It's so good, but it's, you have to get the good kind from like, I think this one's a German one and they have to add an American, like a English label on it because you can't get American stuff.

[Speaker 2]
It's gross and gross to Bob out.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Well, I think that wraps everything up. Um, as always, let me know if you have any other questions.

Um, if you want to buy straight over the counter from the marketing wallet, also let me know. Um, I think that's it for now. If you're having any issues with the app, we hope to get those resolved this coming week.

Um, we're just waiting on the devs now. Um, if you're having other issues like with L bank trust wallet, any of that, or you're needing any help with that, definitely let me know or, uh, anybody else, you guys have been super helpful in the chat. So, but I think that's all, uh, sorry for the late call.

I try not to make them so late, especially on Friday, but hopefully everybody got to watch the, uh, Tim pool and Bannon on there. I got to get on and watch it. Uh, yeah, but yeah, I think this will be really good.

I hope it helps us move along quicker. I will update you as soon as I can. Uh, if we have anything happened this weekend before Tuesday, I will before the Tuesday telegram call, I'll definitely let you know again, whether it's a voice or it can fit in an announcement.

Um, I won't wait till Tuesday or if the devs can get started before then, which would be awesome. I'll definitely update you with that too. Already have a great night.

I will see you guys in the chats or in the DMs when James pardon. I don't think he wants to be, I think James just want, I think James was trying to get banned, which hurts my heart a little bit, but I get it. Um, not being able to share all the information leaves me the messenger and I understand that's just a part of, you know, part of it.

Um, but yeah, I don't, I don't think James wanted to be pardoned. I think he was trying to get banned just like Russ was. So, uh, when he's ready, I'm sure, uh, he'll be more than welcome to be back.

You all have a great night.
