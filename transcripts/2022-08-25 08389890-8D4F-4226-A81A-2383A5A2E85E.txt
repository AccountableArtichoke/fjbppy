[Speaker 4]
Hello, everybody.

[Speaker 2]
Can people hear me? Can people hear me? Welcome.

I can hear you loud and clear. Wonderful. Thursday evening.

I appreciate everyone tuning in. We have Grant also on the line here. Do you want to speak, Grant?

Is your mic working?

[Speaker 1]
Can you hear me? Perfect. Perfect.

What's going on, everybody? We have 176 people up here. That's a big-time voice.

We haven't had this many numbers in a long time. So I'm excited. I see some people throwing some pictures of me in the chat.

I think I look pretty handsome in those pictures. But I'm excited to be up here. I'm excited to be up here with Mr. Finman. It's tremendous. We have had a ton of people join the Discord. And I'm sure that you guys are – we actually almost had 8,000 people.

Wow. That's almost 1,000 in a week, Eric, if you saw that. But a ton of things going on and I guess a lot of confusion about the Discord and seeing what's going on and where we're at.

And that's what we wanted to do this voice tonight was to address the confusion and just have a quick chat with everybody and let everybody know that we're in great spirits. Right, Eric?

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely. Absolutely. So here, one second, not to talk about technical issues here.

But how do I put you on speaker? It's just coming out of like my – I'm on my phone here.

[Speaker 1]
There should be like a little microphone button at the bottom next to like the Hangout.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, one second. I'm going to join and rejoin.

[Speaker 1]
The Discord can get definitely a little bit tricky over there. But hold on. It's just me now.

We got 186. We got 186. Okay, we got – Eric is back.

[Speaker 4]
187. Let's get to 200. Why not?

Eric, I can't hear you. You might have muted yourself. Oh, still can't hear him.

Eric. Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Well, in the meantime, I'll just chitchat. How I wanted to start this off is we are getting towards the end of summer.

Absolutely. I feel like this summer has been one of those times where you kind of blink and you're like, well, what the heck? We're towards the end of it.

But as you guys all know me, as you guys all know how much I love to give back and how much I love to help people, and I don't want to like sound like I'm talking about myself all the time, but I love charity. And what I wanted to do is because we're ending summer and I'm feeling a little bit generous is I'm going to post something in announcements and we're going to do that big trust emoji on it. And if you put in the big trust emoji, I'm going to put your name into a random generator on Google.

And if whoever it hits, whoever we hit on that random generator, they can pick a charity of their choice. And I'm going to donate $500 of my own money to their charity. So I'm going to throw on the announcements right after this call, I'm going to say, hey, I'm just going to do a little quick blurb, a little quick message, hit that big trust emoji.

You guys know that emoji is my favorite one. I'll throw it in here right now. I'll throw it in there and I'll donate to your charity of choice because I love you guys and because charities are extremely important to me.

And see, there it is. There's the emoji right there. Now we're talking.

I'm going to throw that one in the announcements. All right. I don't know where Eric is.

We're at 195. We are at 195. I know.

Where is Finn? He says, I can hear Finn faintly. Hmm.

You know what? In the meantime, I will go to announcements. I'll say, at everyone, I'm going to say, hello.

This is the message for the charity of choice. I'm going to call it the charity of choice. You know?

It's like the chair of chairs. You ever watch The Grinch Stole Christmas? This is the charity.

This is the message for charity of choice. I will do it by the end of the weekend. I'll give everybody ample amount of time.

And I'm sure that people are going to be wondering what's going on.

[Speaker 4]
And let's say, oh, there he is. I hear him. I'm back.

[Speaker 2]
I'm back. I hear you loud and clear, man. Oh, perfect.

Perfect. Yes. Well, thank you, Grant, for being so charitable and also, you know, being on with me.

We haven't done a dual one in a while. Absolutely. Absolutely.

I miss talking to you up here. I miss it. I miss it.

So, yeah. I mean, just good. Just good to be on the phone with everybody.

Like I said, people kind of were finding me from this Discord. And I thought I'd share it with people. And Grant, again, yes, thank you for being so generous.

I appreciate it. So I want to talk about a couple things today. You know, one is Zash and saying welcome to this Discord.

Welcome. Enjoy. I've been seeing the discussion in the Zash Vinko Ventures channel here.

So amazing, amazing, always debate and discussion with that community. And really, you know, for that group of people, you know, this is a direct line to me. Feel free to talk with me.

And there's also really great people in this community that you should meet and you should talk to. There's obviously a lot of crypto discussion here. You know, I'm working on a crypto wallet that is pretty cool that, you know, people talked about in the chat just as a senior advisor.

And so anyway, I just wanted to welcome people on that. I'm also doing in regards to Zash, I'm doing three interviews if you want to go full in depth Zash and also to the other people on this Discord if you want to learn about BBIG. I know we have a lot of whales here.

Feel free to tune in. I'm doing a live stream with Dark Side Trader on Twitter. Also Wall Street Custodian.

And then also Mr. Rick as well. You can look up those usernames on Twitter if you want to know and learn more about Zash. But this call today is mainly just welcoming people in the community and then also some announcements in regards to this crypto wallet.

So Grant, do you want to make some announcements about the crypto wallet?

[Speaker 1]
Before I start, I just actually, so like I said, I was doing that donation to somebody that does the big trust emoji. By the way, we also have 200 people listening right now, 200 people, 201 people. On top of that, on top of that, someone just reached out to me, he wants to remain anonymous, but he will be matching my donation to the same charity or to another charity.

We're matching the donation. So we just have, that's how tremendous of a community that we have. I love that a lot and I love all of you.

You guys are really, really awesome. You guys are really incredible. In terms of the app, in terms of the app, fully functioning as you guys have seen.

Transact live, Transact thumbs up, double thumbs up. Everything's working out great besides just a minor, couple minor bugs and fixes and plugins that we are fixing and we're doing all of that. Trust us that that's getting done.

The team is working endlessly on that. And we also want to announce that we're going to be adding a couple of great features to this wallet, to the app, because the goal of this app and the goal of this wallet is to be an all in one place for people to purchase cryptocurrencies. And we thought, the team thought that, hey, we want to compete with Coinbase.

We want to compete with these big names out there because this is something that we worked really hard on. The team worked tremendously hard on. And we want to add in some coins.

You want to talk about them, Eric? I can take them. Take them, take them, Grant.

Yeah, so we want to add in Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, whole nine yards to make this a all in one, one stop shop for a, basically, right on your phone, just a wallet that you can buy, sell, transfer crypto, the easiest that it can be. It's so easy for every single type of person to be able to buy, sell, store their own cryptocurrency. And I think that is really remarkable.

There's not, I can't think of many coins out there. The Freedom Drives and Bitcoin being that one that we're doing all of that. And where we're going to interlude next is Eric has some news about an upcoming tour.

Correct, Eric?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I am. So, yeah, one of the, one of the other, I would say this is the third kind of major project I'm working on is, is my path, America's Future. We're going to be doing this midterms tour coming up in, it's starting in September, so really soon, coming up in September.

We're touring the country. We're backing candidates that, that care about the future and technology and innovation. And, and I'm not a fan of TikTok at all.

This is why I'm a big supporter of the app LaMotive, I guess, for obvious reasons over TikTok. I think TikTok's going to get banned and we're going to be talking about that also on this tour. And also, you know, my crypto background.

I am, you know, the, my claim to fame is I'm the youngest Bitcoin millionaire. So I'm going to be talking about this crypto, the Freedom Jobs business app, crypto wallet. We're going to be talking about LaMotive.

And again, this is just in my personal capacities, Eric Finman, in the context of this path. It's not in, not in any other capacity, but I, we're literally, we are between three events. Um, we already got 50,000 RSVPs between three events and we're going to be, you know, I guess I personally am running these tours and, and doing them across the country.

And, uh, and obviously I got to plug my favorite projects as a part of that. So, um, the Freedom Jobs business app going to be exposed to literally, you know, tens of thousands of people at these events. Um, and, uh, uh, and, and obviously, you know, we're going to be talking about banning TikTok and we're having politicians come speak.

And everything, it's going to be fantastic. And, uh, and you know, before any politician can speak, I have to say, do you believe in banning TikTok? Do you believe in crypto?

Otherwise they can't, otherwise they can't speak. So, um, it's going to be amazing. We're doing more than three events.

Um, we're going to be doing even, you know, as many events as possible, even past midterms. And, uh, it's going to be fantastic. So this is, this, I mean, this is a, you know, I guess if you care about, about me personally and all this stuff, this is a big fucking deal.

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. And I think that you're underselling, um, this, this tour that you're talking about, because there's going to be tons of people, tons of eyes, and for you to showcase fantastic app and Freedom Jobs and business, all that they've done and great competition for TikTok.

[Speaker 2]
50,000 RSVPs between three events.

[Speaker 4]
That's a lot of people.

[Speaker 1]
That's a lot of people.

[Speaker 2]
The fuck ton of people. Pardon my French.

[Speaker 1]
No, but I think that's, that's a lot of people and on the horizon, on the horizon. And I know that a lot of people get frustrated. They, they, they want things, um, right now, obviously always.

And I, I, I agree. You know, I agree. I absolutely agree.

Um, but there is a lot on the horizon. There's a lot of things incoming and that's really just the start of it. That's that core, that in-person event.

Give me a lot of them. And there's going to be a lot of eyes, a lot of ears on this. And sky is the limit.

I think that the, the number of people, um, hearing about this, the, I think that the, I just think the word of mouth of that and alone and you going on tour and Eric, you're not for nothing, but I think that a lot of people in here can agree that, uh, Eric is, is only getting more popular and he's only doing so many things that, uh, he's becoming a household name. And I, and I think that's fantastic for us to be here in, in this discord with almost 8,000 people right now. Pretty awesome.

And there's a, there's just a lot on the horizon and I'm just really grateful and really glad to be up here, Eric.

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, and you know, I mean, I mean, you grant, you started that, this crypto wallet, you know, how many months has it been?

[Speaker 1]
It's been, it's been 10 months, man. And, um, 10 months roll of a lot of ups and downs in terms of things working, things not working. And in 10 months, uh, for the people here that, that don't know, we've accomplished a ton and the team has, has done a lot and it's, the team has surrounded themselves and created an outstanding staff.

And it's really, really amazing the progress that we've made. And, and I do feel like it's, it's only the beginning. And especially in a time of a bear market, especially in a time where a lot of projects, a lot of coins really didn't legitimize themselves.

And, uh, the freedom jobs and business project did, and they worked tirelessly. Um, well, a lot of other projects and a lot of other teams, sorry for themselves and gave up, you know? And this is something that created a durability for the long haul.

This, these past couple of months, even, even just to today, you know, uh, the work that was put, it was, it's not, it's not going to go, it's not going to waste the work that was put in was 24 seven.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. You've done a great, you've done a great job on this wallet, man. You've done a great job on this wallet grant.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
I'm excited. I'm excited to, for the, for a lot of eyes to see it because I think that there's been a lot of great people on, on the team and their work needs to not go unnoticed, you know? Absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
So, um, yeah, I just wanted to welcome in this for the long haul in this, in this long haul, um, huddle. I mean, you know, when I got into Bitcoin in 2011, that was, that was always the best advice, hold on for dear life. And that was a years long process and, uh, uh, uh, quite a journey to say the least.

Um, but no, I'm so excited again. I'm just so excited to merge, you know, um, uh, uh, this community, um, all together. Um, also correction.

I'm doing the interview, not with a side trader, but true demon, um, as well. So check out his username, um, correction there. So if any, for any things that are specific, I'm doing a big, very long interview, um, tomorrow on that front, but no, it's exciting on this crypto wallet, uh, uh, Bitcoin Dogecoin being added.

We're bringing it on tour. Um, you know, big, honestly, Zash and, and, uh, although I'm not on the Vinco side of things, I'm only on the Zash side of things. You know, the motive is, is one of the most exciting apps, um, with a lot of big updates soon and a lot of updates in that company.

And I'm excited that my, my favorite communities are all here. Um, it's, it's, we, I think we're developing one of the best communities here.

[Speaker 1]
I think the future of this, of this, um, of this, I think that's, I think that's the most, that's the most important thing too, Eric is we have almost 8,000 people, um, in this discord and that's not a small discord, I'm in a lot, in the past week and, and, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that this is just the, uh, the beginning. When I say like the sky's limit of the discord, I think that this is just the beginning. We've we've, this discord has been around for 10 months now and we've had a ton of new people join a lot of new eyes, a lot of new faces.

And I think that, um, I think it's safe to say that we're going to keep adding people to this discord. I think that this is going to be, I think we're going to create a freedom army. I re I really, really do think so.

I think that this is the start of something new, started something fresh and a lot of unbelievable people in here. And it's, it's exciting to see. The first thing I do every morning when I wake up is I check the discord.

And, uh, for the last thing I do before I go to bed is check the discord and that's not going to change because I love everybody in here. And I think this community is unbelievable and I think it's only going to get stronger, only going to get bigger and only going to get better.

[Speaker 2]
Sounds good. Tune in, uh, tomorrow for, for, and if some of those people must call for any specific updates, but on this crypto wallet, big fucking news, big fucking deal. Have a good one, everyone.

Bye.

[Speaker 4]
Have a great night, everybody. I love you all.
