[Speaker 1]
That'd be right. I actually changed out the earphones. Okay, well, trying the recording again.

Uh, happy Tuesday. That sounded like a fall. Wow, that would be mean.

That's not good. Then I'll be like breaking, uh, what was it, my shoulder or elbow, whatever, that was happening, the portobello. Um, all right, yeah, uh, hope everybody had a wonderful weekend.

I took, what was it, Sunday? I think the rest of Sunday to rest. Oh my gosh, it's a long day.

Um, even with a short flight, uh, I managed to reach out to everybody from Vegas, made some great connections there. Um, probably the biggest one was actually husband and wife. Team with a product, uh, that they're very excited to get onto our app.

It would be the perfect fit, not only for any crypto based community, really, um, but just our model of being able to pay for anything anonymously with what their product is. It's, it's really, I think, uh, so far the most perfect fit as a vendor for apps. They're very excited about that.

Uh, can't wait to show you what that's all about. Uh, our call that we were waiting, that I was waiting on for 24 to 48 hours from the Apple partner. So not Apple, but it's a verification partner.

Um, unfortunately the person who helped me on Friday, I think it was, was less than competent because my called in, um, after 48 hours to get an update, a nice lady informed me that actually he, uh, did not do what he was supposed to do. So she did, um, take the correct steps. Um, and to be fair, he was just following what Apple, uh, included in their email of the steps, basically because we are changing LLCs.

They wanted us, Apple wanted us to create a new LLC. Um, however, the lady I spoke to today, a new account for the LLC, I should say for the new LLC, uh, the lady I spoke today said that does not work that way. And so, um, spent another, I think it was like 28 minutes on the phone for her to get that out.

And, uh, I'm confident that she is, um, but I'm confident that she did the right thing. Cause she sent like seven. That's weird.

Oh, why did I drop? I don't know. Is it just discord or telegram?

Hello. Okay. So where did I lose you guys?

Uh, it's really strange. Why find my neighborhood? Okay.

So, uh, yeah, for the LLC, uh, she informed me that, um, actually they did the wrong. So Apple, it wasn't the guy's fault. It was Apple's fault actually.

Cause their email instructions were to create a new account for this, uh, LLC. And that is not, um, correct. I guess this verification system, they want this, uh, number to stay with you forever.

So since we rebranded from freedom jobs, business to Patriot pay, even though it's a different LLC, they want us, um, that, that number sticks with you forever, no matter what else changes, uh, owner changes, address changes, anything like that. Uh, so I am confident that she did the right thing because, um, actually we spent about the same amount of time as I did with the other guy, but she did send me exactly seven confirmation emails. Um, so I am confident in what she did.

Um, and now I'm just waiting on the verification call. So I will let you guys know, um, she said it can take up to, I think it was, let me read the email to confirm on that, but she says generally it happens sooner. I don't remember if she said two weeks or four weeks.

Um, but that's where we're at as far as that goes. And that's just so people on the app store can search us using Patriot pay. Um, I'm sure you all have seen, uh, our app in the apple app store has already changed or in the, on apple devices, excuse me, has changed.

Um, so we're good there. Um, let's see, as far as our devs that were supposed to be, they had promised me originally Monday, um, they informed me, uh, yesterday, very early morning, um, that they think it's a change now issue. Um, they are in a chat with change now to figure that out now.

Um, however, we do have, devs to back that up as far as our, uh, partner or old partners that we're having some issues with. Um, our attorney is dealing with that and, uh, we, we will be able to move on. Um, sorry about that.

And, uh, we will be able to move on without them. I will keep you guys updated on that. Um, so, and, uh, yeah, I think that's all I have to say about that.

I haven't really received any questions minus, uh, the usual, you know, adding, importing PQI. Um, a lot of questions or quite a few questions regarding some outsiders, um, spreading some false news. Um, I think what's, what's important there, and, uh, I think we're always going to have people trying to bring us down and trying to find, uh, you know, things to point out, things wrong or things we're doing wrong.

I think, uh, what's important to keep in mind there is with everything we've gone through, we're still here. Um, this, you know, when, when we found out of all the missing funds, uh, we sat down and talked about it and it's like, all right, how do we close shop? How do we end this?

And, um, my number one thing to the team was honestly, I think we can rebuild because we have a community like no other. Um, so I would keep that in mind with anybody. And coincidentally, none of these people even hold anymore.

Um, so it's just comical, but we continue to prove them wrong. And, um, again, I think a big part of that is not sure, uh, you know, you could be a realist and I consider myself a realist, but even realists are generally optimistic or pessimistic. And, um, I don't think being a pessimist really helps anything at all.

Um, no matter, you know, all the things that we have been accused of, even if something were to go wrong, even if we've had, you know, devs leave or devs disappear, something happened to them or partners, um, leave or anything like that doesn't matter. We're going to get through it. So for, uh, those, you know, few who are, seem to be getting to some of you, um, and enough just for you guys to ask about it.

I think that's something to keep in mind is, um, everything anybody is pointing out as far as, Oh, you guys are doing this wrong. Are you doing this wrong? It's like any business we're going to go to.

We're not perfect. Um, we're doing something that's never been done before. Um, and that includes that even includes things like, uh, Apple or Google.

I think after COVID, there's just a lot of incompetency in general, to be honest. Um, with the, with the quality of employees in general, in most places, um, you know, if this is something we had done before, we would have known when Apple, when the Apple employees said, Hey, you need to make a new account through this verification system. We would have known to say, no, actually, you know, we can, uh, we actually don't need to do that.

We need to, you know, update the information on the current record with freedom, jobs, business, et cetera, stuff like that. But again, um, this stuff we have never done before. And in a lot of times is things where we're, that have never done before across the board, um, that our devs are doing, uh, prime example being, uh, some major, uh, functions of our contract.

Um, we, you know, who are devs, uh, created from scratch that took a lot of trial and error. And of course, with a blockchain constantly evolving and with software constantly evolving and different chains constantly evolving, there's just so many factors. And those are only the things we can share with you.

Even there's of course, a lot of things we can share with you on the backend, um, and, and changes and, you know, things constantly happening across the board. So I think that's good to keep in mind. I understand, uh, obviously, um, especially if you are a realist and you do have a ton of money, um, that you purchased coins with, um, that it is good, especially, uh, after what we've been through with, uh, the missing funds and all that to, uh, verify.

But I think it's also good to keep in mind that, uh, there are people out there just going out of their way to try to point anything out that we're doing wrong. And I think, uh, again, it's good to, uh, keep that in mind. Yeah.

Yeah, sure. There will be things that go wrong and still we will get through them. So, you know, uh, cry harder, I guess.

I don't know. I don't know what to tell everyone there, but I do appreciate the, um, questions because I'm always here to answer what I can and what I can share. Um, um, how's it going with the smart wallet coins?

Um, again, we can, who's gonna buy Apple with me? Wow. Um, smart wallet coins, we have not airdropped to you guys.

We don't want to airdrop to you guys until we have, uh, that all figured out and fixed. We just don't want to airdrop it to a wallet that's been not usable. So I hope that makes sense.

Um, can you just make the Apple app button on the website not clickable and mark it Android app? Uh, yes, but we need our smart wallet, uh, fixed. Um, let me check on that.

Uh, I will, I will answer DMs right after, but if you want to quickly do it, YouTube, just search PatriotPay or even Google PatriotPay YouTube or Rumble and, uh, the videos to import PPY are right there. Um, long explanation. No, I've just been getting a lot of, uh, questions I'd rather answer on a voice chat instead of taking the time to answer so many people constantly.

Uh, no, I did not actually.

[Speaker 3]
CHV is, uh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
It's between 14 business days and 30 business days and they actually even put, uh, 14 business days is Monday, April 1st and 30 business days is Tuesday, April 23rd. So, uh, between April 1st and April 23rd is when they should have their part, but she did say, um, a lot of times it is sooner than that. So we'll keep you all updated.

Um, just need to have access to the dashboard. When request changes have been resolved, please allow up to 24 to 48 hours for your updates to be fully generated in our system global. Okay.

Yeah, she was very nice. Uh, no, the devs did not say how long because, um, how many partners are not helping? Oh, just one.

Okay. Okay. Nothing here.

Uh, we are estimating, and again, take this with a grain of salt because you guys know how software, uh, development works. Um, but with a partner we're working with, uh, we are estimating end of quarter three for our own on-ramper. I will keep you updated on that.

Why are you eating chips? Having corned beef and cabbage for dinner. And carrots.

And I made a gluten-free soda bread. Yeah, so a few DMs. It's funny, sometimes I feel like the same kind of DMs come in in one batch. About, if you don't, if you have a app account and you don't have funds into that account and you can't get into it, you should make a new one.

If it were me, I would just wait until the app is fully launched and we have our new login and wallet creation. System integrated. Because you really can't use it right now anyway, so yeah, that's what I would do.

Exchange rate for PPY on change now seems crazy high right now. Oh, I haven't checked. I'm not gonna lie, I miss, I miss buying.

I miss that too. Can you tell us more about our own on-ramper? Yes, we are just, and as we continue, to make our app as self-sufficient as possible.

And we'll continue doing so because we do imagine that. Ah, shoot, my Wi-Fi again. What is going on?

No, it's just Telegram. My Wi-Fi seems connected. It's so odd.

What is it? Yeah, everything else is, um, it's nasty. My neighborhood has been having major Wi-Fi issues for months.

Hello? Sorry, I don't know why my Wi-Fi is having trouble. Actually, I do now.

It's, it's my neighborhood, like, since December has been having crazy Wi-Fi issues. We're cocks. Can you all hear me?

Let me make sure your Discord muted me again. No. Sorry, I don't know what's up with my Wi-Fi.

I hear somebody, but I don't see anybody. I think it should be muted. Um, yeah, sorry about that.

But, uh, yes, so our own onRamper, again, is, uh, we will continue to make our app as self-sufficient as possible, um, because you just never know. We know companies get bought and sold and, you know, acquired anyway, and, um, change owner and change hands and maybe change policies and, who knows, maybe we get larger and, you know, somebody freaks out like they did at Wire. Um, that's so weird.

Who am I hearing? I hear who these are. Oh, no.

Um, so, yeah, that's where our own onRamper comes up.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Um, how about SDV? Coming by for five minutes to make sure we are on track and are golden and all these toys. Doesn't hear the owner calling the shots.

He will come on as soon as he is able. Is own onRamp owned by this LSE or immigration? Uh, don't think that's been discussed yet, but I will keep you updated.

So, now you're saying 2024 third quarter for our own onRamper. Yes, uh, that's, it's very early discussions and that's the, uh, timeline we've been given. Um, I will update you as we get updates and, again, many, many, um, factors there.

So, we'll see how that goes, but we will continue to be as self-sufficient as possible, which is, uh, great. That's, uh, that's really the goal. Are we still looking okay for a March app launch?

Uh, we should have everything wrapped up, um, from our first quarter. Um, the last, I think the number one thing we'll be waiting on is the, uh, app off change. Um, yeah, I, I can't say too much about that, but that's, uh, basically Smart Wallet, but everything else, uh, everything that we have more control of.

If, if only I knew how to, um, be a dev, I think I can get that done too in time. Uh, an alternative to Vess was found and tested. Yeah, that's complete.

Absolutely. Wonderful. I'm sure everybody will love it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Inserted DMs. Get those, uh, inserted as soon as I get on. Okay. Uh, so is this a yes or a no?

That is, uh, I will keep you updated. Right now, we should have plenty of time, but, again, it's, um, it's hard when you don't have, um, everybody cooperating, especially when you've already paid them. Uh, so I will keep you guys updated.

Again, they have found an alternative, but the devs, um, can only do so much. Mm-hmm. What else?

What else have you guys been up to? I'm really trying to make it before March 27th, but I don't know if we'll have time to actually sign up for this event. Like, the app would need to be ready before we pay and sign up, um, but that would be awesome.

Uh, if not, their next one, I think, was in April. Let me see. It was, uh, it was Jake.

That's his name, I think. Yeah. Um, next one after that is April 3rd.

Then we have April 25th and May 7th, and those are awesome, um, very targeted opportunities that I think we'll be doing. Um, these are all TPSC events.

[Speaker 2]
So, mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
I should have, uh, taken a video, actually, uh, at the conference this weekend. Um, one guy was a software developer, and, uh, he was on stage, and his talk was regarding, I forget actually what his, he was going on, um, but one of the things was, uh, that they all, oh, I know what it was. It was, um, on integrity and honesty and how sometimes, um, running a business, you have to do things that are right, even though it's hard, and even when you don't want to, um, to keep people's trust.

And, uh, one of the things, because he was in software development, was, like, um, software changes a lot, and there's problems you run into that you had no idea you would, and timelines change, and, uh, costs, like, you know, cost ality estimates change, um, and it's difficult because they have to then explain that to their clients. Um, so, after he was done, I'm like, oh, I should have recorded that. See, it's not just us.

But that's why, uh, that's why a lot of times with things like this is because, uh, devs are trying to solve an issue, but they, I mean, they're trying to solve something. They have, they have no idea what the problem is, and there's so many components tied into the app, from change now, from our on-ramper, from our off-service, from this, uh, from the smart wallet, uh, contract, from freedom factory, um, you know, changing, uh, the agent. Sometimes that when Bella was around, he just used to periodically fix that, or, uh, change that, and just, uh, start a new one.

Uh, just so many components, uh, even though it seems so simple on the front end. So, I know it's super frustrating, but, uh, how long have devs been working on the smart wallet? Has been weeks or months.

Oh, boy, I'd, uh, I've lost count, but our last, um, our last deployed and completed update and tested and ready for you all is the most current one, is the one with our new on-ramper. Um, before that, was it our off-service? Our new off-logging and wallet creation service, I believe.

Before that was the PatriotPay integration with the Polygon. So, those are all the ones that are ready, um, minus some smart wallet issues with that first one. No, the robot did not recommend freedom factory.

That was a Velo idea. By the way, Velo comes from the Velo-per. Was there something that changed on the app yesterday?

People were talking about it. Um, possibly, the devs could have possibly deployed, um, something, even if it wasn't supposed to be deployed, if that makes sense. Oh, let's see what we have here.

Oh, by the way, I've just seen several of you claims, actually. I'll do that. Let's see.

My battery died, and apparently, my car went into transfer mode, I think it's called. Does anybody else, has anybody else dealt with this? It's super annoying.

Apparently, uh, a common function of my car's, uh, make, and obviously, and it just shuts, like, so many of the functions off, even though you can drive it, and so now, such mechanics. Hoping to reset the, uh, computer on that. Um, where does the app pull coin data pricing from?

Bitquery. Oh, are you familiar with that? No, it's a BMW, but I'm sure, um, probably other cars have the same function.

I don't know, I've never had this issue before, and I've, I've had a lot of dead batteries, and apparently, what it, the purpose of it is that when cars are being shipped, that if the battery dies, it stops, like, everything from going on, like, uh, you know, your alarm, and all these things, like the AC, and so it'll blow air, but not cold air. My AC won't, like, light up. Super annoying, and it's already super hot here, so we have a little bit of a situation, although at least my battery is under warranty, but what you have to do, well, at least for my car, is you, uh, my internet is on, are you serious?

What is going on? This recording is going to be so weird. I apologize in advance.

Oh, that's nice, I'm reading these for the first time. Steve retired living in Delaware. I'm just waiting for this, uh, Wi-Fi to get back on.

Back, uh, sorry about my Wi-Fi going nuts, apparently, today. Have you tried disconnected battery for 30 minutes? No, I've not, but that's exactly what I did, um, so BMW instructs you to take out the battery, remove the plus, remove the minus, um, cross your battery wires, um, and leave it for at least 10 minutes, so I tried 10 minutes, that didn't work, so what I did was just leave it at my mechanics, crossed, and then I'll go back tonight, and then put the battery in there, and hopefully, it resets the computer, otherwise, I have to go to the dealership, and apparently, they can reset it. I tried resetting it with, uh, his computer, but it did not work, so hopefully, I'll have the car again soon.

Um, okay, let's see, um, email, that's all the questions I had, sorry about my crappy connection, my neighborhood's been, they're adding, um, like, I don't know what it's called, some fiber, something, so one of you guys want to hear what I'm talking about, uh, so apparently, that's why we're all dealing with issues while they, uh, app that, um, but I think that's everything, if you all need anything in the meantime, uh, feel free to reach out, please do not share your seed phrase, or click on any weird links, uh, none of us will call you, neither me, or any admins, or any devs, or anybody, not Steve, not anyone, of course, I will keep you all updated if I hear anything before Friday, for sure, um, I am actually in talks right now with another dev to come on, um, the smart wallet is such a, such an awesome feature, but it's not, uh, the easiest to work with, so if anybody you know is a, uh, expert in React and Web3, feel free to reach out, and you can, uh, work specifically on the smart wallet, we have enough work for them there, yeah, I think also one of our devs is, like, his family member is in the hospital, and our other dev, like, you know, life, um, so I will keep you all updated on that, but again, everything else in our quarter one should be all good by the first quarter, and I'm, uh, I'm excited about that, our education segments, oh, I think I'm going to do a poll on those, actually, on the education segments, or maybe after we already, like, have them, we'll make a poll with, um, the same, like, the two styles we're thinking about, and see what you all prefer, but again, it's kind of not geared towards you all, it's geared, like, towards our parents and grandparents, so that might be different, too, um, that's weird, all his boys, uh, did the devs bring his arm again, I did not ask, something in the hospital, but I think it's for his family member, not him, uh, what point will a third-party smart wallet be used while teamwork's on their own version, um, we will not be using a third-party smart wallet, because the one with, that comes with one of our partners, uh, doesn't work on as many, uh, networks that we need to, to work on, so I'm sure, probably right by the time we're done, they will be, but again, trying to remain as self-sufficient as possible, but, uh, with the partners we have, they don't have all the capabilities that we need, and if it does continue, excuse me, if it does continue taking very, very long to figure out the smart wallet issue, what we'll do is just, um, offer the expert wallet while the devs continue working on that, uh, to get it wrapped up and, uh, start working, okay, I think, I think that's everything we've got, um, yeah, I don't think that's everything, what is the next task that will be completed, uh, there's several, I think that'll all wrap up at the same time, it is, uh, which is everything in wrapping up quarter one, uh, have you considered a bounty program to incentivize devs to get shit done, um, if somebody can find me, our dev, Noman, I will pay you, I'll pay you a thousand dollars, I'm not joking, um, define, find, contact, successfully get in contact with, um, Noman, because I, I really think he may have maybe passed away, but I'm hoping that's not the case, um, but, because it's weird, his, he had, he had very, he was very, like, doxed, um, he had a bit, several, like, dad, he was on several dev websites, um, and all those profiles, like, I've been stalking them, um, during the year he was gone, and they were just inactive for the long, and then once it hit exactly a year, those profiles were wiped by the service, because they were inactive for a year, um, I did try, thought I had found him, because I found his birthday, and I found a phone number of somebody I contacted, but he was, like, an angry old man, apparently with just the same name, I don't know, but he was not, um, he was not very nice, and he kept telling me I was a scammer, um, but yeah, I will, if somebody can find Nolan, uh, he was a smart wallet expert, he definitely got that quick, and did it well. Okay, here says Nolan, Nolan could, you can clone him, probably, um, I've got devs, they're super high demand right now, it's just hard, because we need somebody that specializes in react, so we've, we've interviewed a ton of devs, um, not just last week, I think the two weeks before, specifically, um, like a ton, it will be increasingly during the past few months, but those two weeks, we had so many interviews, and it's just hard, because of course, a lot of them do want work, but we also don't want anybody that's not qualified, like, oh, you, you know, you can learn with us, but we need, uh, somebody who's interested and, uh, competent to work on the smart wallet. Oh, I didn't hear about that, I actually, um, have been meaning to look at crypto conferences to, um, send, send some of our team to, right now, if you guys ever see, uh, things, conferences, conventions that you think would be useful to us, um, definitely send them over.

This last one was, um, awesome too, definitely a lot different than CPAC was, because it was all pretty much business owners, but that's great, because that's a lot of opportunity there too. Definitely, I think definitely got us at least one vendor for the app, several more that we're interested too, but like, this one, the most solid by far. Um, okay, well, I think that's everything.

I've just got to work on, let's see, work on prizes tonight, probably start another contest for Friday, um, the merch store, if you've been asking about that, um, gotta do some accounting stuff, bookkeeping, I guess, um, taxes, yeah, I think a few things tonight, but I'm here, so let me know if you need anything, reach out, I know I've been quiet in the chats, but it's, uh, been very busy in team chats, so I think that just like, you know, gets it all out of me, um, but yeah, I'm gonna get this recording up here, actually, I'll probably do it before I get up, I almost always forget when I go to eat first. Who's the winner selected from the competition tonight?

Oh, we can do that, let's see, how many people are there? We can enter it into a, um, general, oh, we're, we're, um, oh, actually, I'll update you on that as soon as it's done. Um, oh, yeah, apparently Rumble is requested to acquire and operate TikTok within the US, I wonder how that's gonna go, um, okay, let's see how many shares do we have, okay, we have 14 shares, um, okay, um, so we have 21, I guess, let's, here, let's put in two, and then we'll just see if the one that it picks is one of the, one of you guys, one through, what is it, 21, January 13, okay, so I'm gonna go down the list, hopefully, it's one of you, otherwise, we'll just have it pick again, one, two, three, 13, it's Daisy Kate winning, hey, I know who that is, okay, oh, I guess I have two screenshots, because I have, I have the one from my post, whoop, back to me, oh, can't screenshot my, uh, Instagram anymore, because after I started following you, it brought you to the top of the list, so that's not gonna be, but I'll, uh, I'll add this screenshot, I'll follow everybody else, though, let's see, let me find the contest, I'm out of here, perfect, oh, there you go, thank you, oh, my gosh, my Wi-Fi out again, boy, that's a record, all right, I'll post the recording in just a few, I'll end it here, um, sorry to all you listening to the reporter, um, about my connection, you all have a great night, uh, we'll talk soon.
