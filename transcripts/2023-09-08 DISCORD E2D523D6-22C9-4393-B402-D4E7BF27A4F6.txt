[Speaker 1]
Let me get the recorder going. Happy Friday. I hope you all had an amazing week.

My week has been long. I'm glad it's Friday. So, I did get quite a bit of questions today.

Sorry, somebody's asking. I have three voices on right now. Okay, so I did get quite a bit of questions today.

I'll go through those first. I think most of them came from Telegram. I'll start with Nolan's.

Sun Devil, when will the third party start on the task and what is the deadline? You've stated that one or more legal documents were signed relating to this third party. Correct.

What penalties for not meeting work completion deadlines will be imposed on this third party? There are no penalties for not meeting work completion deadlines. We do not have a deadline.

Guys, we need to remember here that we, well one, we've made quite a bit of great negotiations actually with this third party and we are honored for them to honestly still want to work with us and do what they are doing, especially with the rates they've given us for the future that were agreed upon in this contract. This is after scouting several third parties. So basically start with that.

If no penalties were included in the contract, why was that decision made in light of previous experiences with contractors and third parties? So that decision was made because again we have close to zero leverage. This company is much bigger than we are and we need them much more than they need us, to put it lightly.

What they are doing for us and the rates they are giving us are really just phenomenal and our community will definitely benefit from these going forward. The team is thinking of everything long term. It would be super easy of us to launch and just make this very close to really or similar to what it was before as far as just a pump and dump and for us to make tax dollars and transfer them out and spend those and move on until the next pump.

But the team is really looking more towards a long term and how this would impact the coin and holders long term. So again to summarize that it is because of the negotiations that we did agree upon with this third party that took priority over time over getting this. Of course we'd like this to get done sooner than later.

Nobody wants this launched more than I do. Literally nobody. Nobody on the team.

None of you. I can promise you nobody wants this launched sooner than I do. But we do everything that has been stretched out time wise has been for a reason.

Unfortunately we can't always share every reason and I wish we could but it is for the benefit of the holders and the coin long term. I think after launch we'll be able to share most of those reasons actually. Additionally this is still Nolan.

Do you have copies of signed contract documents relating to the business operations at this time? Yes I do. Or are signed and executed copies being held by your and based upon previous statements you've made FJB's shared legal?

Yep me and our attorney. Both of us have copies of these legal documents. We've had our attorney review them before we sign them even though they are pretty straightforward documents.

Let me get into general ICMP. Hello. Okay let's move on to the next question in my DMs. When we fork to Patriot Pay will we have an identical amount of burned and coins as we do right now?

When we do decide to fork we will decide that. It would be much easier for us to keep the same amount of coins and to keep everything even and airdrop the same even amount of coins. However I do not know for sure that when we do fork that is what we will be doing.

Again that will just be the easiest thing to do but I will update you and I will update you if that goes differently. I'm not sure who Donald which one of you is Donald on telegram called me today or tried to call me today around 5 30 eastern. Okay then we have the next set of questions.

Okay there's a lot of confusion regarding the status of the project. Are you able to give us an update summary of everything relating to the task? Okay I assume these are the questions.

Have you been provided with an update from them? I'm assuming this is the time estimate from the third party. Yes I have.

When will the third party begin their work? So I guess I guess these answers will actually cover some of my own update. So right now the third party is saying it will take them at least two weeks to start work to begin work and as you all know before they estimated they wanted 10 days to complete that work and that's this is out of well okay let's read these questions first and then I'll give my updates.

When will the third party begin their work? What do they actually need to do? I'll update.

I can't really answer that until we're already live and then everything will be shared then. If you don't know why don't you know? I'm assuming that's relating to begin their work.

We don't know because we've not set up a party and they have plenty more clients to work with than us so that's just you know that hasn't set. Like I said other negotiations took priority over timing because we really are grateful for them still willing to work with us and the negotiations we have made with them. We've gone through plenty of third parties and whether those are simply not compatible with us, our contract, our blockchain, you know different states we need to operate in, how our app works for one reason or another.

Plenty of third parties said they'd be able to work with us but when it came down to it just it was not possible just due to how everything was set up on our end or their end or things that neither of us could really control. This is why this third party is critical in this and everything we're doing now. We really need them more than they need us.

I hate to say that but it's the truth and of course our goal is to grow enough that we have that leverage where third parties want to do everything they can to be able to support us and our contract and our app but the reality is with everything we've gone through and our charts and our budget and our volume. Basically that's what I can share right now but do know that this isn't the lack of us not thinking that through or the team not thinking this through. It's simply that these companies that we really need them more than they need us that's honestly what it comes down to and of course again our goal is to grow the community and grow our volume so much that that changes but for now that's in the position that we're in and again the negotiations they have made for us as far as their rates and the volume goals are absolutely what we needed so that took priority over timing although of course we want to get this sooner than later and we want to get this completed sooner than later and again nobody wants this done sooner than I do.

The priority is to make this to give us the highest rate of success but also really learn from all the mistakes in our history that's happened in the last almost few years now and make sure that if there's anything we can do to prevent that with these contracts with third parties or in the work that the devs working on every detail has been thought about by the team and that will become clear once you all the video is being worked on this first video that's being worked on is actually for specifically for you all in the community so it's not for social media it's not for perspective holders it's for you all and I think the details in there will once you all finally get to see all that you will see how the team thought of every single detail and to prevent us from going through most of the things that we've gone through and learned from and using that as a learning experience to benefit us in the future. Moving on to the questions. Did the contract stay to completion date?

Nope it did not. What is the actual status of the app? Okay great question.

So the app we have two separate entities working three separate entities now actually as of today working on the app. So what's been so difficult about the app is we've had devs that are no longer with us. It's a little complicated in the way our source code is and now we finally have our own github we will go ahead and launch that but basically it's a little complicated to how everything's been worked out we don't exactly have a document on how everything works so we have these brand new devs that are reviewing and trying to piece what they can from looking at this code.

I know it's been a lot more complicated than I thought it would be but we the good news is they we have decided the team has decided that they are working on the app while that while we wait for the third party to do what they need to do and that is strictly getting the bugs worked out. If you've been one of the few people that's having issues with the bugs as far as not being able to transfer your funds out having failing transactions as far as those you know I've contacted you tried a little bit of troubleshooting through some things our devs are trying to work out. I think that's great news that way that helps some of you who just want to be done and want to walk away from FJB and just trying to get your money out.

I think there's actually one person I know of having that specific issue if you also are having that issue please dm or tag me or email me so we can get that squared away but that way we don't feel or you don't feel that we are holding you hostage we're definitely not trying to do that and that way we can get you and your money out of the app if you are not wanting to stick around. So that way we can get that taken care of yeah and I will keep you updated on that with any updates I get. We understand from previous voice chats that this is being worked on however as weeks roll into months why hasn't this work being completed?

I'm not sure if this is regarding our task or the app. If it's the app it's because most changes on the app need the task to be completed first otherwise we'd be just having the dev do the work twice as far as doing the work on the app now then the task being completed and them having to redo that work. When will the app be ready?

I don't have an answer for you because so far the devs have not found what the bugs actually are. Again this is a little bit difficult because we are still cleaning the mess that we were left with. It is unfortunate but again we've used that and the team has chosen to use that to the best of our advantage by making the changes we have made which of course has caused us to go on longer than we expected but again they are thinking of every detail and really trying to avoid most issues that we've ran into before through making some changes through this task.

There was and I'm sorry guys I'm running through these dm questions. I see the questions coming in general chat. I'll answer those after.

There was an expectation that despite all of the delays over the last five months that it was likely the project would launch on war room in September. How does that now look? So that hasn't changed much.

September has changed but I have stated for a while now that we and I am told by Steve and Boris that we will be launching on war room once we have our shit together. That has not changed and we don't want really don't want to launch on war room before our app is 100% simple and functional. Otherwise I think that would just be a waste of everybody's time.

We don't want any more unhappy holders. Simple as that. To be honest it doesn't look like that'll be happening in September.

Again Steve and Boris want us to be functional. They do not want another wire day. So yeah that's I think my answer there and I think I had one dm on discord.

Somebody oh this is just somebody that was banned. Has their coins on xt. Okay if you're the person who dm'd me with their coins on xt it's not clear from your dms if you're trying to move them out of there.

So please uh answer my dm backs. Was I put on timeout for something? I won't call Finn a lesbian anymore.

Oh um okay well yeah so you kind of already know I guess. Okay let's answer these questions. Are Grace and Mo still amped about this project when Donald Trump Donald wow Trump uh to get fjb tat.

Oh wow not a wag huh? Are you taking wagers? Okay uh still feeling confident task reveal this month.

We are doing everything we can. We are paying multiple devs to be on the same task. Uh I do have great news as far as um so the third party um starting in at least two weeks which gives us two weeks time.

We are adding something to the task um and we have two sets of devs on it um and this this will add see how do I say this um this will prevent us from having to wait this long for these kind of changes in the future. Um so while we wait the two weeks for a third party to start um the task and that that's when their 10 day estimate would start um we'll be working on that and uh this adding this to the task again will prevent this longer wait in the future of any future changes we need to make. Um I think it's brilliant and um again it'll be shared once we're live.

Uh universal fun oh I don't know what that was about. Should we expect some tax wallet cells to fund the work? That is going on soon.

Uh probably we'll probably have a few cells before task is live. We do have a pretty healthy wallet to pay off um two of our devs except Crypto. Uh the third one they get paid through Zelle so but we'll probably make a few more sales before we go live.

Russ says I'm good with Frankenstein coin. Um which will finish first the third party task or the app? Uh that really depends so it's a little difficult.

Okay so as far as the app goes um as you all know our original dev uh so we didn't we don't have a written summary of how everything works. Uh that's just made it a little bit more difficult for anybody else working on it. Um and then as you know our gnomon he kind of disappeared which was very very sad.

I'm still sad about that. If anybody finds him um please please let us know. I know no one hasn't updated me on that.

Maybe he needs like a merit. Hey I'm not above marrying gnomon to uh get us you know give them his visa. He was he was a US citizen I thought though.

We confirmed that but I don't know maybe something happened there. If I need to marry gnomon to get him to working on back on the app I will do that. I don't know how hard that is nowadays.

Some of you are married to foreign women. Let me know but somebody needs to find him first. Um so that's kind of what's made that a bit harder on the app side.

Um but like I said we have continued to troubleshoot with a few holders that are having those issues. Uh we've tried to reproduce those bugs. I haven't been able to.

Unfortunately my app on apple is now showing that circle the blue circle of death in the left corner. Um so I can't even try to reproduce it there. Um we have the dev trying to reproduce that and then um we'll get there.

I have I have faith we'll get there. Are the devs working full-time finding the bugs and fixing the app? Um so we have one dev.

He is wrapping up a task for one of our vendors and then we have two other sets of devs. One being good company. They have three different devs working on this um and we are not hourly with them so I can't exactly answer you as far as uh full time but their estimate is under two weeks for this edition.

And then we have two set uh it's a team of two devs um working on uh looking at the error logs and figuring out the bugs. So it's it's nice because we have slowly grown the team of everybody working on this.

[Speaker 2]
Um yeah let's see I think that's all my DMs. I think that's everything.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh reserved risk is back. Those are some cool photos. When fork happens will that be a one-for-one drop?

Um when we do decide to fork uh it would be easiest I'm told by the team to do a one-for-one airdrop but that has not been decided on. Once we do get closer and that's been decided on uh you all will know that would be easiest just because then we don't have to do any calculations. Nobody gets shorted.

Nobody gets overages and it's a lot less math. Although I love math. It's my favorite subject but I think it's a lot less headaches with as many wallets as we have.

Uh oh I didn't see this. Uh third party to start their implementation within two weeks and this could take up to 10 days to complete i.e. another 24 days max. Uh that is what I'm being told right now.

I will update you as that happens. Um to be honest I am not holding my breath for dates as I've said for a while. That's happened since August of uh 2022.

I know how uh most of these crypto companies uh seem to operate at this point. Stuff comes up. Stuff takes longer than expected.

Um so I hope more than anybody that that stays true but I'll keep you updated. Multiple devs reviewing code and trying to fix. This is expected to be completed within two weeks.

Uh no we have no we have no time estimate on fixing the bugs in the app because at this point we still don't know what the bugs are. The devs have not found the bugs. We have trouble shot with a few several actually holders now um and nothing that they thought it could be is what's uh wrong so far.

Can AI write new contract and help devs get this done? Apparently uh I actually asked the team that and apparently AI is still far far away from that. Not quite there yet.

But if we were writing a new contract I think it would need to be a lot more complicated than that with uh our team being as uh choosy as they are. Anyone discussing building the app from ground up? Oh god no please don't don't give them ideas.

If you guys think this is long let's not give them ideas. No way. Now our dev uh Bello did uh Bello, Spesh, uh I think those are the two who worked on it did some great work and um it's it truly is a great app um and I know that's hard to see from your perspective as just a user seeing the front end of that but it really is a lot more complicated than it seems on the front end and I know we've joked about the smart wallet not being so smart but it really comes down to I've learned uh through our team um that it really comes down to a few just very fine details of why things aren't exactly working as they are supposed to um but our app I mean it truly is brilliant and you know the smart wallet working as it is it's just uh basically it comes down to a detail like the smart wallet is supposed to estimate how much gas right so it's on it's on the system uh basically a pay it forward for the gas right so the user in front of you uh pay you know has their gas paid for well now they pay for gas out of their transaction and that gas is supposed to pay for you and then you know so on the the gas you pay is going to pay for the next user the detail is in the smart wallet estimating how much gas that you need and how much gas you will pay um and it sounds so simple um but this is really what needs fine tuning um and better estimation um just to estimate that a little bit better launch in 2023 yes I am very very very hopeful about uh launch in 2023 absolutely AI did the work of 200,000 doctors in 10 minutes what kind of work is that is all this gas like cow farts what's he doing on tv where I don't really watch tv I I literally don't even know how to turn on any of our tvs we have like one two three I I kid you not I do not know how to turn on our tv that's how much little tv I use uh south dakota rally start showing up at rallies I'm excited about that and now we're allowed because we're dropping the fjb does the task include the fork no but we will we will update you as soon as the as soon as that's a thing why not look at long-term gas instead calculate the average gas needed per transaction by looking at the projected volume over time then just collect a flat fee to cover all gas needed to account for fluctuations yes so that's um what the team's working on and realistically gas is really so little um you know we're talking generally pennies um that even if we end up uh collecting something like a few dollars um that won't be an issue but this is it's just an example of you know just an example of the little details uh that cause the bugs and cause the failed transactions in the app um we do have another bug that one doesn't seem to have anything to do with gas but usually when transaction is failing it has to do with either gas or the limits and these limits are through change now or transact and limits that they uh change quite frequently in their codes um and if they were to change one of those then our code doesn't work but um yeah that's all to say these are the little it's not you know to blame the app or say the app's complete shit or you know fellow did such an awful job it's still a wonderful app that we've paid a great deal of money for um a few hundred thousand dollars at this point um so it just needs to be fine-tuned uh with these little details that make all the difference uh you know devils and the details kind of thing um so that's basically why it's not you know we're not just starting from ground zero because it truly is a great app and there has been valuable work put into it some patriot pay rallies oh yeah i'm excited for that a fork before task reveal i don't think so gas equals prudes not farts okay cow farts are great and cows are wonderful we go through like two steers three steers a year actually different question forking prior to war room launch oh i don't know i would uh very much hope for a war room launch this year still 2023 uh would be awesome i think that's still very very likely at the pace we're going but yeah i'm not sure um beef is great actually so is ketosis u.s um u.s government has a patent on ketones so more more reason for you all to get into ketosis and uh get your gki up or down they should say you know what's weird it's my browser isn't working today makes it seem like my internet isn't working but let's see if i've answered all the questions i know i've got a few on telegram today i want to make sure i got all of them who's hugo and telegram yes looks like jb already answered as of last voice chat there was no set date for third party yes correct is ketosis a drink no ketosis is when you start get into ketosis so you want to get into ketosis by basically you want your body instead of um burning carbs and glucose as its primary source of energy you want your body to start burning fat as its primary source of energy you want to do that because all your toxins are stored in fat so when you burn that fat you're also getting rid of those toxins which we are pretty much loaded with today you do that by going generally going on 70 80 fat diet so eating tons of butter and then a little bit of protein keeping it i try to keep under 20 grams of carbs a day and those are usually just carbs like carb here carb there but ketones are being well they were patented for this healing because then you also need to get plenty of sun too you will heal yourself of anything you may be going through is the team exploring the plan for a fork i.e looking at other chains besides uh buying man's smart chain yes absolutely yes some great things in the works and uh i think you all will approve most of you i don't know about universal fund he's uh takes takes a lot to impress him hurricane hugo in 1989 oh my gosh i was two years old hit north carolina coast my husband wants to move to north carolina in regards to the task is it fair to say third party have not commenced their implementation of completed work they have advised they expect to start within two weeks and then they need up to 10 days to finish yes that is correct and like i said earlier while they take these two weeks the team has decided to add on a feature that will will cut down on this time should we need to make these kind of changes in the future and we can we can go in depth on that once we're live i expect one of you is probably keeping a spreadsheet of everything we're going to uh go through once that goes live what fat cell is universal font stored in oh my goodness in regards to app is it fair to say multiple devs are viewing the code to find bugs and work on fixes correct there is no time frame for the app to be completed uh correct there's only no time frame for the app to be completed because well let me rephrase one the app will not be completed until task is complete because once task is complete there needs to be changes made in the app 100 but speaking to the bugs in the app we don't have a time frame on those because the devs literally do not know what the bugs are and everything we have tried to troubleshoot with the users having these problems we came out empty thanks for the breakdown on ketosis yeah so it's ketosis is completely different than like the keto diet those two those two are very different when most people go keto they go the keto diet where yeah that's that's a bit different than going into ketosis but yeah you should try it if you have any any health issues and then you uh refeed the carbs and you do that one or two times a week fill your cells back up with those carbs rebuild and then tear down in regards to fork is it fair to say i like these questions uh nothing happening right now but a fork is being considered in regards to a war room launch is it fair to say expected to be launched on war room in 2023 yes to both of those absolutely i will be very happy once we move chains and hopefully steve is happier about that too once we're no longer on finance oh i love carbs if you are in the east valley in arizona definitely go check out buck and rider they just opened one close to us like two miles from my house and i'm very excited that i don't have to drive an hour for it now or if you're ever in town that's where i will take you if you like seafood if you don't like seafood i don't imagine you'd like that place seafood and great drinks so that's my carb that was my carb day today in regards to entire project is it fair to say nobody more relieved that sarah when this is yeah nobody more relieved than me yeah absolutely um and i truly i truly believe that i don't think anybody on the team will be more relieved than i am and i don't think any of you with all due respect will be more relieved than i am but that's you know that comes with it that comes with territory that's because i'm i feel like i'm really kind of the only person that's on the front end and the back end kind of so you know it's all right comes with it i know it'll uh pay off when everything does come to life and i am able to share with you and everybody can finally realize this is not something i've just been um making up and that um i haven't been sitting here for so many months pretending that you know and getting off on something that i'm pretending is going on uh while steve and boris play along and the team plays along um so yes i will be i believe uh more relieved than anybody else took it this live uh but i think it will all be worth it because even those like universal fun um i think will be very very pleased with the changes once they do finally come to life and i think that comes with um i really do understand and sympathize with that because i think that does come with the changes we've made um and the the changes we've made as far as the leadership and who's really been leading the coin i think that's changed tremendously as far as doing everything we can to get these pumps um and suddenly moving to a team that generally genuinely wants the best for this coin and really wants it to to give it this highest chance of success as a real serious project uh versus just trying to pump it to get those uh tax dollars so i think that comes with the territory and that comes you know that's to be expected and that's why you know again it's your money and if you need to sell we completely respect that um and if you need to get out i mean it is your money and you're free to do that and i can honestly say uh me and the team are not one bit worried about that uh if we were we would have made time the number one priority just to get everything launched as quickly as possible which we could have very much done and made a priority the number one priority but we have not because the priority has for quite a bit now for several months been to make this a long-term project and again once you see all the changes i think you will realize that and um this is why the first video we are making after launch is geared not towards um social media not towards future holders um although those videos will come and of course we want to grow the community but the first video that is going to be completed is geared towards you the community to explain everything in every little detail and help you understand what's taken so long um to get everything worked on so i really can't wait for that thank you yeah fiat bank of america has been uh crazy here i don't know um i don't know if it's happening in other states as badly as here but one uh bank of america locations are closing here several of them and uh two they're closing yeah accounts of account holder like business account holders for crazy reasons it seems stacy says there's closed yeah we've had quite a few here we actually um i guess my my mom had like a safety deposit box and she started getting like letters every few weeks uh saying it's been closed and if she doesn't claim them i think she was overseas at the time if she doesn't come and claim them then they will be taken over by the state but yeah people are having serious issues with being debanked not be i mean we even experienced that with crypto even on transact holders here um are having issues in the u.s and out in different countries of banks not allowing you to uh spend your own money on crypto so i think that'll be probably a growing problem but uh we hope to uh find a solution i think that's all the dms i got and all the questions i got um in general chat uh let's see i was trying to open my email to give you all any updates but it's weird my discord and telegram are working but browsers are not uh yeah so anyway i'll keep you updated on oh one of you um oh i actually just got amazing news from one of our devs okay so we got great news as far as the app uh do we still have mailbox address yes yes we do we've needed to use that quite a bit for a few vendors that need a business address um okay i think that's everything um as usual please don't send any me or any other admins any money uh that's likely a scam also don't share your seed phrase with anybody no matter what kind of help you need we will never ask you for that and don't click on any weird links we will never ask you to click on strange links or to share your seed phrase if you are ever in doubt please just ask in the general chat guys i know we all have off days but um just ask in the general chat before you give away any information like that uh it's better to be safe than sorry don't want to lose your coins especially not right now uh if you need anything else always tag or dm me or email me if that's easier um what news about the app did you just get uh i will share soon but it's uh it's just regarding our error codes i think that is everything oh thank you stacy um yeah i think that's everything again i know this taken much longer than expected but um i'm not worried the team's not worried um we totally understand no pressure if you do need to sell coins it is your money um and you are free to do that we are not worried about that whatsoever if you are a holder seeing any cells i would not worry either um but everybody is free to do that and again these are all maybe somebody has a spreadsheet somewhere to remind me of all the dates um where all these mysterious tasks are being worked on within the task and after we go live i can tell you exactly which feature was added at each date um but yeah again the priority remains to make this um something long term and give us the highest chance of success versus uh just going live and again we're not you know not strong arming um these third parties that we really need much more they need us um um that's you know again we want to get things done sooner than later but the timing isn't our number one priority the negotiations we've made um that's our number one priority so fuck joe biden yes seriously the guy i can't believe he's still here to be honest i don't know if i would have guessed that i'm sure you've seen the videos though him and mitch oh my gosh wow it's nuts definitely uh term limits on that too all right well i will um update the recording and some notes i believe again feel free to email we are changing our email scene uh so that'll be changed and forwarded um or dm me and either here or telegram i always i see every pop-up that you guys uh message even though i may not always answer if it's something i'm planning to answer in here but you all have a safe night i think i'm gonna go uh walk the dogs and my husband has a hockey game so it's his first of this season hopefully this one doesn't end up in a 36 000 hospital visit we didn't play for a few years after that happened so but um no that's why uh that's why voice chat was a little bit later so sorry about that because i was not going to cook so i had to go make time to go have dinner and then come back so thank you for that i know it's a little bit late on the east coast but um yeah i'll see you all in the general chats you all have a great night
