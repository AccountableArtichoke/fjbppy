[Speaker 1]
All right, happy Friday. Sorry I'm a little delayed, having some technical difficulties on my end here. Plus I'm still trying to get through this comment.

I hope everybody's doing well. It's been a great week in FJB world. Sorry, let me turn my volume on because they're off.

So I keep hearing myself with the way it is. So I have some good news. As far as the devs go, we will know this weekend if we're going to make it by the end of the month.

So we will know by the end of the weekend. I'm kind of feeling 50-50 about it. I don't want to rush anything because I want it to get done right.

And I know every detail matters. Of course, I'm so ready to go. Our event on the 28th will go on regardless.

So that's not going to impact anything. We got the banner in, we got the merch should be in. If it's not in by that time, we have some just patriotic shirts to go ahead and go with.

Again, since the app, it hasn't been renamed yet. We're still waiting on the devs for everything to take place after that, including the LLC trademarking, all of that. So the 28th, whether we went live or not, was not going to impact that much.

So we will have the event on the 28th. Either way, again, just to kind of do a test run before we're going through with the gift cards and everything like just to get our name out. Even if our Patriot Pay merch doesn't come in, we'll still be selling patriotic and Trump shirts.

That's not a problem. I can get those from somebody local here and sell those without a different brand on them. Just kind of a generic merch like that.

So that is the banner. Thank you. So we'll have that banner up.

We'll cover the download the Patriot Pay app obviously, but again, just to do a test run or two before we go live. So that's great. Again, we'll know this weekend as far as if we're still making it in this month.

Um, app store, Apple app is back on the app store. So that's wonderful news. If anybody got a new device, I know a few of you were having troubles with that.

If you've got a new device, it's back on there for you to download again. So, uh, that's wonderful news. Uh, TPUSA, we have been approved for our press passes, uh, which is wonderful news.

Um, it kind of, it's, it's kind of nice because it does, um, kind of reinforce, uh, that rebranding was a great idea. Uh, we tried so hard with FJB coin and they just very politely, um, seemed like, you know, did not, uh, accept us or send us an invite. So, um, that's very exciting.

Uh, the next step is the application to be a vendor there, um, to be a sponsor. So I will keep you updated on that, but for the time being, we will be, uh, there at TPUSA. So that is very exciting and we'll be, um, of course, probably streaming just everything live.

So we'll, I'll keep you updated as far as that goes. Uh, so that's all the updates I have so far.

[Speaker 2]
Um, what else? Let me see if I have any questions in my inbox.

[Speaker 1]
While I look for those, by the way, please do remember to get your coins off XT. If you know anybody that has coins on XT, uh, please make sure they get their coins, um, off there. Transfer those, you will not be charged an 8%, uh, fee.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, give me just a second here.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Uh, Apple store update. Okay.

So the question, uh, right. So that's been answered already. Uh, we're back in the Apple store.

Woo. Uh, third part timeline for a task reveal.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Um, not sure what that is. So if you could clarify that, but, um, yeah, well, like I said, as this weekend goes, uh, I'll know this weekend for sure.

If we're making it by the end of the month, I'm feeling 50, 50 about it to be completely honest with you. Um, I'm not sure. Oh, third party.

What's their timeline? Uh, third party said, said from the get go that they can actually get everything done within a day, but to be sure and safe. And they want it to be within their timeline.

They wanted to give us a 10 day, they wanted 10 days, um, for them, you know, but, but they did say that this work, we can get it done in a day. We just don't want to give you guys a wrong timeline 10 days to be sure. So that hasn't changed.

They are, uh, ready to begin as soon as we are. Um, what the next seven days look like for us. Uh, goodness.

I've been busy working on the, uh, printed material. I was working on that from bed this week. Um, what is this?

Oh, events. Okay. I'll read that in a second in the chat.

Um, so, uh, continue probably wrap up all printed materials now that we're really wrapping up the reviews and not much has changed. Not really. Nothing has changed as far as, um, front end.

Uh, so wrapping up that, wrapping up all the printed material, wrapping up, uh, everything for launch and getting ready for this, uh, event on the 28th. Um, basically getting everything ordered and more of that is really, it's obviously, like I said, a test run, but also just getting, uh, everything, uh, registered and ordered for everything we need, uh, accepting payments. Obviously since people, most people aren't going to be paying in Patriot, uh, on the Patriot Pay app yet probably.

Uh, so that's nice. That's, uh, today was getting up the payment services, was ordering everything we need. Uh, yeah.

And then of course the devs had the meeting this morning with them. I want to say it was like five 30 in the morning. Um, so that went great.

But again, we will know more this weekend. We're just having a little bit trouble reaching, um, reaching, you know, previous devs we've had. So we'll see, depending on how that goes this weekend, um, it'll dictate whether our current devs, uh, need to start some things from scratch or if we will, uh, yeah, just have our previous, uh, devs help us with that.

Um, MP says, uh, he's definitely a male. All right.

[Speaker 2]
So what is it? Oh, okay. Sorry.

I think I've received a few DMs. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So is it Universal Fund's birthday or what? What are we doing all the buys for? All right.

Is TPU, sorry, I'm just now getting to the chat questions. Is, uh, TPU USA event there in December? Yes.

It'll be December 16th to the 19th. Uh, what's the status of the gift cards? The gift cards are great.

We just need the app to be working for the gift cards to work, but they have been completed for a very, very long time. Can you check out these two? Oh, hi, Fizz.

Where have you been? Can you check out these two events in Florida? I've been to them.

They have a lot of Patriots and people going in and out of the malls. Oh, cool. Yeah, I'll definitely, uh, check those out and see, let's see, December 9th and 10th.

Okay. Um, I'll definitely check them out and see how many are expected there and if they're still have any spots available for vendors. That'd be really cool.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, cool. You have the link too. Made it easier for me.

Cool. Awesome. Thank you.

Yes, I will contact them.

[Speaker 1]
We've been doing a lot of that, applying to events. Um, of course we're also working on online marketing, but as you guys know, I think all we need is, uh, more room. Shout outs really.

Just trying to get our ish together to get that done. Have second reviews started? Um, no, because we've moved things around.

We were supposed to have first review, some changes, and then second, uh, and then some changes that's been moved around.

[Speaker 2]
Um, buys to offsets. So it's not universal funds. Okay.

I forget what his, I think he started in Discord. I guess I'm going to do a few buys then to celebrate, uh, the universal. I don't know.

Did he, did he sell or is it the marketing stuff that you guys are talking about?

[Speaker 1]
Do I have a cold? No, I thought I had the flu, but I'm pretty sure it's COVID. I haven't tested, but I never get headaches ever.

And I finally started getting headaches. This morning, so pretty sure that's COVID. Uh, is first review and any required changes complete?

So yes, first review is complete and the changes are being worked on. We're just having the reviewers speak to our original devs to make sure that everything is as perfect as it can be. We don't want any unnecessary changes and we don't want any unintended changes and we want to leave all the functions, um, that the team has worked very, very hard on, um, to stay.

I drank some COVID last night. I know I haven't drank or anything. I'm like, Oh my gosh.

Oh, so universal fun will sell at 0.00022. Well, let's see. Where are we at? Oh, wow.

So that, so he's, he's selling like pretty soon. Really? Did you hear SKB almost mentioned Patriot Pan War Room today?

No way. Are you, are you joking? By the way, I'm back to finally being able to watch or listen to rather, mostly listen to, uh, War Room.

Cause I was back to walking my dogs in the mornings, but then this week I got really sick. So I think I stopped on either Tuesday or Wednesday. My husband's been walking them instead.

So I haven't watched it. So I don't think he'd sell it that price either. 45 minute mark.

Okay. So I need to watch this now. What did he say?

I need to know. I need to know. Let's see.

Where is it? 44. Is that this one?

Uh, 43 minute mark. What did he say? How come I didn't hear this?

How come you guys send me all the gossip and all the screenshots and you don't send me this. Oh, I should turn my volume on. Let's see.

I'm watching.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. You said more 45 minutes. Okay.

Let's go. Am I watching the same one?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there we go. Oh, by the way, we did contact them. So we're hoping to hear from them soon.

Oh yeah. So it's for anybody else. It's right at the 45.

He can't help it. He wanted, he wanted to say Patriot Pay. He's, you know, he's trying to contain his excitement maybe.

Awesome. Cool. I didn't, uh, nobody told me about that.

So that's really cool. But yes, uh, BNB have been, have been confirming, um, you know, the, the name and everything. I think they like it very much.

I think TPUSA likes it very much. Um, yeah, I like it very much. I know some of you don't, but you know, it's not us going woke.

We just gotta be smart. And come on, no liberal is going to want to participate with anything Patriot Pay probably. They're welcome to.

Of course, we'll, we'll accept anybody who, you know, wants to move away from all these companies that want to cancel you. We're happy to, for any of those people to use our service or our app or the coin as a payment, but we're definitely not going woke. Everybody knows we are owned by BNB.

I don't think liberals would mistake Steve Bannon or Boris for anybody who's woke. Merch is looking great. Thanks.

I got, um, so I ordered the samples before we made the big order. So far I got a hat in the mail. I got the stickers that I put all over my laptop.

So going to Starbucks will be fun. And the shirts will all be here tomorrow. I want to say like a dozen shirts maybe.

I just have to order different colors and different designs to make sure everything would, uh, come out as expected. Come on. Sorry, my little, my little old lady really wanted to come in here, I guess.

I'm all the little babies. Hi. Win merch with Patriot Pay logo.

What? They're in the, in the store right now. PatriotPay.

I think it's my Shopify. A few of them. I will post real photos if you guys want once I get them, but here I'll, I'll give you links to a few of the, actually the ones that do have logos.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see which one. Not this one.

[Speaker 1]
They all have the website on them, but the declaration one has the logo on the front.

[Speaker 2]
This one.

[Speaker 1]
We are working on getting that, uh, fixed too, because the site is weird with the way it makes you scroll. You have to scroll till the bottom of all those pictures to finally add it to your cart. And I know that's very annoying.

So I am aware of that.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see how it'll attach like. So this is, that's the back of it. And this, oops.

And this is the front of it with the logo.

[Speaker 1]
I like the logo. I want that logo on a hat, but, um, this, this printing service online doesn't do like stitches. Everything has to be printed on that patch.

So we're having somebody local do that, uh, the Patriot Pay logo on the front. Cause I think that would look really cool. I like that eagle.

[Speaker 2]
Um, what else?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I think one of you have not received, I think it was Eric and Telegram, your order. And there was some glitch that happened between Shopify and the printer. So that order I believe was shipped out today.

I did go ahead and send you that confirmation with the shipping info.

[Speaker 2]
What? Come here. Take my dog on some sake.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Neither of those are online. Neither of what's online. Thank you.

Medium rare. Uh, more of like a rare. We'll just put it in the air fryer this time.

Usually they use iron skillet, but air fryer, highest temperature, a few minutes. And I used a, I usually just do salt and pepper, but I used a coffee rub.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
What do you mean? Neither of those are online shirts with the Patriot Pay logos. The one I just posted above the link above.

So that's the back of it where it says it doesn't need to be rewritten. It needs to be reread. We the people.

And that's the front of that shirt. Or do you, do you just, you want the full logo color? Does that what you mean?

Instead of it being white? What? Come here.

You just want my sake. You can share. Is that what you want?

Is that what you want, little lady? Is that what you want, little lady?

[Speaker 2]
Are you sniffing? Okay, get down and I'll give it to you.

[Speaker 1]
Get down. I'll give you this. High five.

Good girl. All right, go there. All right.

So the, that needs to be reread is the back and the front of it is that logo. That is the same shirt. The, the writing and the flag is just on the back.

And then the logo is on the front. And then, let me see. Maybe the other one.

The other one might actually be the flag. Okay, the other one's a flag in front. So that's my mistake.

Not the logo. But I think that one would look really cool. Actually, this one has a flag on the front on the chest.

But I think that would look cool with the logo too, which we could do that. That's not a big deal at all.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, really?

[Speaker 1]
So weird because it shows that on my end and I'm not, I'm not looking at it from like, watch, I'll show you how it looks on my end. Because otherwise we're going to need to find another store. Yeah, the pit, the, the photos are very weird on there with the way they do it because they want to show you every color.

So every color that we put available, it'll include in the picture so the way it makes you scroll we're fixing that because I know that's very annoying you have to scroll through all of them to just add it to your cart I was trying to make an order and realize that super super annoying yeah I'm sure I'm sure they know we're mega that's why I assure you that nobody is going to think we're going woke by changing to Patriot pay and TPUSA is huge so call Monday okay 23rd okay it's 24th so yes Tuesday my call will be good looking forward to that we can be a sponsor there that would be well the tasks task be completed by the first I'm assuming the like a real-life event I'm not sure yet I will find out this weekend I feel 50-50 about it I'm honestly not sure it's going to depend we've done everything we can from our end but we do need something from the previous devs so we have reached out we are waiting on that if we don't get what we need our devs have to do some extra work so which will probably likely put us above or out of October so I will let you know by this weekend we will know for sure but the event will take place either way like I said even if we don't get the merch delivered by the 28th we have some backup merch from a local printer some already printed patriotic so just have a booth set up do a test run if you will get our name out there get our banner out there and printed materials looking amazing I think you guys will like that how clean everything looks definitely a huge update from before we need more merch but the logo is a focal point yes absolutely just a fine line with you know having people like our website is on everything Patriotpay.org just a fine line with having I think many people will honestly like our logo just because if you're looking for something patriotic I think you really like how clean and sleek that eagle looks versus again versus something like our old logo so you don't feel like a lot of times like that's happened to me where it's I want like a shirt right and I'm like oh that's cute but then the logo so in your face I'm like I have no association with this company you know I don't want to basically wear your huge logo so just a fine line there but yeah definitely have several options and that's I think what will be so nice about having a few in real life events even before the task is live just to again do somewhat of a test run and see what people like what people don't like just get the word out I think the printed material including the printed material for other vendors I think that'll be cool because you know you got to wonder how many of those people that are using square I mean I think most people at little markets or events like that use square and how much fees they're paying but nobody likes that so we're hoping you run over some of those vendors too oh you need some polos hey I'm down with that actually my husband like that's all he wears I don't know if he has to wear polos for work but should because that would be really cool with a little bit like that can still look pretty sleek I know I know Starbucks but to be honest Starbucks is like one of the least well coffee shops here and I don't know why that is I don't know if anybody else lives in a place like that but if you go to other coffee shops here it makes Starbucks seem mild I do make most of my coffee at home now just because it's better because I feel like I don't know if anybody else goes to Starbucks but the last few months have been really bad there's I feel like they definitely change something plus I can't get my raw heavy cream there so it's a lot better at home but their coffee's definitely gone downhill there's a new place I'm trying tomorrow morning on my way to church see who owns that one cricket milk don't get Mike in here well yuck so I so I don't know if anybody else is on Facebook I know a lot of you aren't on Facebook but I got back on Facebook because I had to have it well at the time I had to have it for my business and I'm that close now I have it for FJB whatever so I don't really use it like I don't have friends or family on there but I am in a bunch of groups and there's this Facebook group called like I don't know what it's called but basically you give the worst advice that you're supposed to give the worst advice and some guy today posted that his girlfriend wants him to go vegan he got the best advice side note I should put Mike on to that to give him the worst advice yeah yeah I can't imagine imagine if your husband or wife came in want you to be vegan oh my gosh Mike's wife wanted him to eat bugs Tucker just proved the George Floyd story was misinformation oh I can't wait to watch that nothing we didn't know same Stacey some more I did some buys I thought it was a universal fun birthday well I think that's everything I have I think that's like I know I'm hoping to hear back from some old devs again good to be back in the app store if you did get a new device you can now read download the app let me know if you have any questions or need anything as far as getting back into the app if you're re-downloading if you're re-downloading the app on a new device feel free to reach out so I could take care of you as far as that goes please make sure you get your coins off XT or if anybody you know has coins on there please get those off there I think we're we've been giving this notice for quite a while now and yeah TPUSA I think that'll be great December 16th to 19th if you are local or if you're not and you'd like to make it reach out reach out to me if you want to bring you and your wifey or something like that I think that'll be great and hopefully we also get approved to be a sponsor or vendor there I think that'd be really exciting help get our name out there again I think that's a little reinforcing that we definitely made the right decision and rebranding I think that's just the beginning I don't think you guys understand how many emails how many texts how many phone calls we sent out last year to get some press passes to this event and did not succeed so this is huge news and I think very very good news and very telling of how much we're needed in this space and how much more accepting the conservative world will be with and take us more seriously I think in general with a name like Patriot Pay versus something like FJB as fun as that was they all know and we all know still we all believe FJB so that's not an issue there but I will update you guys as oh one last thing actually one last notice if you guys have any crypto still on wire if you've not they should have sent each one of you an email if you ever did sign up with them but also get your funds out of there please they have sent us a last notice for that so I know I think most of you got your funds off there a long time ago but just making sure of that because they're about to close shop there they're going down so I heard from Boris yesterday I think it was actually I needed something from him so yeah I want to say around maybe a little bit later so yeah that's been great we are again we will take as much time as we need to to get our ish together end quote so if that does take us into the next month again I am feeling very very optimistic and again even even with the devs you know speaking to them this morning in the meeting they're like don't worry we'll get this you know we'll get this taken care of no matter what and I said oh it's fine I you know I appreciate that but I don't want you to rush either because I do want this done right it has to be done right I don't want you to skip corners or you know nothing like that so they they are very aware of that I think it's a fine line again we are so so close that I just you know it's a fine line I know it's not rushing at this point but still I'd rather not rush and get everything right so I bet his head feels bald goodness I'm sure sure he's great he's yeah I think he's on the West Coast now so he gets some Sun some of the warm weather you know so yeah yeah I think it'll be whether we make it by the end of the month or not whether we go live by the end of the month or not I I think we're still great we are moving forward by by a ton so I'm very excited for that we've got our stuff on the back end squared away as far as XT goes so that's good too it's just been a solid solid good week lots of little wins and big wins so yeah now just again gonna wrap up all the printed material wrap up the video presentation for you all to help you understand all the changes and yeah just very very much looking forward to it I think it'll be it's a good time too I feel like with all the holidays going on I don't know I think I feel I feel really good about it so yeah previous Deb do you mean fellow yes yes yes yes we have reached out to him so yeah it'll depend on that and like I said we'll know more this weekend that'll be a determining determining factor but the event will go on either way it's like more than an hour drive from my house so it'll be worth it on Saturday I think five to nine let me see five to nine or four to nine let me check for you there should be about 2,000 people there it is a very very conservative area yes 5 to 9 p.m. so I'm very excited about that hopefully the weather is cooperating I'll have my merch by then so I'll be putting that on even if we're not selling the Patriot Pay merch we'll have the banner up everything should come in the mail as far as the all the setup goes if it doesn't then I have to go buy some in person but hopefully everything comes in time the Amazon Amazon's been good to me the Amazon delivery guys I love them and leave a snack basket out for them with energy drinks and coffees and candy granola and cereal bars with a big thank you sign so I just hope they keep bringing my delivery so I don't have to go out and drive and see people but yeah it should be super exciting they'll be bounce houses bunch of kids food trucks hopefully some good food get me to go anywhere haunted hayrides petting zoo pony rides music lots of candy a bunch of vendors so it should be a really really fun crowd a bunch of really good people like I said a really cool town and there should be last year was around 2,000 people give or take so that'll be nice and not so nerve-wracking I think to a very laid-back with a bunch of just super conservative good people so I am very excited for that yeah post some live video feed oh yeah I could definitely do that yeah definitely it's planning on pictures but actually a live video would be cool I could do that even for my social media will you be allowed to put war room and B&B stuff around your tables at events to show what's being is coined yes yes the printed material although we won't be handing it out at this one because a lot of it is Patriot Pay app so we just don't want to look you know silly and go download the app you know Patriot Pay in the App Store but I think you guys will love the Patriot Pay material and Bannon will be front and center so I think I think that'll be great and like I said I think I think you all too I think we honestly owe a lot of that to you guys too I I understand when you all are frustrated that the first place some people want to go is a you know Bannon's or Boris social media or their emails however I don't think that's a good look for us and that's just my opinion completely completely 100% my opinion I just think and I think many of you would agree with that I think that's not a good look for us and does not I think I think the people who were doing that had great intentions thinking like the squeaky wheel you know kind of thing but I think that did not that did us a disservice and so I do owe a lot of B&Bs hanging on to some of you guys because of your patience and I think again this is completely my opinion for some crazy crypto psychos so I do have you all to thank for that and again I think once B&B see that we are totally capable of getting our ish together and we are totally capable of not being pieces of shit scammers that they will be more than happy to shout us out from the rooftops grow the community and you guys saw how you know what happened when we had before fire look at what happened to the wire people no but you guys saw what kind of sales came in that day as soon as we launched the app so feeling great about that and again I think everything is lining up we just have to keep going and just keep making sure that we do everything correctly rather than quickly because we're not just trying to pump and get the F out we're gonna have three black shirts no way are you really gonna dress like Steve for Halloween we need to see a awesome cool well yeah I think that's everything again we've had a great week we're looking forward to some really good weeks coming up and I will update you guys this weekend depending on how everything goes with that I will keep you updated and then we'll go from there that will determine this weekend we'll know for sure whether we're wrapping up before the end of the month or not because as of today we have eight days tick-tock unfortunately or wait third 11 days sorry I don't know why I'm thinking 20 I think I'm thinking the event in February for some reason so we'll see but yeah as of today I'll let you know as this weekend I'll for sure let you know and then we'll go from there but we have a few things to look forward to so I think that's fine does Jack have a wallet I don't know who's Jack do I know what Jack who's Jack a new user no he does not have a wallet Sam Sam's a little cutie did I tell you a few weeks ago he told me he had a girlfriend and I was like what and he goes yeah she's 13 and then he came back either the next week or the week after and she said he said that she broke up with him because he wasn't he didn't want to spend time with her he wanted to play his video games and hang out with his friends but he he felt like the best because he had a 13 year old I think he's 12 he's 11 or 12 I don't know his birthday just passed
