[Speaker 1]
So, we do actually have a few things as far as the TrustWallet, well the scam that we had happen a few weeks ago with one of our OGs regarding a scam TrustWallet browser extension. That's been taken down, so that's great. But also a TrustWallet breach that another OG holder brought to my attention, and it seems like some people were worried about it in some outside side chats.

I did bring that up with the team. They did look into it. Nobody should be impacted by that TrustWallet breach.

The only people who were impacted by it are the people who created a wallet using the browser extension between November 14th and November 23rd, so give or take 10-ish days, 9-10 days of last year, 2022. So, this should not impact you if you were not one of those people, if you did not create a wallet using the browser extension, and that's the TrustWallet. If that's the case, and this is per TrustWallet, there is nothing for you to worry about and everything's safe.

This is why the FJB education part of the app and the website I think will be very important, especially for a lot of the older crowd and the less tech-savvy, less crypto-savvy crowd. I think that'll help a ton, and that's something we're definitely looking forward to. As far as BNB, I'm sure what everybody's really looking for and the update for their approval.

As of Friday, they have one more person reviewing this, and I understand your frustration and waiting. Trust me, I am just, if not more, frustrated about it, but I think it's just important to note from their point of view, they've gotten some very not-so-happy messages in the past, whether that's getter or emails, and they just don't want to repeat that. I do want to reiterate that either way, and I don't think we should have any issue with that here.

I think everybody that we have left here, I mean, you guys are still here. You're still standing with us through everything we've been through, so again, I don't have any doubt about this, but it's like we are going to have hiccups even with the plan changes. It's not going to be perfect, so we just ask for your patience, and I understand you've given us so much of that, but again, the way I look at it is, guess what?

We're still standing here unlike most of the other altcoins, so I think that's just important to remember sometimes. Again, this is not to discount your frustration or your feelings and everything we've been through, and where we could have done better, and people that have left the team that did do wrong, etc., etc., etc., but BNB have done everything that they could as soon as it's come to their attention, so again, I think the review process just taken longer than expected because they really want to make sure that we don't get a repeat of that, if that makes sense.

So, at some point, we are going to go like, yes, of course, and that's really what it comes down to. I understand we are going so slow, but even if we are getting a little bit of improvement every day, every week, and I understand a lot of that, you're not able to see on the front end, and well, I'll get to that next step, but the important thing is we are moving forward versus moving backwards, and I think it's important to remember where we were last year. Sure, we had somebody get on and do all these pep talks, and then we find out much later that our funds were just missing, so I think it's very important to note that.

Again, we appreciate your patience and continue to ask for that even once we do get approval and move forward. It's not going to be a perfect process just with the nature of the changes happening, but it is all for the, I mean, really long-term, better for not only the community, coin, of course, chart, and ultimately new holders to come and join the community, so I think that's something definitely to keep in mind. Again, totally not discounting your frustration or how patient you have been with us, but that's really where that stems from and what's taking so long to get approval on something that's really not that insane.

It shouldn't take this long to approve, but we just want to make sure that the community is ultimately very happy, which I believe everybody will be, and we'll make sure to make sure the process does go as smoothly as possible from everything we can do on our end. And yeah, just be mindful and keep up. We'll make sure to send plenty of announcements and tags and emails to all app holders, all website subscribers, and probably put some sort of pop-up in the apps to let everybody and prepare everybody beforehand of the changes, but of course we'll hold a voice to get that all squared.

Can we get any proof of communications with everything blurred out? Okay, so I'll be honest with you. I've seen that.

Oh, what before that? Who's reviewing it now? Somebody from War Room.

What is, even though the update has nothing to do really with War Room, I want to make that clear. What does going live mean? Just a big update that we are waiting on that everything kind of builds on, and then due to the nature of the update, unfortunately we cannot disclose that yet.

Okay, so as far as can we get any proof of communication with everything blurred out, I'll be completely honest with you. I'm a little bit confused by that because when I hear that, I hear like you don't believe that I'm communicating with Bannon and Boris, and to my knowledge, everybody who has emailed Boris or Bannon and or has received an email back saying to contact me through Discord, Telegram, or the admin at fjb.org, fjbcoin.org, or Sarah at fjbcoin.org, so I am a little confused by that. If you could be honest with me, do you guys think I'm speaking to Boris and Bannon?

Has Bannon elaborated with you what Grow Community rapidly means? Yes, we spoke about that several weeks ago. I want to say after, I mean before and after really.

He shared that on War Room, and that is just the fact that him and Boris really want to grow the community rapidly, which yes, I understand the rapidly part so far, but this is why we really need to get this approval to get everything building on that. Did anyone find our money? Is anyone pursuing the culprits?

There's definitely a trail of the marketing funds. What are you thinking roughly time-wise for Greenlight from B&B, your gut feeling? You know, to be honest, I'm just probably more surprised than you are that it's taken this long, you know, especially since we were initially approved, but again, that's kind of why I want to mend that line between B&B and the community, because my feeling and understanding is really that has a lot to do with it, and if you guys have any issues, please feel free to reach out to me regarding that.

Yeah, B&B just don't want an angry mob going after them, understandably so. They want you all to be happy, so they want to make sure that this update is not going to screw anybody over, which of course we don't want to either, but this is why I am kind of reviewing with you all that, hey, you know, the coming process, and I mean really everything. Nothing is going to be perfect.

There, you know, might be hiccups that come up. That's fine. We'll get through them together, and we'll do our best to keep everybody up to date on everything we're doing as soon as we're approved and get everything going, but please be nice.

Don't email B&B with crazy stuff or, you know, tag them on Getter with crazy stuff. Yeah, and that's not blaming the community for what's taken so long to get approval either. I want to make that clear.

Just kind of being transparent with you on what is taken so long and why it's taken so long for something that's really not, that shouldn't take that long. Is Eric Finn? Leave Finn alone.

Finn's a good man. I promise. Finn's a good, very, very honest man.

So, will the LP be locked with the big reveal? Yes, yes, yes, yes. The LP will be locked as soon as we make that announcement.

That's also one of the big waits for that. Win, burn. I know.

I am. Trust me. I'm losing my mind.

Will the marketing and charity funds begin being used with the reveal? Yes, absolutely, and probably very well before that, as soon as we get approval. Finn came in with the hype and left when the hype left.

Oh, man.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Perry, I can promise you, and I would just not comment about it, you know, like other people, but I can promise you, Finn is not at fault for anything. I think if you knew, you would feel the exact same. This is not to deter you from saying what you're saying, but just being completely honest.

I promise, and that is why I, uh, I don't know. I don't want to defend, but I do truly like the man. Yeah, I do love him.

He's a great friend. Very good guy, but it was a very bad situation. Does the burn and reflection start once LP is locked, or does that get switched on later?

Um, no, that should, uh, get, that should all happen very closely together. We all stayed through that situation, thick and thin. Yes, and I, this is exactly what I have tried, um, to reiterate to B&B, um, that truly the community we have left now, um, I don't think anything can kill us.

I'll be honest with you. Um, and so just trying to reassure B&B, although, you know, no situation is perfect and there is just textbook wise, this is not just saying like, yeah, cause FJB can never get timelines or, you know, X, Y, Z, textbook wise of, you know, our coming updates, there are going to be hiccups. That's just the way it happens.

Um, and trying to get B&B to understand that the, everybody here and the majority of the community here now is going to get through that with us. And of course, again, we'll do our best to make sure that you all are aware of everything. So you don't, you know, somehow, I don't know, get, you know, screwed over by anything, et cetera, et cetera.

Um, yeah, I'll just stop there. So I don't want to say too much, but, uh, yes, we all are still here through everything we've been through, still standing, um, which is a lot more than, uh, we can say about most all coins. I don't know what happened to the let's go Brandon one.

[Speaker 2]
They still have their chats up.

[Speaker 1]
Can we get a tax-free weekend starting Friday? We really need to lower the tax by a lot. It's deliberating.

Um, so the tap, the plan for the taxes are to eventually be lowered, um, with the plans, um, with the upcoming plans and the upcoming marketing. It's, I mean, we need that money for marketing guys for actual marketing. Um, and we need that to get more holders in.

Uh, but yes, that is definitely the plan. Um, even through like, you know, the app and always remember you can still buy a completely tax-free through L bank. Uh, I know not a lot of people use XT.

I think a lot more use L bank. So I know I've seen some conversation about it in here this week about the tax. Um, you can always, uh, buy through L bank.

Yeah. I think as, um, time goes on and we start growing, the 8% can definitely be lowered with volume. I hope that makes sense.

Pretty, pretty simple. The more volume we get, the more, uh, we can decrease the tax. Can't you also say the 8% keeps us from growing, start marketing and the volume will come.

There I fixed it.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. I know. I know.

Trust me. I agree with you on, uh, most everything. Not everything.

[Speaker 1]
Is the team thinking about how to keep big holders from selling once we launch because we are not staking any plans? Um, no, we will not be locking, um, wallets to keep big holders from growing. I know we are not doing staking, but we are, the plan, uh, is to do reflections.

And I hope it, I would hope at this point, um, I would say probably at least most of the big holders know better than to just tank the charts. Um, I think most would agree with that. I think everybody here genuinely, um, takes, I don't know, is thinking of this coin more than just a dollar at this point.

And I think most people here genuinely care about the community and the coin that they're not going to just dump their wallet at once. Of course. Yeah.

Taking profits. That's, uh, that's a part of it, obviously. Um, but yes.

Staking is target for the SANK. That's why reflections. Yeah.

Yep. Absolutely. When will FJB sell some coins on the exchanges to provide liquidity?

Um, I'm not sure about that.

[Speaker 2]
We will save that, though. Excuse me.

[Speaker 1]
BNB is looking nice.

[Speaker 2]
2338. Nice. BNB get, can get back to the 5600s.

We're golden. It's the last year around this time. It was, what, above four?

404.

[Speaker 1]
When will FJB do a promotion with the exchanges? Um, right now, and I think everybody will understand once we get closer, but, um, right now we are not doing any marketing until we get these changes approved. Because it will just, uh, make it a lot more difficult.

And, uh, so before going with that, um, before we, when we had the approval for the changes before, uh, you know, we were told to actually plump the grapes again, um, we were going to wait for the, to work on the app just because it would be really, ideally be better. Um, but with it taking as long, um, we will be starting those changes, um, shortly. We'll update you on the timeline, um, if approval stretches out a bit longer.

That way, um, we're at least working on something that you all can see. Uh, Boris Klosiet, he is having somebody from War Room review the changes. That's as of this last Friday.

I know. What the heck? Yesterday was a crazy day.

Oh my gosh. Where's Tucker going to end up? I wonder if he's going to end up with James O'Keefe.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
War Room? Oh, man. The strategic advisor for FGDI, I saw that.

We're going to need a little bit more marketing funds for him, I think, to afford him. Well, yeah, he is the marketing, but, you know, to pay for him, to afford him. Maybe we'll ask Bannon for a loan.

Is this the biggest update the team has taken on? Um, it, it will be, um, as far as the updates that build on it, and because of all the updates that come with it. He's already a millionaire, doesn't need cash.

Is that how it works? Millionaires don't need more money. We sound close.

Am I wrong? Um, I mean, I don't think so, just because we're a week closer, um, and I, I think B&B can only have so many people review it, but, you know, like, like I was kind of getting the community, trying to bridge that gap between the community and B&B, because I understand where they're coming from, and of course I understand where you all are coming from, um, but just to have everybody understand that, you know, if there are hiccups, if there's anything like that, um, that, you know, I'm sure will be, uh, it's not going to be the end of the world. It's not going to be detrimental by any means, but that we do ask for your patience, um, and keep in mind that this is, uh, going to be best for, really, everyone involved in the long run, um, and what I mean by that, basically, I just feel like, and others may feel like, if something, you know, hiccup happens, that's, again, completely expected with these changes, that people will come on and say, oh my gosh, you guys can't do anything wrong, or anything right, of course, this is FJB, blah, blah, blah, um, so kind of just, just getting everybody ready for that. I understand it's unfortunate coming in after, uh, some very unfortunate events happened, um, but yeah, ultimately, this will be very good, um, just, we continue asking for your patience and appreciating your patience, um, again, I don't think we'll have a problem with that with everybody that we do have

[Speaker 2]
left, to be honest, uh, sorry, I'm trying to get all the way up, uh, rest in peace, Fox, yeah,

[Speaker 1]
not that I ever watched them, but yeah, I did watch Tucker sometimes, what future ideas didn't make the cut for this update, uh, I'd have to check my list there, but there are quite a few, or some, like, you know, um, like, reflections made it versus the staking that was originally on there. Oh, B&B's still planning on doing a bank or a credit card with FJB, that would be amazing, just gotta start small, you know, had a dream I was worth 63 million, let's go half a buck, won't give up, uh, we don't care about hiccups as long as we're moving, yeah, I totally agree, and, um, you know, it's, I understand the frustration of, uh, how slowly we've been moving, but, uh, we are moving forward, and I think, uh, really that's what matters when, again, a lot of alt coins haven't survived, and, uh, I think we're doing a lot better than we were last year around this time, even, um, you know, we had a bunch of hype, but we had the, uh, marketing wallet going somewhere, you know, where we were told where it was going, but, uh, never saw that, never saw the marketing, um, from that marketing money, um, so I think those are all positives. We're actually moving backwards because inflation, yeah, it's, you know, inflation's a B, but, uh, I think BNB's going up, and we'll get back up too.

Yep, exactly, so, um, Wolverine said, can we get some devs to fix the app while we wait, um, so the plan, uh, what I was saying earlier is the plan was to get approval for everything before we started on that, um, since this is taking longer than expected, um, we will have devs begin on these changes, uh, we just need to be careful of the changes that are made, um, basically to make sure that once we are approved for the bigger changes, uh, the devs aren't going to have to go back in and redo all that work, if that makes sense, but yes, that is, uh, the plan, and I will get you a timeline, but that should be very, very close, uh, in the devs, uh, ball court. Sarah, when can we expect to see some visual changes?

Um, so, that will, I'm assuming with the app, um, that will be very soon. I will update you as soon as we have a time, although timelines, well, especially when I'm depending on somebody else. Uh, are gift cards still in the plans?

Yes, gift cards are pretty much a hundred percent complete, um, yeah, however, with every, with the changes we have approved, um, yeah, well, but yeah, gift cards are complete, like, if you want a gift card right now, I can get you a gift card. The reason we are not marketing them, um, are because we are waiting on that approval. I mean, changes that are going on in the background that we can see progress.

Uh, what was the original? When can we expect to see some visual changes? Um, yeah, I mean, even, even with that, I think, um, some of the approved changes, um, which is not the bigger, not the bigger, uh, announcement we were waiting for, um, we will get the devs started on.

Can they offer a small percentage of the purchase price, like one percent or two percent to retailers for carrying FJB gift cards in their stores? Yes, absolutely. Yes, um, that is on the agenda.

Um, there are some downsides to the way that works, like everything else, um, but yes, definitely. This is crypto. I don't see any rules.

No need for approval. The show goes on. Okay, we'll just go completely rogue.

Any proof of comms with Boris and, um, Bannon or Boris, uh, Universal is asking. So, I think Tim already asked that. Um, with, um, Bannon and Boris, I think everybody that's emailed them has been told to contact me through telegram, discord, or the emails.

So, um, I don't know if that's what you're getting at. If it's not, please clarify that, like, I'm making up my communication with, uh, Bannon or Boris, but, uh, yeah. I, uh, promise I am not making it up, although I guess even that is you taking my word for it.

[Speaker 2]
I emailed Boris twice.

[Speaker 1]
Um, yeah, I understand he is, uh, very busy, and I'm sorry if he has not gotten back to you. Can it be proven, though? Can what be proven?

My communication with Bannon and Boris? I mean, you can email them. I'm not allowed to share screenshots from them.

I'm sorry. I don't know how else to... I mean, I guess if they left me with all the keys and passwords and just kind of walked away, or...

I'm sorry. I do hope to get them on here to, um, speak to you all, and hopefully that... I don't know.

I hope... hopefully that helps. I'm not sure what else to do.

I'm sorry. Finman used to tease screenshots of text threads with them, and they used to come on, but haven't in many months. Yes, um, I understand.

I understand that's why there's doubts. Um, I'm right there with you. We have...

I have spoken to Bannon and Boris many times about coming on here. Um, they do want to get these updates started, um, before scheduling that, and this was as recent as, um, I want to say a few weeks ago since we last discussed that. And again, I understand not trusting me, um, after what we've had old management do, but I...

I honestly don't know what else to, uh, I don't know. I don't know what else to tell you. I think...

I'm sure people can share screenshots with you that they have, uh, received from B&B on where to or who to contact regarding anything FJB related.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, um, was this answered?

[Speaker 1]
Is the team thinking about how to keep big holders from selling, um, once we launch because we are not staking? Yes. Um, yes, we will not be locking wallets like, um, old management did in the past.

Um, that won't be happening again, and I know we're not doing staking. The plan is to do reflections. Um, we do hope that the big holders holding on now are not going to take the charts.

May have missed it earlier. Is the roadmap going to be amended to reflect accuracy see recording quarter one, quarter two accuracy, et cetera, uh, soon as we do get approval? Yes.

Um, please keep in mind when that was made, um, we had everything, uh, approved. So progress behind the scenes as more is being added across the management team. Team, uh, yeah, we've had quite a few people, five, six, seven, eight, nine, uh, probably a dozen people now reviewed this.

[Speaker 2]
Do B&B own the FJB smart contract? Uh, yes, I believe so. Um, what was I also just going to say?

[Speaker 1]
Do you think they will need another few months? Oh, gosh, no. Um, God, I really, um, really, really hope not.

No. Um, yeah, a few months would be uh, awfully long for an update like this. Um, I do want to, before I go, uh, reiterate again, the trust wallet, um, browser extension that one of our OGs got scammed of that has been removed.

Um, and then also regarding the trust wallet breaches that I was told a few inside chats have been, um, concerned about and wanting to move their coins. Um, we had the team look into it. And, um, again, unless you made an account using the trust wallet browser extension between November, uh, about nine days in November of last year, you should not be impacted by this trust wallet breach.

Um, so pretty rare that I'm not sure if any of our holders fall in there, um, or been impacted by that, but just want to reiterate that. Um, yeah. Uh, when LP locks, will we still be on B&B?

Uh, yes, I believe so. Okay. Uh, I think that is everything.

Let me know, uh, if you do have any, uh, change now transactions, get stuck, um, in processing. Uh, also if you have any issues with the transact, uh, we haven't had anybody in this, I think in about a week and a half, uh, have any issues that I have seen or, uh, received any DMs for. Um, so we'll keep you updated on that.

Um, the next voice chat is planned for Friday, but, um, we might have one before that. Um, I will keep you updated if we do. Uh, as always let me know if you have any questions.

Um, I know I've not been very active in the chats, but that's just because I've just, you know, kind of let everybody vent. Um, I understand you're frustrated. I promise I do.

Um, but I am here. Uh, yeah, if you need anything. So I hope you all have a wonderful night.

I will post this recording right now. Um, let me know if there's anything else I can help with. All right.

Thank you. I'll talk to you soon.
