Security fix the dev is working on something they're familiar with. Yes, it's um So the security fix is definitely not to scare anybody. It's just our Signing Feature how how the smart wallet signs your transactions so currently The way it works is through Vess. 

So we just need to Change that function because magic Has made some changes recently We can't just have it work the way it was working Everything that the that function basically asks for Almost for lack of better terms all the way almost the way That when you go and enter your pin when you try a transaction through the app The info it asks for and basically how The auth service which is you know was best and you and the app how you all communicate It's actually good because it will even be more secure in case your device gets hacked somehow Well, we have a Patriot patent a TPS a possibly if we're good by then Well, definitely we have the We have somebody working on our video for socials and marketing on our first main video and we'll definitely be paying to adverse advertise that Campuses Once we have that ready, so it's very excited about that Does the dev think the security fix will be done this week I'm I was supposed to get an estimate a few days ago I'm told I'm supposed to get a better estimate tonight or tomorrow morning I will update you guys if I do be an estimate, but as you know with With Estimates how those go And again, my number one priority is getting it done, right Steve needs it done, right? Did Farkas or Nolan ever find the end reveal the hidden info alluded to no nobody has Which I'm actually very surprised by Whoever I first spoke to about it was like nobody's gonna figure that out. I was like, no I think we'll have guys that'll figure that out like I Have to find what like my bet was I Want to say it was like a week tops. I Was wrong Using magic pain master for gas with transactions. 

No We are not if smart wallet was gonna be a pain a Bigger pain to work with we're gonna switch to that, but we really want to stay as self-sufficient as possible Even when we have the option to do so What what's on our list also? is how So right now we use change now For all of our swaps in the app We'll be adding simple swap It's a little bit It's a little bit lower on the list. It's not definitely not the highest priority But it's definitely on the list that way in case change now, you know They experience issues and bugs and stuff which hasn't impacted us Tremendously With our volume But that could really impact us if and when volume picks up So it'll be nice to have change now and simple swap doing that. We have everything from simple swap ready to go We'll also add Both of those widgets Almost done with the website edits here Dog bone to go ahead and change for us, which should be really exciting and just geared a little bit more towards the boomers or Crypto novices who will get on our website and really have no idea where we are Just to make it easier to find that information. 

I Think that's one of my biggest pet peeves is like getting on a site and I've run into that recently actually through like the conventions It's frustrating to get on a website and just be like, yeah, but what are you like, I Really don't even know what you are and nowhere on the website. Can I find what the heck you do? It's wild so Definitely want to make not saying our website is that bad by any means but just want to make it easier for people to get on Super obvious and easy for anybody jumping on the website to see what the heck we are Without having to you know, read the white paper To figure it out Nespresso shot and I Didn't put any heavy cream on here like I usually do just put a ton of butter and I'm not sure if I'm a fan I think that's gonna take a lot of getting used to It's nice though when you're in a huge hurry because I don't want to take the thing out of the cream now Where's the white paper posted looks like Stacy answered that for you. Hi Linda Linda every time I see your picture pop up. 

You're so pretty Every time I see that I'm like, oh my gosh, she's so pretty just have to say that All the guys are going to check your picture out right now, I'm sure Do you think there will be testing of magic link prior to the end of I Honestly would be lying if I gave you any timeline We did just get this new dev on So I'm not familiar with him yet, I am very very excited For him to get on though Super exciting closer to my time zone Which is amazing His schedules very close to mine wakes up early goes to bed early Although I've been going to bed super late trying to work on everything But I will update you guys as soon as I have an update Is the secret in the PPI v2 contract or no, it should be in the main contract It's just a little it's not it's not like a function or anything just an Easter egg that I'm surprised Nobody's caught The rest of the work your dev is now working on what is it? Does this work need to be completed prior to marketing? I'm curious if You're talking about the second dev I just discussed at the beginning of the call the second dev has moved on to his Specifically what he's been working on today is changes in the smart contract And yes, it will need to be completed prior to marketing, but it shouldn't This isn't gonna take this isn't something that's gonna take a week or two. It's just changing the team working on the team funds function Right now we have The balance we can either put it on auto sell and if we put on manual sell when we go to sell we have to sell the whole team wallet and it disperses it between you know, the LP and charity and community and marketing Or operations, I think we call it now, but We're changing the function so that one we can keep some PPI And actually use it so we don't have to you know, sell everything when we go manual and To Well, I guess yeah kind of two functions so one keep some PPI and to not Sell everything at once make partial cells So that Like an incidence right now, I think Farkas posted the balances above and you can So that when we have a larger balance we don't have to make a huge sell it's not at all or nothing with The Team cells Doesn't need to wreck the chart What's the new dev doing for the project the new dev is working on the security issue Upgrading Security points with the Transaction signing process that we have in place since we're switching from this to the new company Some changes need to be made there what the changes that the new company made Which is also great because this company has a lot of features They're adding in the next even just in the rest of the year. It should be super exciting We'll be really fun them evolving and then Us evolving alongside Do you think there will be marketing and an introduction of all influencers and partners prior to the end of May May give us a month. 

So I sure hope so. That'll be a long time for To have magic But of course If anything comes up, then we will make sure it's functioning 100% and I think having Yeah, I think I think we'll be Happy with our dev team right now I'll try to get everything done As soon as they can but Priority is getting everything done Correctly If Any of our Partners make any changes we have to make changes Everything works Like it's intended to but I think we're very close to having at least making the switch from this Over so that will be a huge relief in the meantime, please don't Forget try to think of anybody you've ever asked To download the app because they could have some FGB. So in the meantime while we wait I think we've gotten plenty more time than we thought we would for anybody to move their funds off. 

So There should be no excuse at this point Emails recently You know the burn be completed same answer I've given you guys all before I mean As soon as we pay everybody out so that will be that'll be a while But it's not gonna have really any impact on Your price or your coins or the charts Got There's 47 There's one to another contest There's some burns for you and he Too bad, I can't put looks like Gosh, you guys have Stacy. Holy smokes 103. Okay, let's enter it into Wait, what was that one of three? Yeah, one two one and one or three generate 46 Oh, holy smokes Obviously number 46, but whoever had apparently 55 entries I'm gonna be typing this in here Which one of you just won so whoever that is Then we can do a new contest I feel like we should do a different one Something else I think we should have a different entry And that's the last burn and then Feel like we should do a different contest, but it's hard when our app isn't ready.

For a marketplace In the Patriot pay app before Friday voice-chat time Whoever can do that We'll do the same prize Which is what we've been doing 500k, right?
