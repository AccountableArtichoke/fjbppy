[Speaker 1]
Cool, happy Friday. I just wanted to get on here and give you a rundown of where we're at, everything going on behind the scenes. You guys know one of the guys, major, major guy was out for the main third party we need to wrap everything up.

I think he was out for two days. He is back. We are waiting for them to send the legal paperwork and then they'll start wrapping that up and we as soon as they complete that we'll be going live.

Yeah, we'll go within minutes of them completing that so we'll coordinate that. I'll keep you all updated on the progress of that. Everything else, gosh, has just been a bunch of administrative stuff.

I'm sure you can see our website. I'll put that on here. That's construction started on that so really excited for that.

Also, I've started everything with our vendors so if you own a business and doesn't need to be in the U.S., could be anywhere, and are interested in accepting Patriot Pay or using that as a payment processor, go ahead and contact me. We haven't 100% completed a promotion but we have a promotion. I'll keep you updated as soon as we've wrapped that up and you'll get an awesome, awesome deal.

We haven't decided whether to do that for like the first five, the first ten, but we'll make it a really, really cool promotion for the very first businesses, very first few that start accepting Patriot Pay and using us as essentially a payment processor. We're waiting on legal for all the verbiage we can legally use for all that so we'll keep you updated on that. But yeah, it's just been a bunch of administrative stuff.

Likely to be live by this time next week, September 1st. Our third party says they can have everything done. He says technically they can have it done in a week but he doesn't want to promise us that by the end of the month.

He is thinking 10 days would be for sure. So I will keep you updated. Again, that can change.

That's completely out of our hands. We are really just so, so grateful they are taking this chance on us and we are very grateful with the negotiations they've made as of, what was it? I believe yesterday.

All my dates are mixed up because I just get up in all hours of the night. But we are very happy about that and the rates they've given us negotiated even further. Our savings will be able to pass on to you so that's also great news.

We are very, very grateful for them working with us and wanting to grow with us so we'll keep you updated on that. With Patriot Pay being some kind of payment processor, how does FJB integrate? So as I feel like now I'm giving you too much.

As a business who uses or wants to use Patriot Pay as a payment processor, they will be accepting FJB. That's all I could say about that now but as soon as we're live we'll have more details on that along with the political donations. Very excited.

A lot more details, a lot more really cool functions but I will update you on that as we go live. For now though if you are, if you do have a business, and it could be a really small business. I know, actually, I wonder if, I know Lauren does a lot of the kind of like MLM stuff.

I wonder if even, you know, even if you have something, I don't know, you sell your raw milk on your farm. You know, it doesn't, we can go ahead and do that. So contact me if you're interested.

I think we'll do an awesome, awesome, super awesome promotion for the first few and then take it from there. If you are interested just go ahead and shoot me a DM or email us and we'll go there. Let's see, the website, domains, let's see, really has just been a bunch of super boring stuff.

The third party said they're, they should have that legal document to us for signage on Monday, which is our Sunday. So very looking forward to that. We'll sign it as soon as we receive it.

We've already, like I said, negotiated down the rates and they've actually given us a better deal than we even asked for. So super excited for that. Very, very grateful.

Everything else has been pretty boring, legal, websites, graphics. I'm super, super excited for you guys to see the new website. It'll be super clean.

And yeah, just working with all kinds of third parties that I'm very excited to share with you all. Guys, oh, can't hear. Shoot, I'm sorry.

I am, now let me check. I am recording so I'll post it in case you're not able to catch it. Sorry about that.

I don't know why. What was I about to say though? Was, oh, okay, going back to the smart wallet.

Guys, the smart wallet hasn't worked for quite a long time. Again, the dev, the first thing to do on his to-do list is to work out those bugs to get your transactions going, threatening us with the Feds or Google Play Store or Apple Play Store. You guys can go ahead and do that.

What they're going to do is shut down the app and then your money is really going to be stuck. Just bear with us. I'm not sure at this point why anybody would still be trying to sabotage us.

I feel like we've died a dozen times over. You know, nobody's forcing you to be here. Just your funds are still in your own custody.

We can't access them. Again, if you're choosing to buy on the smart wallet when we've told you for months and months and months, this smart wallet is not operating as it should. Just try not to be a piece of shit, okay?

Like, there's a lot of people working on this. We're really, really excited for everything that we know you all will be too. Just, please, just try to be a half-decent person.

Have any vendors... so, we're actually opening this up to community members first. And then we'll go from there.

So, to answer your question, no. Because we are giving you all a chance at that first. Also going to be, I know somebody, I think it was Telegram, concerned about merch, but the reason actually we're starting on that this weekend is to make sure that's all ready for in-person events because that all kind of takes a while.

I don't think we've had any other issues with that. We will. Again, just a reminder, and I'll make sure I will post again something about it for you all, but don't listen to the voice chats.

Please get your coins off XT. Do that sooner than later. If you're unable to, or if you have any issues, please go ahead and DM or email me and we'll get you all taken care of.

Make sure to get your coins off there, please. Also, I don't think I have any questions. I don't think I have any questions in DMs. Yep, website is under construction. So, let's see. What else? I was going to go on to something else before I went to XT, but the DMs are always a distraction.

It's like my mind can't. Okay, cool. I'm already receiving a few of you interested for Patreon pay.

FJB is the front and center of the payment process. Yes, that's so as a vendor, that's what you'll be accepting as payment. However, the features are amazing and we'll talk more about that once we're live.

It'd be super cool and it'll be awesome for everybody involved and give businesses a reason to want to use us. But yes, definitely FJB. As the currency, super excited about that and super excited about the political donations too, especially with how Trump is doing.

I don't have the numbers on that and I don't really trust any numbers out there, but I think he's done pretty well this week especially. So, I'm very excited for that. I'm sure Boris is very happy about that too.

How's the new blockchain advisor looking? Absolutely amazing. Super cool.

I think we have the best team ever. Very, very excited for that and I'm so excited for you guys to finally, gosh, see everything we've been working on. Yeah, I think it'll be cool and worth it.

I think even the dev said something yesterday like, I think a few people were upset in general chat. He said, oh, not good in there. When do we go live?

So, he's excited for that too. But yeah, I think that's all. If you all need anything else, as always, feel free to tag me or DM.

I don't think we've had any major issues. Anything else? The gift cards, lots of more administrative stuff.

Those are getting rebranded, obviously. Next voice chat on Tuesday or possibly early? Yeah, probably Tuesday.

I'll let you guys know as soon as we receive the legal paperwork from the third party and as soon as we have that going. I will keep you updated. Oh, that's what I was going to say about XT.

I will keep you updated on everything. And just remember, there's nothing that you actually need to do. We just need you all to do nothing.

That's actually what specifically what we need you to do. Just don't mess with anything. Don't do anything while we go live.

The minute it goes live, will you schedule a last minute voice chat? Yes, absolutely. Yes, I will be very excited to do that.

Very excited. And as soon as it is kind of nice that the third party is needing actually like 10 days, as he said, because if you remember, I told you before that we'll start working on the final details of the white paper once we actually are live, because we've had so many changes with the details. But we can't make any changes once we've pushed everything through to them, to the third party, which will be as soon as they send over that paperwork for us to sign.

So that gives us 10 days there. And then they said they will very well probably be done before that. But you've all known it's like the FJB curse.

So you know, I'm not holding my breath for that. I'm thinking at least 10 days. But what will be nice is that gives us time with all those details completed and everything finalized to get the details in the white paper all finalized too.

So that would be really nice if they do it. And if they complete it as planned, because then that means the white paper will come out as soon as we're live, which would be absolutely fabulous. Very excited about that.

Do you know anything about this? Yes, our website is under construction. Yes, yes, yes.

Very excited. I told you guys before we go live a few weeks are going to be crazy busy because it's kind of like we just had to everything everything has to be pushed at once. So you'll start seeing everything on the front end, which is awesome.

With the vendors too, if you know any vendors or small businesses, I mean, they don't have to be small businesses. But you know, the larger businesses we're kind of all aware of. Feel free to send them over to me too.

If it's a business you love and think would be interested in Patriot Pay, go ahead and send me that too. I don't know if Sandy is still a holder. I know back then she said she wanted to accept FJB for her.

I think it was like eggs and milk possibly. So let me know. Buying won't be interrupted at going live.

We will, so everything is depending on so many factors and quite a few third parties. We will make sure that you all can buy when we go live. We're trying to have, we're trying to get the dev to work on the app while he can.

But again, the way everything is set up, it'll be a very interesting few weeks. But at this point, I personally am thinking we're definitely definitely 100% going if we get the paperwork on Sunday, their Monday, get that signed over and they start they said it they said 10 days tops. But again, to be completely honest with you guys, I'm thinking okay, well, if somebody's sick again, or what have you, so I'm thinking okay, maybe it'll be over 10 days, even though they said it's actually one days of work, but give them 10 days to make sure then I'm thinking will for sure be a solid solid launch in September.

But again, we're at this point, we're completely done with everything. And everything is third party at this point. So I will keep you all updated, but I'm feeling very good and getting myself prepped for definitely this month.

Again, that changes that will keep you updated as soon as I find out I promise we are we are very grateful for the negotiations they've made with us. So they'll, they actually said, Oh, I was gonna tell you all this, they actually said, they really feel so great about everything we're doing that they are willing to give us back a percentage of their fee. This is on top of the negotiated fees that I'll tell you more about once we go live.

But this is completely separate from that they said they're actually willing to put a portion of their feeds towards marketing for us. So that's very, very exciting. And I think they definitely believe in everything we're doing, which is great news.

It's definitely encouraging. Okay, that's everything. Oh, there's money.

Lemon drop. Okay, I think that's everything we we might need to actually start a another Patriot pay discord. I'll keep you updated on that.

And then we might need to start a different telegram channel only because of the way we like it set up. So I'm sorry to have to do that and have you join one more but I will keep you updated on that. We will be done with this maybe maybe some of the FJB curse will go with the old servers too on channels.

Okay, I think that wraps up everything. Again, please feel free to DM me if you are interested in using Patriot pay for accepting payments for your business or if you know any business that would be interested and we could reach out to them. Especially again, this goes super convenient for things like small farms or gun shops.

Yeah, super excited for that. I will keep you all updated again. If I do get updates before Tuesday, I will update in a text announcement like I did last night.

But I'm here if you have any questions again, tag me or DM me. Again, don't share your seed phrase with anybody. Again, use a smart wallet at your own risk.

I do not recommend using that right now. For those that are still using it or trying to get funds out. Again, if it's Ethereum, you probably just need quite a bit more gas.

But I do not recommend using that right now. I'll keep you updated on the devs progress with that. Currently, he's actually working on he's working on coding something for one of our partners.

So very excited about that and should be done midweek. I've also updated our partners on it. So that's really cool.

Okay. All right. Thank you all so much.

I hope you have a wonderful night. Have a great and safe weekend. I will be here actually working most of the weekend.

So let me know if you need anything. I will post a recording with a few notes. Yes.

If you missed it, no worries. Yeah. That's all.

Super, super excited to get this wrapped up. The excitement is like finally coming. Talk to you guys later.

Bye.
