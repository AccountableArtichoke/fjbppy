[Speaker 1]
You've got to pump it up Everybody woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Let's start the fun.

I'm like, all right, that's fine It's gonna happen. You know what I mean? Like the FUD happens that neither here nor there mother Jones tried to stir up a little coup They try to stir up a little crowd They got a I'm gonna address that first.

That's that's primarily the reason why I wanted to come up here Mother Jones released an article. I'm sure you guys have all seen about be like basically be weary of Steve Bannon's crypto coin blah blah blah they called me out and they said that I Declined to comment. They did not reach out to me at all, by the way So they didn't reach out to me and they said that I declined to comment.

So sounds like a Liberal to me, but um, so just it's it was a lie. There was a lot of things that were that were Not true. They were not true in the article and we did release a rebuttal We we sent it to them.

They should be correcting that shortly I think they'll be hilarious that they do come out and they say hey We messed up. We have to change the missing because they Obviously we knew that mother Jones was coming. We knew about a week ago that it was coming We didn't know when it was gonna come what I was gonna say however They do not like Steve Bannon.

They do not like Boris. So it's it's a bunch of nobodies. It's it's a low-end Liberal left-wing media outlet that is itching for a story.

They're itching to get to something It's it is what it is when you're successful People come at you. That's what happens. I am I couldn't be less worried.

I don't care if they slander me I don't I'll take I don't care. You know what I mean? Like I'll take it because they don't know what they're talking about They don't know and maybe if they have people in the discord here right now, you know what?

Thank you for giving us free publicity. Any publicity is good publicity There are a bunch of idiots. So if you're in here, you're an idiot if you're from mother Jones, I don't care I couldn't care less.

I know some people got scared. I think that that's what they wanted to do. They wanted to Get us all crazy.

They wanted to make us like a mutiny whatever. It's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen They can't stop this train.

Nobody can stop the train I knew that this was going to happen when I first started the coin I was like, I know that liberal media outlets are gonna cover it I'm still waiting for the day that and I'm that I see CNN talking about us because I will I will I will think that Is the funniest thing? Because they're idiots. That's like that's just what happened.

They don't understand what we're building. They don't understand how Great this community is and I just wanted to come in here tonight to address that Say that like they don't know the two people that we have. They don't know how much fun we have They don't know how caring how like our donations like they don't know anything about us So they can screw off because honestly, they don't all they are trying to do is slander us and what they were saying Was just not true.

They were they spread a lot of false hope to People that are trying to slander the coin and whatever what they got their 15 minutes of fame You probably can't even that that or that news article is gonna be so buried in the weeds in about a week On the news pages can be on the second page of Google. So that's where that's where it's gonna be I'm excited for that because you never if you get on the second page of Google you're lost So I don't care. We should nobody here should care and show losers enough on that topic The rebuttal is gonna come in.

It's gonna be great All right, following up from that the NFT drop was supposed to be exclusive to the FTP holders today Due to technical difficulties as you guys have seen with this coin if you've been in here since the beginning or if you've been in any project timelines are very hard in this world because you have to wait for codes to work you have to wait for your Internet the online is always so many things that I don't even know about I go into this stuff Like especially on like OpenSea or whatever it's going on the Ethereum Network There's just you have to basically have all of the stars to align so I can officially say that it's postponed to Saturday The exclusive release is going to be Saturday so you can quote me on that.
