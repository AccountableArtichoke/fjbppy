Awesome. Happy Friday. Hope everybody's doing well.

I have some updates, nothing super major, but a few updates here. The review is still going very well. They are actually on track to be done with that first review very, very soon.

So I will keep you updated on the progress of that. Again, once that first review is completed, we'll go ahead and have the second review that'll start right away, and then any changes that need to be made will be made, and then the third party will begin. So that's still going very, very well, again, and better than expected as late as, actually, I think yesterday.

Is that yesterday? All my days are just blending together. So as of, it may have been this morning.

Anyway, going better than expected, and actually quicker than expected. So that's great news. As far as the merch, we're still waiting on that.

However, we've gotten approved for three events so far. That's great news. I will keep you updated on those.

So the next step is just, now I'm just making sure the other vendors that are there have been happy, so we're just not wasting a ton of money. But either way, it'll be really as long as we're getting our name out there. That's great news.

What else? Do I know the Muffin Man? No, I do not.

I've been having a lot of muffins lately on my cheat day. They're more like cupcakes, but they're these gluten-free muffins from Trader Joe's. They're really good, especially if you're celiac.

Even if you're not, I don't think you'd be able to tell they're gluten-free. What else? The app is still being worked on.

As far as the failed transactions, those have not been solved yet. But I will keep you updated as soon as that's completed. Definitely looking forward to that.

So the few of you that have funds stuck in there can get that transferred off. If you do have funds in XT or on XT in your XT wallet, please transfer those out ASAP. You will not be charged the 8% tax.

I believe it's around 8,000 coins you get charged to transfer those. Go ahead and transfer those to a trust wallet or a MetaMask wallet ASAP. Please, if you need any help with that, feel free to reach out, email, DM, or tag me so we can get you taken care of.

What else? Any questions? Sorry, I'm not trying to make drinking noises, but it's time for coffee.

I don't think I got any questions in DMs this week. And in my emails either.

[Speaker 2]
That got you to level 23, you're welcome, J-Rock.

[Speaker 1]
I am this coffee with, it's an iced coffee actually, like an iced, a few shots of espresso with some raw cream, and then these cinnamon gummies. Gummies. Quite the combo.

[Speaker 2]
I haven't talked for a while.

[Speaker 1]
Anything else? Ed's not here to ask his list of questions.

[Speaker 2]
Gotta get our banner. I'm waiting for that, it should be pretty cool.

[Speaker 1]
Won't show up, because it's an AI file.

[Speaker 2]
I think that one will show up.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that'll be our banner for the booths. All right, well, if nobody else has any questions, I think that's all I have. If you need anything else, in the meantime, please reach out so we can get you taken care of.

Other than that, I will update you as usual if I get any updates before Tuesday. If I don't, I'll see you guys on Tuesday in Telegram. But I think that's everything.

Hopefully everybody has a great, safe weekend. And let me know if you need anything else. But yeah, so far, I'm good with everything still going as expected.

Like I said, actually a little bit better and a little bit quicker, so that's a nice change of pace. We did, oh, actually, this was a major one, and I had it in my notes, too. We did add one more Deb.

So it's actually really nice, because this time around, we're getting several people that, you know, if a Dev disappears or something happens to a Dev or, you know, life happens, we did add one more Dev this morning. So that's super, super exciting. And very good news, I think, for us.

So I'm very, very excited about that. He seems brilliant, and like he really knows what he's doing. So I think that'll be great for us, and will help us continue to hopefully start moving a little bit quicker.

So all right, I will post this recording, I think Ed asked for it, with a few notes, and I will just see you guys in general chat. So let me know if you need anything else. In the meantime, have a great night.
