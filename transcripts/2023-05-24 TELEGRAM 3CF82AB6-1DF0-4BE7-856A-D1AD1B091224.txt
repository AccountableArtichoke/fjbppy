[Speaker 1]
Happy Wednesday. Can you all hear me?

[Speaker 2]
I think it should be good. I don't think we've had a voice on a Wednesday for a while. I'm not seeing otherwise, so I'm gonna assume you all can hear me.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you for your patience. Yeah, happy hump day. I'm sorry we had to postpone the voice till today instead of yesterday.

Just some details. We had to run by everyone and mark the fart in here. Not sure who that is.

Ah, so let's get right to it. You know we've been waiting on the app name change for quite a while. Again, what's behind that is really getting us to just be a little bit more...

Let me turn myself off. Accepted. Illegal.

Not approved. The name. So we're changing the app name until we can possibly in the future change the name of the coin altogether.

Just because FJB has kind of, you know, gone away. Even though we did change it to Freedom Jobs Business, we've really had a hard time getting into even anywhere in the conservative space, whether it's online or brick-and-mortar and real life and rallies, concerts, and stuff like that with everything that FJB comes with. So we have changed the name to Patriot Pay.

That's Patriot spelled Patriot and Pay spelled Pay. P-A-Y. This will be the new name of the app.

We already have the websites, the social media, and everything we need. So super excited about that. I think it'll really help us moving forward.

I think, you know, you hear Freedom Jobs Business, you have no idea what that is. You hear FJB doesn't really tell you what it is. You hear Patriot Pay, you know, I think you have an idea of what it is.

So I think this will help us tremendously. And I think this will be really great to kind of kick us off and help us get started. Patriot Pay doesn't sound like a coin.

Correct. This is the name of the app. So super excited.

I am stoked. I think this will be great for us all around. Definitely more neutral, even though it's still very patriotic, very conservative.

We're going for what we stand for versus the FJB. So yeah, I think I'm excited to finally let that out. Only drawback is it doesn't sound like it could be global.

Hey, why not, you know? And we got to start somewhere. So I think it'll be great.

I think it'll be great. I love it. I love it.

The rest of the team loves it. We tried, you know, there were other names we were considering, but whether there was a trademark or whether there was a name very close to it trademarked, even though it wasn't being used, the list, you know, kind of goes on and on and on. So there were a few other options, but I'll be honest, this one was one of my top favorites from the beginning.

So then we put it on the back burner and I'm kind of glad it came back. So I'm very excited about that. Has Patriot Bay been traded?

So the trademark and the LLC were in the process of that. Yeah, very excited about that. It is very, very recent because like I said, we had some other options that we were waiting to get approved.

And for legal reasons, we decided not to just to be on the safe side. So I really, I really love it. I think it sounds great.

I think it'll really help us.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. I don't know who your daddy is. Okay, let's see.

[Speaker 1]
When war room announcement, once we have our stuff together, Boris said we will discuss that again. That has not changed. Want the t-shirt?

Patriot Bay suggests using the app to pay for things like partnering with businesses. Maybe. Correct.

That's what we're very, very excited for. Businesses, political donations, new coin, PP. Does the rest of the team include the bees?

Yes. PP coin. New logo?

Yes. So we do not have a new logo yet. But we are running, we're going to start a, we're going to run a contest.

And if a logo is, if one of the logos submitted by the community members is chosen, then we'll get a nice payment out to the winner. I'll have details for that by the end of the week, for sure. What's the next step?

All right. So let's move on. Now that we got the new app name out, Patriot Pay, we, so the task is still being worked on by the dev.

He had some difficulties that he was working on. I believe Monday was a little bit, kind of went and spilled into Tuesday. But he's still moving forward.

Everything's going great. I believe we're right under 15 hours of work left on that. So that's still going great.

We are still on track to get that completed by the end of May. But if that does change, I will keep you updated. And you never know.

It might, kind of just like last night, we plan to share the name on the voice chat last night. But fortunately, we didn't get the last call with our attorney till pretty late in the evening. So we're waiting on that.

Let's see. What else? I like the torch logo.

Just use that. So we actually are open to using other variations of the torch. I know some team members before, several months back, kind of had examples with like the American flag inlaid in there, some other ideas.

So I'll write out the details of that contest now that we have the name finalized, and then we'll go from there. So, and again, you know, that's not, who knows, maybe we'll get a nice logo from the community, and maybe we won't. But either way, I think it'll be nice to get everybody involved.

Since we couldn't do that for the name for the, because of the whole website domain issues and people buying that out as soon as they knew websites were in the wedding.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Dev's hands are cramped. Oh, be nice. Don't scare this one away.

Winston said, when will smart, oh, where are we? Oh, okay. Is Winston back?

Oh yes, he's back. When will smart wallet be operational? So the dev is working on the main task.

As soon as we get that all worked out, the main task right now should, is still on track to be completed by the end of the month. However, by definition, like literal textbook definition, there will still be kinks to work on after this task or once this task is pushed through. Um, I want to reiterate that just to ask for your patience in advance.

Um, please. So again, even though the task is on track to be completed by the end of the month, we do expect there to be some things to work through. We don't know how long that will take, but as soon as that's all smooth and as perfect as it can be, then we can either get our same dev or different devs to start on having the smart wallet be a hundred percent functional and the rest of the app.

Uh, the reason we can't do that right now is, you know, we can easily hire other devs to work on that is, uh, because we need this task completed first. So I hope that makes sense. Sorry about being a little bit vague on that.

Um, but I will keep you updated. How will the task be revealed on this Friday's voice chat? I'm not sure about that because once the dev's work is completed, uh, we'll be just running through, should be very quickly running through everything.

Um, and the team just going through everything before it is pushed through before this update is pushed through. Are they looking at integrating any banking as a service? Um, I'm not, I'm not sure these are.

So, um, let me add this to my saved messages. Um, so for questions like this that I'm not sure of, I am no longer going to assume or answer them. Um, but I'll have them saved, um, and answer them when I have an answer.

Um, please try to send me your questions several hours before voice chat. Obviously with this, you had no idea because of the name change. I completely understand that, but for moving forward, we just need to do that to get everything approved and make sure I can get you the most accurate info and the most accurate answers.

Don't love these kinds of kinks. Yes, I, I, I'm with you, but we're moving forward and that's good. Um, I think that's better than us.

Uh, this goes back to BNB, um, being reluctant to have us make, uh, I think any big changes, um, because we just don't want the backlash of the community or, you know, anything like that. Um, but I think this was necessary to move forward for us to move forward, uh, for the future of the app and the coin. Um, so, you know, we did share back, you know, before we even got approved for this task, that that was kind of a lot of where the reluctancy was, um, I believe, and we will get through it.

Again, this is just the textbook definition of it and what we expect. We appreciate your patience, but we will get through it. We have an amazing dev and an amazing team.

Um, I think this is better than kind of sitting there and not being able to do anything and not getting anything approved. Uh, any way to define and break down what the task is? Um, gosh, really not, not really without giving everything away, but I think you will be very, very happy with it.

Um, again, I think this was really necessary. Um, I know this was necessary for the coin, the app, current holders, um, and future holders and merchants. Uh, when you say push through, does that mean push live in the app?

Yes, correct. Okay. Um, let me go through some, so I got a few emailed questions, but actually, or not emailed, I'm sorry, with telegram, DMs, whatever, same, right?

Um, but one person's questions covered them all. So I'm just going to go through his, uh, a few of them were the repetitive. So, okay.

Uh, why has the selection of the app taken so long? Um, that is because we were, there were some names trademarked, even though they weren't being used. Um, that really is the biggest reason.

So we're just kind of, uh, seeing if there's any way around that or playing around with the name to see if we can make it work for us. Um, but we decided to play it a hundred percent safe and go a different direction. Um, again, this was one of my favorites, so I'm glad it worked out.

Um, but this was the team's, uh, next pick. So kind of worked out for the best, I think. How much longer will the task take?

Will it completed, uh, in May as you suggested? I think we already answered that. Uh, it is still on track to be completed by May, but I will update you.

Um, I hate things taking longer than they should because I want to share everything with you, but I think it's for the best. We can't really afford to have anything go super wrong. Okay.

When will the revised and unredacted roadmap be issued? Um, once the task is completed because the task was the only, I think it was one, two, uh, was the name redacted? I'm not sure off the top of my head now, but, uh, once the task is completed that will be, uh, released.

How many hours of work? I think we already went through that. Um, oh no, I'm sorry.

How many hours of work are required to have the app launch ready? Um, so we'll know more about that once the, uh, devs dive into it. Uh, I know when they had issues before it was really very, very simple.

It was just exchanges, uh, changing their minimums or maximums and it kind of screws everything up. Um, so I don't imagine it should be more than a few weeks, but that's a complete guess on my part. Uh, once the devs look into it and like our devs before have said, we get some slow volume, then the more bugs and we'll have, we'll have you guys test it out too again too.

Um, when is the website upgrade and work planned and has the dev for this been advised? No, we were waiting, um, on the name. Now that we have the name, as soon as we have our colors, scheme, and logo figured out, um, yeah, we'll be starting on that.

It'll be, uh, super exciting. Uh, the white paper, when will this be, is there a white paper and when will this be released? Um, so we've, yes, to answer the question, is there white paper?

Yes, there is. Uh, when will it be released? That's really going to depend, um, on the, the task being completed.

Um, I will update you as soon as we have a date on that. As far as gift cards, gift cards are ready, um, but we need this task to be completed and we need the app to be working. Um, when's the, uh, first rally scheduled?

Uh, we have not done that because we don't have our, we, we didn't get this name finalized until today. Uh, when is the dev going to be on a voice chat? Um, like I've said, I think we'll wait until the task is pushed through until we get the dev on just so he doesn't accidentally slip out, uh, what he's working on.

Um, and then when can we expect anything to hear from, anything from Boris? That hasn't changed either. Uh, once we have this task completed and the app ready, Boris, uh, we'll just, we'll discuss that then.

That's been Boris's answer. Uh, so that hasn't changed.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, so I think that was everything. I'm pretty sure.

[Speaker 1]
Um, now we, what I'll do, uh, probably in tonight's announcement with the, uh, voice recording is include all of our new links. Um, we have everything as far as the Discord, Telegram, of course, all the social media, the websites. Um, and then we have the LLC and Trademark, uh, app, apps pending as far as our websites.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. Let me get back to that so I can share that with you. Actually, I know where I have it.

Team chat.

[Speaker 1]
So we have PatriotPay.org. We have PatriotPayApp.com. We have PatriotPay.shop and PatriotPay.store. Um, yeah, unfortunately PatriotPay.com and .io were taken. Um, but I like these ones.

[Speaker 2]
So, um, I think that's everything.

[Speaker 1]
If Boris can't get the confiscated funds, maybe they should run the same. Yeah, so, uh, we had, we had some version two, um, FJB. It was, I mean, so little, but that was, uh, sold a few days ago.

So that was, uh, interesting.

[Speaker 2]
Speaking of confiscated funds.

[Speaker 1]
Will PatriotPay, uh, be in the app when the task is released to the community? Um, we likely will wait till we have our color scheme and logo. That way, um, that'll be pushed through us.

We are version three currently. Uh, what developments are you expecting next? Next task completion.

Uh, then what, uh, after task is completed and we work through getting everything squared away from that and making sure everything is running smoothly. Uh, we will then get the dev to update the app and make sure it's a hundred percent, uh, functional. Uh, during this time, um, as soon as we get the, well, really we can start that ASAP as far as the website, but, uh, we need to get our logo and color scheme going.

I think that'll be, um, fun to get the community involved. Um, ultimately, of course, the team, um, and B&B will have final say, but I think it'll be really fun to get the community involved in that. Um, I'm not sure if we'll keep anything of our current logo, but I'm not sure I want turquoise in our logo.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not sure about you guys. No. Okay.

Uh, so referring to the current roadmap. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So referring to the current roadmap, how do quarter two and quarter three targets look? Um, we obviously will be moving, um, some of those items around. Um, but let's see, we have white paper, website, gift cards, uh, in-person events.

So in-person events will be as soon as we get accepted. Uh, how-to videos. So, uh, the new merch store.

So we already have those links. Um, so as we wait for the task, uh, to be completed and the app to be worked on, um, we will be working on the logo because that really, everything else, the how-to videos, we'll have that because we don't want, we don't want to do the how-to videos, um, until we have the app a hundred percent ready, right? Because we don't want to make how-to videos right now and then have somebody try to follow those a few months later when the app looks completely different.

Uh, the new merch store, um, that's not an issue. Well, actually that, that's also waiting on the colors. Um, and new logo, in-person events, uh, we can start those applications fairly quickly.

They need a little bit of the logo work, but again, not a big deal. Uh, gift cards, those are, uh, completed. Minus, again, the new logos, uh, new website, same thing there, uh, and the white paper.

So all of that, we're waiting on basically the rebranding to be completed and the app. Then we have, let's see, quarter three, crypto and DeFi education begins, FJB Reflections, um, and app version three deployed. Uh, so I think we should still be on track for that.

Live events, new partnerships, and weekly warm-up features. Um, yeah, I think it'll be very busy, uh, next few months, but I think we can still get that done. Let's see, we're in May, uh, yeah, I think, because most of that quarter two stuff we really have, uh, completed.

[Speaker 2]
So, yes, absolutely.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, um, Dogbone says, have a logo contest to develop, develop cool concepts. Um, I'll definitely have that announced, um, and then if we use, if we use the logo or even one of the logos to go off of, then we'll, uh, issue a prize. Uh, since funds from the coin were used to create app, the investor should get part of the tax for each app transaction.

Um, we'll be doing some sort of reflections, um, and share that as soon as it's ready. Uh, in regards to the political donations piece, is that something legal has been looking into before now? Um, yes, legal looked into that, um, several months ago now, I believe.

Um, and there is just a maximum, um, that was the main, really that was the main point that we got from them, was there's a maximum, um, amount that one person can anonymously donate. So, oh, LP, uh, LP lock will happen. It's scheduled to happen right after, uh, this task is, uh, all completed and squared away.

[Speaker 2]
So this will actually do it.

[Speaker 1]
I was seeing if that's on the roadmap, but yeah. All right. So I think that is everything.

Um, I think as of now, we will still meet on Friday on Discord, uh, same time, uh, 7 or 7.30. We'll see what time that works and then, um, go from there. Uh, I'll let you know if there's any other news before that. Um, but again, I appreciate your patience.

Um, we are doing things a bit differently now, so I appreciate your patience. I think, uh, we're on the right track.

[Speaker 2]
So that is all I have.

[Speaker 1]
And then I'll share, uh, once we get our logo going and get that all on social media, I'll share the links with you all tonight in case you want to, uh, just start following everything. And like I said, the Telegram, the Discord, all that too. Um, but I'm very excited.

[Speaker 2]
I think Patriot Pay sounds good. That sounds, uh, very professional.

[Speaker 1]
Um, be nice. All right. Well, thank you all so much.

Have a wonderful night. Uh, as always, DM me if you have any questions or tag me. Um, again, please don't share your seed phrase, um, or enter it into any sketchy links.

Um, me and the other admin, admins will never ask for your seed phrase. So in case somebody is pretending to be me or any of the other admins or any of your fellow, uh, FJB holders, uh, don't hesitate to ask in the main chat. Better safe than sorry.

But again, it's like your bank pin. Please don't ever share that or put it into any sketchy links. I hate when that all happens to one of you.

Um, all right, you all have a great night.
