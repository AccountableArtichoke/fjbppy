[Speaker 1]
Thank you for your patience. I was on a call that took much longer than I thought, otherwise I would have rescheduled the workshop. And then I just needed to get my water with electrolytes, since I am in ketosis.

Hope everybody else is having a better beverage, or a more fun beverage. Okay, updates. I'm sure you all have seen several of the app updates.

One of the major ones was supposed to be the spinning circle. However, I'm getting, I think I've gotten one report of somebody it's still happening to. I will have to see if that's just because your app specifically needs to be reinstalled, or if that's happening with new users.

Let me see. If mine, I keep checking on mine, I haven't experienced it yet. Oh, maybe I'm experiencing right now.

Oh my gosh, I think I am. Oh boy, yes. It's happening to me right now.

Oh, okay. And I didn't delete and reinstall, but. Alright.

Well, that answers my question, so I'll see to work on that. But anyway, marketing isn't stopping for that or anything. You can reload your app, you can close your app.

Again, if you're not closing it after many hours. Let me go back there. I'm sure you've seen other candidates and causes added to the donations page.

We've had some awesome stuff added on the back end that's complete, more of the admin capabilities that mean a lot to you guys, because, again, that frees up dev time, because those are different modifications I'll be able to make instead of taking valuable dev time out of our three devs. The devs are currently working on some more back end stuff. And for the front end stuff, we're working on the classified section.

So that is scheduled to be concluded by tomorrow or Monday, depending on how that goes. So that'll be nice, because then the marketplace will have two options from there. It'll be from businesses and then classifieds.

And then you guys can go ahead and add your own items, and then they'll be up for approval. If they get approved, they get posted. So that's pretty cool.

You'll be able to message different wallets, how you are in the merchant section from businesses. Yeah, we removed the other listings from marketplace. You'll see the stickers one there.

The other ones will be added into the app by the end of the month. Yeah, and you can see, I'm not sure if you've noticed, the function to actually message the merchant, which is really, really awesome. I think that's everything on the app side.

A few minor details, a few major details that you may not notice, just as far as functionality. Yeah, I think that's all there. With our marketing, we were scheduled to actually have something pretty major come out to about 500,000 followers yesterday.

And then today, our influencer is just having a little bit of technical difficulties. So our next one, our next marketing post will be tomorrow. Keeping it light, starting with just a story versus a post from one of our really awesome, gorgeous, brilliant influencers.

A little bit of a smaller following there, under 100K. And then Sunday, we'll go ahead and have her put an actual post that'll stay on the feed. So that'll be nice to kind of slowly roll that in.

Hopefully, we see some awesome traffic from there, even in the chats. We did send out, we sent out some text to some Tennessee Republican voters earlier in the week. We will be sending, depending on how the post with our influencer goes this weekend, the timing of our emails going out will highly depend on that.

Because I have surgery, so just don't want to everything kind of blow up there. But very excited for that. What else?

And then, of course, the influencer that's with the about 500,000 followers, he'll be back in business. Again, likely it'll depend on this weekend's post, but very likely this coming week. We try to stay away from weekend posts.

We try to stay away from Monday and Friday posts, because generally, that's just not a great day to market anything. I know, even with me, Monday's kind of getting back into the groove, going to get back to everybody, checking my emails and catching up on life. And then, of course, everybody has a life and families and all that.

And then Friday, usually everybody's checked out by then. Summer week is usually pretty good. Trying to do around lunchtime, Eastern.

But again, we figured this week would be a holiday weekend. We'll see how it goes. Let's go into the chats.

I don't think – actually, I do have a few. I was going to say, I don't think I have any DMs, but I am lying. I do have a few DMs. Oh, we'll also do – to be honest with you guys, I was going to do it this weekend, but I am preparing for surgery. And I have – I'm super busy with everything Patriot Pay, so other things are taking a priority. But I have not forgotten about your refunds for testing in the app. I will get back to DMs. I know I've only gotten back to the urgent ones, but I will get back to your DMs. Also, I'll try to do it here within the next 24 hours. But if I don't, I promise I will get to them. I have not forgotten about them. Just other things have taken a priority.

Patriot Pay-wise, it has been – we think it would be slow with holidays, but my gosh, everybody had my ass kicked. Whoops. Excuse my language.

Hopefully you guys don't have your kids listen. Hold on. Let me check.

Sorry, I'm checking my GKI, which if you're going into surgery or anything like that, you should definitely be. You should be into – Hope everybody's having a fun work. Hopefully a fun one.

All right. 71 divided by 18 divided by 2. 1.9. Look at that. Therapeutic level. Okay. Now I can get back to you.

Sorry. I have to measure that. Poking.

Poking all the fun stuff. Let me put this away, and I will get into the chats for your questions. I have to figure out kind of where I'm at to decide what I can have for dinner.

Probably the Bound B thing. Okay. Let's see.

Happy 4th, Wolvie. Thank you. It's been an awesome one.

I actually went to the store because I was picking up gifts to give everybody involved with my surgery, nurses and whatever, everybody involved, desk people, whatever. And it was a nightmare out there, so I totally regret not doing that sooner. But it's been an insane week here with work.

I did a delete and reinstall. The circle loads for about 5 minutes. Looks sharp.

But for Mike, you did experience the spinning circle after the delete and install, though, right? 500,000 followers is pretty significant, yes. Also, the influencers we are collaborating with have definitely higher than average engagement.

So, yeah. They're very actually excited about that. Curious to how it will go.

It's such a fine line, but we'll find exactly where we fit in well. Because we are marketing something that's completely different. Although the plus side of that is that you have the potential to dominate the market, especially with how much time, money, talent, everything you've poured into this.

But the downside, or one of the downsides could be a downside, is that it is a market you actually have to break into. You have to make. So that comes with the pros and the cons.

Because a lot of conservatives have no idea what crypto is. I know I'm reading some of the responses to the text messages we sent out. And most of them are great.

Some of them, you can tell, very small percentage, but are like, a few Republicans, so probably a number change or something. Because I don't think that Republicans, very many Republicans turn into Democrat voters. But I received one that was like, clearly it was a Republican voter.

It seemed like it from whatever else he said. But he said, oh, so I can lose my money after my phone gets hacked. So there's a lot.

There's a lot to do, a lot of work to be done out there. But we plan to really break into that through the education videos. I would have thought people being connected to their phones and social media accounts near on 24-7 when I care if it's Tuesday lunchtime or Saturday night.

Thank you for posting that. Oh, we the people. Grabbing another beer.

Lucky. I did get a few gluten-free beers. They've been in my fridge for a while because I haven't really drank for a while.

I'm going to try them out and see how they are. Happy 4th. Happy 5th beer.

Happy 4th of July free bird. What kind of marketing is planned in addition to the influencer emails? We have influencers, email campaign, ads, podcasts.

And we'll get back into the swing of events. That's what I can think of off the top of my head right now. I'm so mad at myself, though.

When I went to the store to get the gifts for everybody that's going to be doing my surgery, a guy was going into his truck with a Trump hat. And I feel, this is so funny, but I feel like he would have fit perfectly in our chats. So I complimented on his hat, but I was so sad that I didn't have a card or anything.

I was like, well, should I just download the app or just give him my number? But then I didn't want him to think I was hitting on him or anything. Glucose, ketone index, are you fasting?

No, I'm not fasting. I am into ketosis. Deep into ketosis.

Probably been a few, several days now, actually. I'll stay into ketosis. I'll probably get out of it.

Refuel with glucose tomorrow for lunch. And then probably jump back into ketosis. And then probably stay into that until several days after surgery.

Okay, so you are still experiencing that circle. Yeah, that's going to have to just honestly take a little bit of a backseat. All other more urgent things get done.

I know it's super annoying, but yeah. I do appreciate you guys do continue letting me know when it happens. Just so we know how often it's happening.

Any progress with education videos? Yes, our video guy, now that he's done with the launch video. So, back to work on that.

Does the chat box work in the app? So, there's two. There's a support chat box in the app.

Yes, that does work. It works both with the bot, if nobody's online. And the bot, we're still working on to get some brains on that bot.

And then once somebody gets online, generally within a few hours, there'll be a live person. That live person being me will help you out. And then there's another chat box.

And if you go into marketplace and you go to specific item, you'll see a box at the bottom. That's a box where you can message. Using your wallet.

Super cool. Whoever is the owner of that item. The business owner of the person selling you the item.

Can you tell us when the first podcast is planned? No, because we're going, like we're figuring that out as we go. Depending on how long it is.

What happened with the education? Oh, I just answered that. Yes, we have a few last contests that haven't paid out.

And we will be winning. And so we actually need to check the transferred sum. I'm going to start soon to hear the transferred sum.

That's my word. If it wasn't updating, let me see. Into Discord.

Marketplace question box. That's pretty neat. It's actually some really awesome Wallet-to-wallet messaging.

How cool is that? Okay. So I tried getting my TTY in Discord.

But I guess. Tip CC is having issues. Would you look at that?

I'm going to have to fill out a form now. To get my deposit. So I was trying to pay you.

To get you guys out. Let's see. This report has been sent to the dev.

It will be taken care of ASAP. Due to increased amounts. Okay.

Cool. So hopefully. Tip CC will send the rest of my funds.

Okay. You might want to specify. The message is going to the vendor.

I can definitely see that. We'll see what to do about that. Thank you.

Are they going to provide a history of donations in the app? Yes. Definitely.

That is on the list. Oh, that's another. Actually.

The. You may have noticed. The orders page has been updated.

To include. Status. A little bit less cleaned up.

With the date and time. That way it should be a little bit easier for you guys to. Figure out your transaction history.

Okay. Oh, gee. Fireworks have begun.

I don't know if you guys heard that. Does anybody else's neighborhood. Like get blown up with people asking.

If gunshots went off. On the 4th of July. Can you give us an overview.

Of what's planned for July. So. Marketing.

Will be ramped up. And we'll just. Gauge as we go from there.

Finding that fine balance. Of getting. Users.

Signed up. With the app. Of course.

Buying TTY. And then hopefully transacting with it. Hold on.

Let's see on the app. Classified. Should be well completed.

And working by then. The. Several items.

Will be added to. The marketplace. A few more candidates.

Will be added to the donations page. That will be happening. Sooner than later actually.

What else. Gift cards. We're just waiting on some.

Banking. With the third party there. Actually two third parties.

Have those also into the marketplace. Which will be really cool. There will be a limit.

On. Those. But it'll be.

Sticker. Get a gift card. That'll be nice.

Because you can. Use your card. To purchase the gift card.

July. Coffee should be. One thing I noticed.

About the spinning circle issue. Is that the chat bubble. Does that mean there is.

A connection to the app. We've done that. It's several factors.

The chat bubble. Is independent. Of most everything in there.

Because the chat. Bubble doesn't require. The same.

Basically security. That the app does. To get you connected.

That's why you may still see it there. Yeah. I appreciate that Mike.

Basically. The chat button is a. Plugin straight into.

The app. And then you use. The.

Chat. Plugin with another. Cloud service.

To make it work. So that we can access those. Messages from an app.

And email. To get back to. How close do you think.

We're getting the coffee. I hope we can have coffee. By the end of the month.

Along with the. Several other products in there. Some things have been.

More challenging than others. But the coffee has done it easily. And I'm excited for that too.

To be honest. Lately. I've been really lazy.

Using. Just like. The pods.

At it. Is 0.4827. Well. You know.

I think. That just. Means.

Think about what happens. To when. Matic.

Doubles again. The nice thing about Matic. Is it's so young.

That it has so much room. For growth still. There's crazy amount of grants.

Out there even. For a lot of. Matic related.

Anything. So I have no doubt. About that.

One of the biggest reasons. That we need to Matic. Will there be whole bean.

Yes the coffee is whole bean. As volume grows. We can definitely make different ones.

But for now it will be one roast. Whole bean. You grind it how you want to.

Which I like. Because. I drink coffee in any form.

I do it finer. For the espressos. And then.

A lot larger. Of a grind. For the cold brew.

Or the french press. Now that the app is marketable. Do you think Boris might pop in.

And say hi at some point. We definitely want. To test the app.

Which I know. Especially some of you. Have tested it a ton.

But we just want to make sure. The app is solid. Solid.

Before having. Steve or Boris. Boris first.

Try it out. Gosh I can't believe. I forgot to wash my water.

I should probably at least do something. Yeah it's weird. I was craving hot coffee today.

Even though it's like 13 minutes in. I didn't have it though. I had the ice.

I think that is. All I have. I need to get back to work.

Alright. Yeah. I think that's.

All I have. Please remember. To.

Oh there's a scammer. With my same exact. Photo.

And name today. Again remember. I will never DM you first.

I will ask you. I'll tag you and ask you to DM me. If you're ever in doubt.

Please know. I will never ask you for money. Or to send over anything.

I think that Sarah earlier asked. Ed for. A tiny $4000.

So just be careful with that. I'm sure as we. Ramp up the volume.

We'll get. Just be careful. And then remember.

Don't share the email code. That gets emailed to you. That is pretty much like your pay.

Again. Yeah. Shouldn't let somebody log in.

If they're not in your same location. But just be safe. Don't get in the habit of it.

Have an amazing. Fourth of July. Hopefully you have a good one.

Hopefully your dogs. Aren't. Scared.

In the meantime. I do ask for your. Patience regarding.

DMs again. I have been getting back to. The really urgent ones.

I am not ignoring you. If I haven't gotten back to you. I'm just buried in work.

And trying to prioritize. So I do appreciate you guys. I appreciate every one of you.

And I will get back to you. I'm just trying to. Prioritize into getting.

Everything else pushed. Yeah. But you all have a safe night.

Hopefully everybody has their fingers. Breaking into the night still. I'll probably just watch some.

Fireworks in my backyard. My backyard neighbors. Go nuts.

Every year. It's nice having them so close though. But yeah.

I think that's it. Yes. Starting tomorrow I think.

About 80. Some thousand. Followers there.

So we'll see what kind of volume. Actually kind of worked out. So our original plan anyway.

Was to have this influencer first. Naturally to see how it would go. With 80 something thousand followers.

Before we jump right. Under like 500k. So it.

It worked out fine. We'll see how it goes. All right.

And go from there. You are welcome. You are welcome.

I've never tried that. I've seen it and I've heard about it. And I've actually meant to try it.

I just don't have all the. Contraptions. And I have so many coffee.

Things. Machines. App needs to prove itself.

You know. It's kind of like one of those things. The longer you go.

And the longer you build it. You're like I'm not going to have. Boris or Steve try it now.

After all this time. And then have it glitch on them. Like that.

We just cannot afford it. We cannot afford. To make that mistake.

So yes. App does need to prove itself. Especially after the history.

It's had. Fresh ground is a way to go. Yes.

That way it could be fresh. That way it lasts longer. That way you all can choose.

However you want to grind it. All right. I think that is.

Everything. I'm going to eat dinner really quickly. And get back.

To work here. Let me know if you need anything else. In the meantime again.

Thank you for your patience. While I take a few days. To get back to your.

Less urgent DMs. You all have a wonderful night. And then we will as soon as I get. My tip.

CC fixed. I just filled out the form. It said due to volume it could take a few days.

And then it said to refill the form again. If you're still waiting. But hopefully.

They deposit my funds. Sooner than later. So that way we can do some.

Tips in there while we have. A little bit of marketing going. You all have a wonderful night.

I will post this. I don't know. Maybe I'll post a contest.

If you guys are up to it. What we'll do is have the same contest. Where you all send.

Some. PPY to. Somebody else.

But they have to make a. Patriot pay account. And send them some PPY.

It doesn't matter the amount. It's the thought that counts. Getting them to get in there.

Show them how cool it is. Alright. Thank you guys.

I will. Oh next voice chat. Okay.

So I'm not sure. Just because depending on how my surgery goes. I will keep you updated.

So I'm not sure if it will be Tuesday. I am going to stay in ketosis. For the most part.

To try to heal quicker. And be able to help everybody out. But I will update you.

For now we'll just put a pin in it. It is not Tuesday. It is to be determined.

FYI. And I'll make sure to put that in the voice notes. So you all remember that.

Have a wonderful night. Again. Thank you for your patience.

With me being late to the meeting. And. You all have a good one.
