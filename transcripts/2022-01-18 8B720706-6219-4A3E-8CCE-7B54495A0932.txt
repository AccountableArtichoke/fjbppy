[Speaker 3]
going on man I can't hear you anybody else here Eric now geez Louise where's

[Speaker 3]
perfectly no he's gonna try on a different device okay I could talk I'll

[Speaker 2]
take a second today was a great day if you guys tuned into war room but we have some some clips and some some sound bites we'll probably be sending out or continuing to send out from that it was a little bit short-winded but the great thing is war rooms on every day and Eric is coming back on war room tomorrow so we're gonna hear much more he's probably he wants to summarize kind of when of what he said tonight tomorrow on war room so that's gonna be awesome really excited about that he said that he is going to be using a different device I don't how many devices he has I'm sure he has a bunch but our telegram numbers are increasing discord no see that's good because I hopped in here with like what 125 people here and we're up to 177 in the discord and another 11 on the telegram so we're getting there we're getting there we're getting there also happy birthday to Sun Devil Sarah she has been absolutely killing it on all of our socials day in and day out so I want to everybody to wish happy birthday everybody say happy birthday and tag at Sun Devil 28 she is extremely amazing and we wouldn't be here without her she does all of our socials she I think she sleeps 30 minutes a night it's like an elf when he says he slept all of 40 minutes that's what she's like and she's here every single day enthusiastic chilling pumping the crowd up answering questions I think she's in the telegram and discord at the same time it's really amazing so happy birthday to her couldn't be couldn't be happier to have her he got some tips going there Sarah which is awesome all right I'm just waiting for Finn to pop up what's been pops up here then we're gonna be all set no worries thank you guys all for your patience hey you know what we have technical difficulties am I gonna blame discord yeah a thousand percent am I gonna blame pirate handy-taker for being here maybe it might be his fault is it Wegg's fault I don't know but we got to blame somebody and I'm gonna blame somebody from discord it's but I think it's I think it's pirates fault he said maybe maybe it's Tuan maybe it's like maybe it's Dak Prescott's fault I don't know but we

[Speaker 3]
gotta blame somebody all right let's see let's see all right all right we're getting there he said no hug no voice so somebody's

[Speaker 2]
gotta hug fees before or he can get him up here because I think that I think fees he's a moderator so I think he's shut it down because of that there's

[Speaker 3]
somebody give him a hug oh one second one second one second I agree Wegg I agree with you we got 181

[Speaker 2]
in here though we're climbing people are not leaving you know what I mean Oh Eric's calling me one second one second I'm gonna mute

[Speaker 3]
all right so I just talked to Eric he's gonna try one more time in here he called

[Speaker 2]
me oh crap I oh I'm back I'm back and I'm back in the telegram I'm sorry to all my telegram people that were listening trying to get everything all squared away he's 183 in here though let's get the 200 why not exactly so worst-case scenario he's just gonna talk through him talk through my phone speaker so he might just call me and then we'll just we'll just play play oh he's in here I'm gonna invite him up all right Eric he said he can hear us loud and clear Eric try it third time's a charm you have like push to talk enabled or if you're on your cell phone or I know that discord can be really tricky I know we had a Tom McNaughton here from the NFTs last week oh he just he just he just left sometimes like it it's muted discord is muted on your on your screen oh you hear me fine okay I don't know

[Speaker 7]
why it was off mute and then I just turned it on and off and then it worked

[Speaker 2]
so I guess this is good Eric it's it's discord I'm but I said I was blaming discord now I'm sticking with my guns with blaming discord on

[Speaker 7]
this amazing amazing perfect perfect I'm so glad yeah amazing well I hope it's worth the wait you know and everything I

[Speaker 1]
think it will be but it's so glad to be on board this project guys and it's so great to meet all of you I mean absolutely truly a pleasure and you know it's been a good day it's been a good day I think for FJB I definitely think

[Speaker 2]
so it's been a very exciting day start off with it with war room and since then I've saw endless tweets endless stock twits posts everybody was shilling like crazy a lot of positive emotions and positive feelings about FJB today without

[Speaker 1]
a doubt I mean just truly truly amazing and it was just so fun being in the chat with everybody and it was a huge pleasure and I just think and this is what Grant and I were talking about earlier which was that you know I mean truly the FJB and I think you I heard this a little bit when I was trying to join which is you know my main my main goal of being a part of this being an investor in this and being an advisor of this is pushing this in the direction of basically getting the 75 million plus people who voted for Trump to to use cryptocurrency and to get off of this existing banking system that has banned Flynn banned Trump banned so many others has affected me on my own projects I mean it's insane right so this is that that's why I feel like you know I said this so I'm over time I got payment processors freeze on three million of my dollars within 24 hours which was crazy and this was just money made off of an incredible project I did but you know that that's crazy so I feel like joining

[Speaker 3]
FJB and investing on this point this is my peaceful revenge on these payment

[Speaker 1]
processors because it's it's it's crazy out there they're being I mean I'm preaching to the choir here but I but I mean this is really the true use case of crypto like so many people over the years asking what is the use case of crypto well you know I'm probably in the first world in the West Western civilization probably good as an investment good as a form of security if if shit goes down on the world but now you can see conservatives are seeing the window because conservatives are getting treated like second-class citizens in this country it's absolutely absurd and and this is why basically they're forcing us I had hoped the Trump administration would enact laws that didn't allow people to politically persecute people with technology or make up some something so it's not technically political persecution at all but I don't know the Republicans just weren't able to do it which is a damn shame but it's forcing us to create systems like FJB and others so anyways

[Speaker 3]
thanks thanks for your patience everybody for for waiting for me gone definitely Eric and you're you started to tell it off a little bit towards the

[Speaker 2]
end I'm a little bit of disconnection but we know but we hear you loud and clear I think it's just like every 10 seconds or so my cut out for a second but if you would you would you want to give a quick rundown of your history and some background on yourself so I know some people are messaging in here wondering who you are then they googled you and they got all excited but it's probably better to hear from you itself you know what I mean yeah absolutely so I

[Speaker 1]
mean a little bit about my background is I am basically here I'll start from the beginning my older brother brought me to this protest actually in and it was a Ron Paul I don't know if people are familiar with Adam Kokesh but it basically this guy would find these crazy laws all around the country and and you know break them right so if it was like you know in some countries there's like literally a legal type of cupcake but in this one it is illegal to dance at the Jefferson Memorial so he went and he danced at the Jefferson Memorial and he basically got

[Speaker 3]
harassed

[Speaker 1]
which was crazy and and then anyways he was arrested for that body slammed on I don't know if it's concrete or granite floor up there you know knee on the neck by the by the park officers I guess and and then yeah that that was it and we went to all go protest that my older brother brought me to this protest I was like 11 or 12 and and then yeah we went to go protest and it was like you know it's like a full loose like protests and people were arrested for dancing was horrible and then you know they had riot police Blackhawk helicopters circling the place and I shit you not this is this is this is completely true and and then anyways in the middle of running from the police I noticed this guy had this orange shirt on with a B that looked like a dollar sign and and I said what's what's that and he's like it's a it's it's Bitcoin man it's gonna end Wall Street bro and then he ran off and then yeah then I went home got into Bitcoin from there and I guess the rest is history had enough money I dropped at a high school started a company moved to San Francisco Silicon Valley when I was 15 sold that company around 17 you know 15 I was like interviewed by Charlie Rose back when that was a cool thing to say before everybody found out he was a pervert I guess and everything so I mean you know good good another one from the mainstream media there but it's but that that was interesting sold that company gave a TED talk thing you know eventually had enough money famously became the youngest Bitcoin millionaire at 18 shortly after that because when I sold my company I put all that money back into Bitcoin so that was amazing and then and then yeah then I it was cool like did some other projects basically because I had some fun money we won a grant from NASA for the Alana mission I worked with a group of students actually on that and we launched a satellite with a time capsule on it to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Voyager mission we which had people like Taylor Swift contribute to that which was really cool um you know she sent us just a mixtape of her favorite music and a personal message but wouldn't say it's the whole world we we got one video from almost every country in the world and that launched a few days later I think I turned around 20 so I was like a three-year kind of side project if you will with a with a group of other great people and we got like people like that Burt Rutan who made spaceship one that's in the Smithsonian as like the first private manned spaceship to a Peter Diamandis Charles Lindbergh's like great-grandson Eric Lindbergh to help out with that project and then and then also had another side project I guess after that which was to make a real-life dr.

octopus suit which was crazy and it was just a prototype but we put it on and it worked really well and that video went super viral and because you know I was just basically a teenager trying to have some fun with my life and then at 20 years old I wanted to kind of get into getting more consumers into crypto I worked on this project called coin bits and which was which was really cool which was like acorns for crypto if you're if you know what acorns is so basically if you swipe your card connect coin bits your card swipe it you pay something that's like a dollar fifty it'll round it up to or dollar fifty one it'll round it up to two dollars put the remaining 49 cents into Bitcoin for you so that was really cool then she moved on to a company called a metal pay which was amazing and that was just a super easy to use crypto wallet and I was an investor there which was very cool and but you know that that's I wanted to kind of get into more conservative world and and everything in there they're they're kind of you know like something you have conservatives Democrats there I want to go full conservative because that's my passion and I got into the freedom phone project and that was an incredible launch on in so many ways you know obviously the left-wing media pretended they had the phone and and wrote reviews or hands-on or thoughts on the phones about asking or knowing anything about the technology but we got again three million dollars in sales in that first day payment processors basically were like screw you and and then you know said we're gonna put all this in a reserve for six months which is insane when it's like hey I'm a merchant or a business trying to offer a product and and these are customers that want to pay me and and for that product and then they hold all the money right and that's a that's a you know that was tough because we had to shell a lot of money out of pocket we had to make back money and everything even one of the payment processors PayPal I think we made one and a half million of our sales through that they forcibly actually know this is on top of the three million so we mean they forcibly funded 1 million customers 1 million dollars of customers and then and then you know kept about 500,000 in a reserve for like and like seven months which was crazy and everything and there's still money some money stuck in reserves and it's just crazy that you know hey like I said we're a business wants to help wants to serve serve our customer and the customer wants to pay me money for that service and then they hold all their money which is absurd and crazy and then you know and then and then after a couple months we call them and say dude can you you know we called them instantly we call it every day and then after a while they're like hey you have a high chargeback rate and it's like well why do you think that is because you know we have three million dollars of inventory to ship so we basically had the front all this cost of inventory without even receiving money for it to get people on their phones I mean it was absurd and then you know thankfully the remaining back order of that is still is is going out you know throughout this week which is good but you know that that that slowed us down and then plus once we got the money you know we had to basically you know these supply chain issues slowed us down so the shipping customs was a whole mess so I mean just just but I'm more focusing on payment processing right now because that was the big pain and you know you see how they shut down my pillow that was a bank which was insane I mean you know again just I just realized that you know a conservators are getting treated like second-class citizens now and we have to build our own technology out just to have the rights of I feel like normal normal people have a normal payment processor have a normal you know bank you know be able to store your money use credit cards yeah I mean it's absurd and you know and it's only happening to more people so little rant there of my background and everything and that I mean that that whole thing was like I need to join FGB and be an investor an advisor to it because it was just like you know someone needs to solve this and I think most crypto projects are focused on coin price and don't get me wrong coin price is great but I think that no other coin this is totally biased in my opinion no other coin has the potential to actually be used as a currency or you have actual utility as a currency you know because you know conservative mom-and-pop shops can choose to take it I mean that's really what I want to advise this coin and push them into is making it super easy for normal people to get into not just crypto people like me and probably a lot of people on this chat are but truly just normal people and that's and that's just the number one thing and and I think we can actually get people to use this as you know with businesses small businesses around the United States 75 million plus Trump supporters and I hope that sends a message to these banks and payment process say hey you can't you know we're going to find a way around you and everything so anyway so that's that's that's why I'm joining FGB just because I just want some quote-unquote peaceful revenge on these on these payment processors that are just treating me my customers and so many other conservatives like second-class citizens

[Speaker 2]
that's awesome and I think you hit on a lot of great points and one of them being the fact that the left-wing media really came after you for freedom phone although it was a tremendously successful launch and that's why one of the reasons why you're here is that is that peaceful revenge on those payment processors because that's what FGB is trying to do and it's just it's so crazy how misconstrued things can be because like I said freedom phone is is tremendous it's a great product with awesome technology and because love it if you look at the actual reviews of it it's tremendous it's only the left-wing

[Speaker 1]
media that really tries to target it yeah exactly and and I knew I knew that would be the plan but but that's that's I guess that's the whole point of this

[Speaker 2]
but no you're absolutely right grant definitely absolutely and and we couldn't be happier to have you up here when we first got Eric you and I probably talked the first time a little bit over two and a half three weeks ago and since then I've just been so fired up to have you on the project and to finally get you announced and ready to go on here and I know you have thousands of ideas and we're very fortunate very lucky to have you because I think I said this like week three or four of the project the projects about 85 days old but I think that we're like building the Monstars like in Space Jam and I think that we were we're getting there we really are getting there and adding you to the team is is fantastic and I think this is a like this was day one of the project in my head this was day 86 of the project unofficially but this was day one because now we start a new beginning we kind of closed the chapter closed the book on the last part of the coin and now we open up and we really move forward from here and it's it's I can't wait to see how everything unfolds we can hear you you kind of broke up for a second but I'm sure that you're going to be all clear in just a second just that kind of has been going yeah let me

[Speaker 3]
we're losing you for it just got substantially worse I don't know how I tried again we're just getting into the into the meat and potatoes of it too I was getting excited oh no I think he was just giving us the keys to the city right there I think he's down there I'll let him up here to speak all right

[Speaker 2]
Eric I invited you up here hopefully this works you also have increasing numbers in both the telegram and in here which is really awesome we have a 183 in here I'm gonna invite then back up I think he's getting oh there I can hear

[Speaker 3]
me oh no we just got to get him clear for just another couple minutes just just to

[Speaker 2]
get what he's looking to say oh I saw his microphone talk for just a second

[Speaker 3]
you he said mute unmute again mute unmute again what if I do this what if I mute you then I unmute you I don't know if I me doing that does

[Speaker 2]
anything see him shoot he's he left for a second this has been this has been a little bit of a difficult time however best part about it is he's getting back on war room tomorrow Eric is getting back on war room always calling me one second oh perfect yeah can you guys can everybody hear Eric I just unmuted myself on my laptop now yes he said it's so silly it's so silly so so yeah we also got another heads up clear so Eric you want to take some questions correct yeah awesome awesome awesome so if anybody has any questions in the general chat I know we probably have a tremendous amount so the first one that

[Speaker 1]
I've been seeing is is how did you hear about FJB yeah absolutely because because

[Speaker 2]
we got in contact through through Boris and Boris mentioned mentioned yourself and I did a quick Google search for you I was like absolutely let's get let's get this thing so it was it was so exciting in that sense and that like I said there's about three weeks ago and since then it's it's been quite a ride and now we're here another question we just got what are some future can you hear me Eric yeah so somebody said what are some of your future plans that you

[Speaker 1]
plan to take FJB coin to the next level anything you can clue us in on yeah I

[Speaker 2]
these people make the funniest memes

[Speaker 1]
just making this easy for normal people to get into and I think that's and cards and banks and everything and and getting but don't have the time to figure out how I what is an exchange for example and everything I mean that's that's basically it's basically just super easy to be able to people to use this actually as a as a form of trade you know between people and everything just super super easy and I think once we figure out that problem you know I think that's will be rewarded handsomely for it and in many ways so I mean that's that's basically it and they'll be future stuff next Monday coming out about that

[Speaker 2]
awesome so just quick summary for some people that a little bit robotic for just a second but we heard you you said that more information is going to be coming next week regarding this about the plans of FJB and essentially the number one priority on our list is is that ease of use is that ease of getting of transacting with FJB that's our number one focus and like we said more information is going to be coming up out about that next week and we're just I'm pumped for you guys all I'm pumped for for the world to hear and I'm pumped for to keep working on that another question we had was how will FJB and Freedom Phone interact or intersect

[Speaker 1]
yeah absolutely absolutely and again apologies for my internet I'm kind of in the middle of nowhere right now so that that is also another problem on everything so my phone is dead my laptop is dead so like I'm on my I'm on my iPad because I use that the least so again apologies but thank you for everybody's

[Speaker 2]
patience but real quick repeat that question somebody said how do you see the Freedom Phone and FJB interacting if you see any future collaboration I

[Speaker 1]
think that's another thing to touch on on Monday because I think what what will be coming out Monday next week I think will or that kind of going into more details that will tie also as a double into the Freedom Phone as well so I think that will all make sense but I mean tons of collaboration between Freedom Phone and and FJB coin I mean people don't really realize how many Freedom Phones we have sold just because the media you know I mean look at like you know there's a who's the boss video and he did like a whole fake hands-on that's like a million views it's absurd I mean it's it's but I mean we have done so well you know especially when we had our backs against the wall for a little bit so I mean it's there's an opportunity to get a bunch of new people into FJB

[Speaker 2]
coin with with Freedom Phone absolutely and you were saying that we're going to be clued in a little bit more on on Monday and there will be some we'll know more about the collaboration between the Freedom Phone and FJB knowing more coming very soon you got time for one more question tonight Eric yeah the connections the connection is great now I just got worried just perfect

[Speaker 1]
perfect yeah so basically so but but yeah here I see some of these questions on do you see FJB being used as a decentralized payment for conservative companies such as my pillow for example absolutely I mean I just think that's that's that's what we want to get the payment processing business I mean that's that's basically it right and obviously doing that as legally and compliantly as possible and well you know totally possible right let's see here I love I love the Boris jokes I just I goddamn love them they're hilarious let me see here do I see any other other other things

[Speaker 2]
here do you have any other good questions grant yeah they come in fast we enabled slow-mo to it if you don't have slow mode on during voice it's like it's like a running ticker like SportsCenter on the bottom it's like did it did the trader Joey B said any chance to get this cross bridge on other l1s and provide liquidity so there isn't reliance on any one network yeah I mean

[Speaker 1]
absolutely absolutely plans for that you know period you know of course right and and then and then yeah and then we'll also at some point we're gonna I see some things in here at some point we're gonna allow people on for freedom phone to be able to accept not on the phones but on our website and then we'll talk more about how we can incorporate on the phones itself on Monday next week but we want to start accepting FGB coin for those phones absolutely that's a great short-term thing to do so that's that's good someone said freedom pad in the phone call but but I think so because my iPad is performing very poorly I paid $1,500 for this thing so this is not good but I just think it's because I'm in the middle of the woods but someone a lot of a lot of chats with the 8% tax economics that's something that we're gonna address probably not next Monday but that's something that we're absolutely gonna address at a later date that is a hundred percent on my mind and before I decided to go into this project I asked you know Grant and Boris and everybody said before I before you know there's any any advising or or or about investing in the coin whatever this was that was one of my most important things to me and I think and I got some really good answers and I gave some suggestions and they've been taking those suggestions so that will that will come at a later point and everything so I mean that's that that is something that's absolutely on our minds let's see here let's see here someone asked me what is your biggest political related fear ie policies I mean this is the thing I mean I just think that you got to be careful with the federal government that's the beauty of crypto is these things like you know these things exist as its own system right but you know good to good to be as always legally compliant as possible but that's my fears that the federal government just does not understand crypto and will make mistakes in regulating crypto or like the top exchanges or the top crypto players they like the confusion and everything and then they will they will was gonna say they will like like to keep that the rules vague in a way and then they can hire lobbyists and lawyers etc to basically enforce their monopoly I did a bill called the Cryptocurrency Act of 2020 which was an incredible launch but basically we launched it right as when kovat started and you know talking to anyone any congressperson about it was like anything other than kovat was like you know not happening we might actually reintroduce that later than everything so I mean but it's that was a crypto bill I'm basically making like a crypto bill of rights to make it very simple if you're just a startup to be able to get launch a crypto company because that's the problem is right now you need basically millions of dollars to get these legal licenses in the United States to be able to have like a feel to create a fiat crypto on ramp so I mean you know imagine if it took a million dollars to start up any business in the country whatsoever like even like a small restaurant or anything you just have just these big you'd only have McDonald's right you wouldn't have that artisan home cooked mom-and-pop you know tasty hole-in-the-wall right so I mean that's that's something that that we focus on I think at least I focusing on an FGB and I think investors and FGB value that and everything but I mean that's my biggest fear is that these people will just not understand someone said what part of Idaho are you from I grew up in Boise I grew up in Coeur d'Alene which is like North Idaho Boise's in South Idaho and everything but I mean my biggest thing that I want to advise FGB on again I'm kind of ranting here at this point is is that is is that this is it is a meme but it is not a meme coin and I think that this is I just think objectively I guess objectively but also in my opinion this has the power to get to all the 75 million plus people who voted for Trump and to actually not just be and have this be actually used as a utility in this country and widespread in this country I think we'll get more people to use this I get totally biased in my opinion I think we'll get more people to use this then actually use it for its utility than any other coin that exists I mean that's the goal right and I want to show and I think we should show everybody that and I think that is the trajectory that we're on and I think we got a big positive response in the chats in the community with the whales and everything of people seeing I think like I wouldn't do that I wouldn't join this project if I didn't feel like I don't join mean projects basically I just don't and I just think that this is this just has so much capability of it to be one of the biggest technologies in the country I mean just period and I'm not just again I'd say that totally biased you know but anyways let me see let me look at some more questions here if you have any more good questions I'm

[Speaker 2]
looking a lot of the same things I'm just trying to read about some of these said somebody said well what other utility might be planned to add demand to the coin gamification farm options for long-term holders to earn incentives via

[Speaker 1]
staking etc I think that's a future conversation I'm in everything but I mean basically in so many ways what I want actually be coin to be and also freedom phone and there's also some other companies I'm kind of joining if you will as an advisor in one way or another it's just basically what I love is getting normal people in the p5 and that's what I think FJB can be and we're also gonna I mean we're gonna have great conversations in the future about the technology of this coin the tokenomics of this coin that I think will make people very happy as well but I just think what's beautiful this is a way for normal people that have heard about crypto to be able to get into crypto be able to use it for what crypto was meant to be used for as a utility and and kind of be a little bit of a spoonful of sugar to get into defy I mean I just think defy it's just so you know I mean I just I just I just don't trust these days I just don't trust you know these people are scumbags in so many ways and they don't they don't give a crap about you I mean there's actually this is then this is kind of a maybe a populist turn here but like I remember I was I was talking to this to this politician at the time and I won't say who I was a senator though and and he was one of the top people in the Senate he's a Democrat actually and he is retired now but I asked him I said I said why did you bail out the bank why didn't you give money because you know right like it was like people were you know like it was a mortgage basically payment problem right they were they were giving mortgages to people that maybe didn't deserve all this all of all of you know didn't have the credit proper credit to be able to you know pay their mortgages and classify them all but why didn't you when you bailed out these these organizations that were basically you know folding under this under this financial crash over this basically mortgage basically problem why didn't you go fund the homeowners directly be able to pay their mortgages back to these banks right because it's the same amount of money and and he told me he said I don't know we don't want to I forgot the words that he used but it was basically like we don't want to set a precedent of the United States you know bailing out normal normal people with money you know even though it's the same cost of money to bail to basically you know cover up the cost of this of this failure but you know one way helps just the banks and the other way helps the banks and the people right and I just they just said well he told the guy told me it's like the thinking at the time was we don't want to set a precedent that we can bail out people's mortgages and less people will vote for that and that will you know become unsustainable and that was it right and I was like well what about these bankers I mean they continue voting for that they continue fundraising for that right I mean these people are scumbags in so many ways and there's some good people somebody what is the original Trump 2016 some of which I assume are very good people but but but anyways this is this is what crypto is all about right but I think crypto and I've been a part of the space for over a decade now guys guys and girls and I'll be PC about it but I've been in this space for over a decade now and crypto has in many ways become a circle jerk and everything it really has become a circle jerk part of my language they're just everybody going yeah yeah and some of this some of this stuff like I see the top 10% they build out truly amazing technologies I mean what is being done in the defy space unbelievable right but but ultimately we've forgotten what this has been made meant for which is to create an alternative financial system and not just to say that but to do that and I think that's that's that's it right and I think that is why I joined FGB I mean I have really good I like to think crypto creds and everything and obviously I'm a conservative a lot of crypto people pretend not to be conservative they pretend bow I'm just libertarian this you know and all that I don't know libertarians but you know they hide it and I came out as a quote unquote came out as very conservative and because I think it has to be done again like I said I keep repeating this but we have the ability the power the potential to get to 75 million plus people that voted for Trump and be able to get them to actually be a part of not just you know something you know normal coin this normal coin people looking at coin market cap but actually something that people use I mean it's just it's just incredible definitely

[Speaker 2]
definitely definitely somebody else said with a lot of reactions to it too which we we harped on it before but the key to long-term success as you're discussing is ease of use aside from listening on other centralized exchanges what else can be done to make this easier to purchase and essentially it's going to be tuned in to Monday correct there

[Speaker 1]
Monday like today I just and all of you guys know the vision and everything right but I mean I just kind of want to set the tone that you know from today on and I don't think this has ever been the case but I'm officially like planting a flag in the ground this this this is not a mean coin maybe you mean but it's not a mean coin this this is meant to honestly be a flex of power I mean I think I mean you know that's what we want to do is we want to flex power and actually flex true effective change in this country and someone asked is the plan the world or is the plan this country you know everything's always the world but reality is this country you know obviously with this ever we want people around the world to use this but honestly for the next five years if not longer it's gonna be America you know home of the brave because this is where they're put persecuting conservatives probably more than a actually no I mean look at Canada you look at Australia actually maybe we should start there honestly but I mean I just think that I think in the u.s. is a really good place to start obviously make it available where anyone can do it in the world but the United States is I think where we're gonna push this absolutely and

[Speaker 2]
yeah I'm looking through the rest of these questions I I think that this has been awesome I think it's really hit on the head of what we're talking about and and tonight and today some of the most important things are this is not a meme coin yes it may be a meme like you said but it's not a meme coin and you made that very apparent and very clear and the steps that we're going to be taking and the focus and just the time and effort that we're putting into this this is not a meme token this is not one of those yes tokens that are coins that you might see on coin market cap like you said or BSC or pool coin and whatever it may be this is a legitimate thing with with tremendous people behind it and that's been that's the focus of tonight is to show that and every single week we're going to be showing you guys something new bringing something new to the table and getting you guys more and more excited about the future of

[Speaker 1]
this coin so you know that's that's the problem it's just I only have like one plug in this place out the booty so I that's basically my problem but next I'm gonna call in for my freedom phone and everything because my laptop and phone are just just out of charge right now but that's as long as the connection

[Speaker 2]
is good I don't mind answering more questions I know I need a freedom phone

[Speaker 1]
too I got to get that thing going exactly exactly I mean that's good in it I mean it's also a discord thing like I'm on my iPad this this is clear right I mean I can hear you perfectly so actually do does anyone want to do some verbal questions can we like add people in the chat you know like verbally yeah

[Speaker 2]
let's say if you if you have a question and you shoot up here in the discord and like raise your hand and I'll add you up here like we we used to do Eric a quick background on the coin this is like I said over 80 days old we used to do I would be on here every single night the first 62 days I had 59 of those days I would do a live voice session every single night and I would do Q&A's I would have people up here ask questions we would just talk just chit-chat random things just to keep everybody excited keep everybody going so if anybody has any questions please please please raise your hand in the general chat and if you want to talk up on up here don't be shy we will not bite this is hand raising disabled all that that puts us in a pickle it's not a sandwich I had three hot dogs today just so they know well so that where that comes from is like back in the day I said that we were gonna think I think I said we're gonna like release news or something like that it's like week two or week three and if we don't do it by this date I'll eat ten hot dogs in five minutes and we did it so I video chatted there it is the picture I ate ten hot dogs in five minutes and everybody loved it if you want to speak I see it

[Speaker 1]
drew a lot of Australians okay perfect you just missed out but I really love Sebastian Kurz of Austria they the establishment took him down over there I was very disappointed to see he was a big big Sebastian Kurz fan and

[Speaker 2]
everything oh you're up here now can hey I'm just trying to help you bring people up what's up Eric how you doing thanks for thanks for joining us we're glad to have you on board super excited to have you here it was a probably our first moderator in the discord he's been here since the beginning and he is been an awesome help so we're getting people up here to ask some questions I see Sierra golfs up here we have two other people that are that are up here

[Speaker 4]
so I'm playing them up here yeah we hear you loud and clear sweet so I've been here since about 500 holders and this was back before anybody could have really guessed how far this would go I I'm sorry you said God bless you so just being here from really early on it's been super exciting to see where this coin has gone and only about two months time I would have never thought it would have gone this far I basically just threw my money in as a fuck you to Joe Biden and let let it sit what I'm really curious what I'm really curious about is now that you have joined the project and you've kind of seen the community do you have any long-term plans or any long-term goals in mind like where do you see this coin and two months or six

[Speaker 1]
months or even a year from now I mean I see this I mean someone else like how do we get kind of people that don't normally know to get in on a crypto exchange into this you know let's see a 40 or 50 or something right and you don't know a lot of 45 year olds I can't get into it but you know making this easy I you know for people right that's my number one goal over the next two months in this project is is just to make this easy for people and make things clear for people and I think that's that's it and also taking a look at the the tokenomics I'm a little bit they'll probably be out for the two months but I mean that's that's that's basically it just making this easy and having utility in the next two months I mean genuinely I mean that's that's it nothing else nothing more nothing less and I think that's a lot oh definitely

[Speaker 4]
no that's perfect I've I've talked to a few of my own family members and friends about this a few times and I've told them about the coin and they seemed excited and then I told them the process to get the coin and all the sudden they

[Speaker 1]
were a lot less excited exactly well that's that's that's the whole next few months you'll see just leaks of improvement on that I mean you'll it'll be you'll be you'll literally you'll see leaves of improvement and in my opinion that improvement will put us honestly with the best of them you know with the best of these projects I mean genuinely I mean it's you'll see I mean that's the thing as you put some money in you know a because it's a it's a mean coin after Biden absolutely but I think you'll be surprised that that it's it's not just Biden it's this this is this is gonna be in my opinion one of the greatest technologies that will that honestly well I mean it's it's just like basically getting DeFi and crypto actually what it was meant to be I mean it really like the dream of Bitcoin back when I was like literally goddamn look 12 years old was like people are gonna start taking this in stores like people weren't thinking about the price you know obviously people you know people thought about the price later right but people weren't thinking that it was like let's get this I mean you would literally like Bitcoin faucets right like you could you would people would like give away free Bitcoin right I mean it was funny I think that's how I got like my first two Bitcoin was like it was like a Bitcoin faucet people just give me two free bitcoins and it was like you know a penny right you know I mean that was that was interesting or something like that right and then and then yeah I mean that's that's it but I just feel like we've lost a little bit of that like people are like Oh Bitcoin is it when you know it used to be people would ask me when is the like when is this Bitcoin gonna reach this critical mass where everybody in the country takes it that was the original questions that I was asked back when Bitcoin first came out obviously other than the normal like what the hell is it right and then that's and then now it's like when do you think it'll go to 100 grand when do you think it'll go to 100 grand when but and I get those questions right those things you know those are fun questions and and and I don't mind giving answers to them because I get where people are coming from right and it's a good good place where people are coming from right but that's that's I mean that's the whole thing with FTP is that the answer the question that were the answer to the question of you know when is this you know when is crypto gonna basically hit a viral moment in the United States where everybody's taking it as part of their their business or at least you know and and I think this is this is why taking a little bit of a political element to it is is good because you know like people go to say hey would you take this cryptocurrency because you know it's a great technology etc etc they go well I don't really understand crypto right but if we take this coin and we say look Flynn is getting got banned look Trump got banned from banks he could barely hold on to payment processing right now you know all these you know all these conservative companies getting banned not supported you know go take this because it's already happened to you or to take this because it's about to happen to you and honestly I kind of believe that and that type of marketing I don't say market but like marketing truth like your truth that you know a painful truth you know with an actual problem that we're solving I mean that's it right like Bitcoin doesn't solve I mean it per se solves a problem like it's I think it is a good digital cold if you will but but you know it's it's it's you know if shit really goes down or if you want to basically ride the highs and lows of Bitcoin that's the real use cases of Bitcoin right loved it and it's a great you know the trading pair right and I love Bitcoin you know it's how I've made my money love it to death it was the beginning that's the original baby of it all but I just think that's this is where I have JP you can have that truth and and and of solving a genuine problem for people and and us being very honest with that we are solving this problem and you know I don't think California is really gonna be taking it you know like a lot of businesses in California but I think in Texas I think in Florida I think in South Dakota I think in Idaho and actually you know maybe in California I mean you have six million people voted for Trump in California right I mean it's just you know there's more people voted for Trump in California than people voted and the entire population actually of Idaho which is you know not something people think a lot about right but anyways that's kind of a long answer to that

[Speaker 2]
