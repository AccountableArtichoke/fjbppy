(0:00 - 0:10)
The great Eric Finman tonight late night voice call. I know we got some we got a bunch of people in here already. Awesome.

(0:10 - 0:14)
Awesome. Awesome. Cannot be more excited to be up here.

(0:14 - 0:20)
We've been doing a lot more voices recently and I love it. I'm jacked up about it. I'm absolutely jacked up.

(0:20 - 0:34)
I know we got we got these people in here in here day in and day out. And I just wanted to give a quick shout out to Donnie to Rendog to F skull Mo. You guys have been killing it on StockTwits in the early morning crew.

(0:35 - 0:38)
I've gotten three accounts banned. My fourth account. Now we're pushing.

(0:39 - 0:41)
We're pushing. We're pushing. Pirates there.

(0:42 - 0:44)
These nuts is there. Everybody's there. It's awesome.

(0:44 - 0:50)
It's really a great time. We're trending on StockTwits on a day to day basis. Now we reached number two today behind Peloton.

(0:50 - 0:54)
Really incredible. Really, really incredible. I love it so much.

(0:54 - 0:59)
And for us to be here tonight. What day is today? Tuesday. Tuesday night.

(0:59 - 1:02)
February 8th. We have Eric Finman here. Live.

(1:02 - 1:03)
Live. Live. Live.

(1:03 - 1:08)
Wants to come up here. Wants to chitchat. Wants to talk about what's going on.

(1:08 - 1:12)
Our donations. Everything that's going on in the space of FJB. The app.

(1:13 - 1:20)
Whole nine yards. I just got him up here. What's going on, Eric? Can you hear me loud and clear? Can you hear me? I hear you loud and clear.

(1:21 - 1:28)
Hell yeah. For a second, I was like, I hope there's no technical difficulties, but I hear you now. Sounds good.

(1:28 - 1:35)
No, so glad to be on with everybody. And I appreciate everybody coming on, even though it's a bit late on the East Coast for people. Absolutely.

(1:36 - 1:44)
We couldn't be more happy to be here. I know you're always traveling. So where are you now? I'm in the West Coast area.

(1:44 - 1:52)
So that's where I'm at. And then I'll be in, I think, East Coast this weekend and jumping across there. It's always a journey.

(1:52 - 2:00)
Sick of planes, though. We need FJB to go up because I want to be able to get a jet one day. That would make it a lot easier.

(2:00 - 2:05)
That makes it easier. That makes it easier. So I hope that happens.

(2:07 - 2:16)
Absolutely. What's going on, though? We're really happy to have you here. A lot going on between the app, between the donations, between the Freedom Convoy.

(2:16 - 2:29)
There's so many different angles that we're hitting it at. And I feel like a lot of it kind of gets lost in the mix because we have so many things going on. Exactly.

(2:29 - 2:39)
The name change. Whole nine yards. So if you want to touch on some of the things that we've been doing, some of the things that FJB has been going on, and I guess some of the conversations that you've been having.

(2:40 - 2:52)
Absolutely. I mean, a thousand percent. I mean, you see with the truckers that this has been the most successful protest movement against the mandates and the restrictions and the lockdown that I think has ever seen.

(2:52 - 3:12)
Like Europe has done a lot of protests. But the truckers, I mean, that just goes to show that that can just shut down a whole country and a whole area. And I think it's really exciting and especially, I mean, and also horrible as it's exposing all of like what GoFundMe did, which just even proves the need for crypto more.

(3:12 - 3:19)
I mean, you see Tucker. He last night talked about this is why what GoFundMe did to the truckers. This is why we need crypto.

(3:20 - 3:40)
And it's so important. And now pretty much FJB is like the only main coin of the right. And this movement now with LGBT, you know, down the tubes, like, you know, I feel bad for the people that believed in that project and everything.

(3:40 - 3:50)
And, you know, it's never fun to see that. But genuinely, I mean, we are the main coin of the right. And this is and we're able to with a donation of 25 million tokens.

(3:50 - 4:00)
Imagine when the app comes out, what that'll mean for the truckers, because that that will because this movement isn't just going to be a few days. It's going to be weeks. It's going to be months.

(4:00 - 4:30)
It's you know, I think these people are afraid of it expanding, you know, not just to Canada, but to many other countries. People are talking about in the US, many countries in Europe. And it's crazy. 

And it's so good that FJB is at the forefront and got a lot of word around, you know, with the truckers that we're doing this for them. And again, it just shows the use case. I mean, people talk, you know, what's the utility of this or what's the utility of that? And, you know, this is the utility.

(4:30 - 4:36)
Look at what GoFundMe is. I mean, it's just horrible. And I think when we have the app, I mean, it's just going to be so exciting.

(4:36 - 4:56)
And me and Grant and others have been working our butts off, you know, making sure that that's going to be a massive success when it comes out. And I think that will be a whole turning point, a whole turning point for the future of this coin in the future of this project and the future of this movement genuinely. And and that's why I was like I like with the trucker stuff.

(4:56 - 5:17)
This is why I was like I told I'm always traveling. That's why I had to do it late. Right. 

I was like, Grant, let's let's just do it because we have to talk about the trucker stuff, even though it's not the best time. But I mean, it's just so, so important what we're doing. And to see Steve go on the podcast today on War Room and talk about this and how big this is, I think that's huge.

(5:18 - 5:41)
And I think, too, you know, him saying in or I think a paraphrasing, Kimberly Guilfoyle, the best is yet to come and that we have so much more to do. And to hear Steve say that again today has been such an amazing vote of confidence. And he has way more stuff, I think, in the pipeline or war room as way more stuff in the pipeline and for this project and especially when we have this app out.

(5:41 - 5:53)
I mean, I'm I'm pulling out all the stops, you know, for this app. I mean, I really am. I will I will spare no expense and no no favor I can call on for this app because I just think that'll be the changing point.

(5:53 - 6:07)
And, you know, still working our butts off and making sure that things are success and people believe and get more involved in this project until then, which is like what we're doing today. One thousand percent. Yeah, you touched on a bunch of stuff there, and I think a lot of things did come up.

(6:07 - 6:41)
So to sort of start about the tokens that the 25 million, which is tremendous and a lot of people were reaching out there saying, well, why did you start why did you donate with with tokens and not U.S. dollars and so on and so forth? And you hit it right there. We are the coin of the right and we want to become that basically that donation piece as well, where we're helping out and push the movement that this Freedom Convoy is not going to go away. And because of that, you see like GoFundMe, how left and how crazy they are.

(6:41 - 6:58)
If that way down, like it's so absurd. So the fact that FJB is there to step up to the plate, step up to the bat, raise tokens, raise awareness and really push out the word and say, like, this is what's going on in this world since Biden took over. That's the reason why we did tokens.

(6:58 - 7:15)
It's really, really, really awesome. And you touched on a bunch of stuff exactly about Steve Bannon and War Room. That is the best arsenal that we have, because Steve Bannon is one of the most influential people in the country.

(7:15 - 7:29)
He really is. And even the world. And for him to be going there and still being so passionate, so enthusiastic about FJB, he really does care about this coin so much.

(7:29 - 7:37)
Like he on it every single day is saying, what's going on? What are we doing? I'm doing this. I'm doing that. He's working tirelessly behind the scenes.

(7:37 - 7:47)
And we have a tremendous team. And then getting into the app, we are all working our butts off to make sure that this thing is perfect. This is a 24-7 thing, no matter what.

(7:47 - 8:01)
We are on countless Zoom calls, countless phone calls, getting everything squared away, because we know how crucial and how important this thing is. And it's groundbreaking. And this is the exact thing that we need.

(8:01 - 8:09)
And we're getting it done. I can assure you that there's no better group of people to get this thing done. Thousand percent.

(8:10 - 8:18)
I just, I honestly, I love the team. You know, I think we have one of the best teams in the world. And that's why I wanted to become an advisor into this project, because it's just, it's an exciting team.

(8:18 - 8:23)
And the Discord chat is so fun. I love, I literally love this community. It's the best.

(8:25 - 8:42)
And, and it's just honestly, like the, the, the work on this app that's going, I know it's like today's Trucker Day, but, oh yeah, I actually saw someone said funding in the group chat, freedom, jobs, business, and truckers. So maybe we should be FJBT, you know, the token, but it actually stands for truckers. That's actually a pretty good idea.

(8:43 - 8:47)
Yeah. And also the name changed too. We haven't, we have the double meaning of the name.

(8:47 - 8:54)
We haven't even discussed that either. Yeah. So FJB obviously means fuck Joe Biden.

(8:55 - 9:10)
And then, and then now we're kind of making sure that we're, we're freedom jobs and for freedom, jobs and business as well, FJB as well. So a little bit of a double entendre there. But, but I mean, that's, that's what it is.

(9:10 - 9:21)
Cause once we have this app out, it's going to allow merchants to be able to take it. It's going to allow truckers to even individually accept the. The nations and everything, which is seeding this today is one.

(9:21 - 10:14)
Cause we support the cause, but two, you know, we want to get this app and this project in, in the minds of, of the truckers that are at the forefront of this movement, I'm really surprised that a lot of Republicans, you have like news media, like Fox me, you know, and then Newsmax, but a lot of Republican politicians, I don't feel like you're talking about the truckers enough because ultimately I think a lot of them are sold out establishment studios that, you know, that, that are afraid of that coming to the U.S. Um, but, um, but I, I, I just think that this is, this is literally the whole truckers is literally why this coin and this project was invented quite literally, you know, for these people, for this project and they're targeting conservatives and they're banning them. I mean, you know, people talk about, Oh, the unbanked and everything, you know, they're continuing to expand the level of the unbanked in this country with their targeting of conservatives. And that's what FGB is trying to solve.

(10:14 - 10:33)
I know I'm preaching to the choir on these discord chats, but I just feel like it's worth repeating how important this is and how big it is and why, you know, we, we donated 25 million tokens, which is what this is for. You know, this is what this tokenomics of this project is for is to be able to help those people. Absolutely.

(10:33 - 10:59)
And, and, and like you said, you're preaching to the choir, but it's so important, it's so important to have these conversations and that's, that's one of the best parts about this community too, is you have really important conversations that, that need to be spoken about. And what seems like common sense to us is so everybody needs to know it. And it's, it's so crazy listening to the news sometimes the left wing media and just kind of seeing the way the world is.

(10:59 - 11:15)
And I know that everybody in here is pretty like-minded and we just get mind blown by, by what reality is sometimes. And, and example, the truckers and how they're just getting kind of kicked to the curb and that's where FJB comes in. That's where we step up to the plate.

(11:16 - 11:36)
That's where we donate. That's where we help out. And we're at the forefront of this whole movement where we're standing basically locked arms with, with a lot of these true patriots supporting the great truckers, even if it's not from America, even if it's in Canada, because injustice is injustice and like we said, FJB is freedom, jobs, and business.

(11:37 - 11:47)
And most importantly is freedom and freedom in the world. Exactly. A hundred percent, a hundred percent.

(11:47 - 11:58)
We have one question. It was about the tokenomics, everything. We're going to talk about that on a later, I don't know if we're taking questions now, but I just, it's just, I, I am watching the chat, but someone asked a question on tokenomics.

(11:58 - 12:13)
We're going to talk about that in a future voice call. I know we said that before, but I think we, we have some, some, we've been working our butts off on the app and everything, but I think we'll have exciting stuff on the tokenomics stuff ahead. And then, and then someone else actually about updates on the app.

(12:13 - 12:29)
Um, yeah, I'd say we're still on track for March, you know, obviously it's not stutter's law. If you want to Google what that is, but I'd say we're still on track for March, um, and everything. But, but yeah, I mean, again, just, I, I so appreciate what you, what you just said, Grant, because it's true.

(12:30 - 12:35)
It's literally true. Um, and, oh, I saw someone just bought a freedom phone in the chat. That's that's nice.

(12:35 - 12:37)
Thank you. Thank you. Oh yeah.

(12:37 - 12:40)
That's Chicago. Jacob's been here for a long time. So freedom phones.

(12:40 - 12:47)
I I'm excited to get mine too. Uh, this is, it's, it's a movement. It's like freedom.

(12:47 - 12:57)
Freedom is, is really so apparent. And, uh, those phones are incredible. And I've, I've seen what the left wing media does to say, oh, it does this.

(12:57 - 13:07)
Does that I've seen resounding, resounding, resounding thumbs up across the board about the freedom phone. Totally. Absolutely.

(13:07 - 13:27)
This isn't a freedom, but it's, um, I'm glad, I'm glad that people are getting one and, and, and like it, but this isn't not a, not a, not a chat for that, but I can, I can answer questions separately on that. But, um, but no, I mean, I honestly, we should get these phones. Oh, we lost you for a second with the app on there.

(13:27 - 13:38)
Um, that'd be fun. Uh, I mean, I, I just, I just feel so good. Anyways, just, I guess in conclusion, maybe we'll move on to the question thing, but in conclusion on that, I just feel so good about what we've done on the truckers.

(13:38 - 13:44)
I think you saw Jack Pasobic talked about it again today. Uh, uh, Bannon talked about it. You know, I talked about it.

(13:44 - 13:53)
The incredible community have talked about it. You've had truck. Oh, can you not hear me? Um, uh, I'm always in the middle of nowhere, so it's always a problem.

(13:54 - 13:56)
Um, okay. Awesome. Awesome.

(13:56 - 14:13)
Awesome. But with what Pasobic has talked about today, what Bannon has talked about today, what we talked about today, what I talked about today, I mean, I think it's just absolutely incredible. And you see, you've had, uh, some of the, one of the trucker freedom convoy, Instagram pages, you know, they shouted us out, you know, it, it's incredible.

(14:13 - 14:25)
And I'm, I'm glad that I'm part of a project like FJB that is there basically on the, on virtually maybe on the ground, um, helping these people. And it's, it's just amazing. And I would feel so good as a community member of this project.

(14:25 - 14:38)
And, and it's, it's amazing that we have like, you know, 135 people as of now, you know, listening to us, even though it's a little bit late on the East coast, so I appreciate that, but I'm done to move on to questions. If you are Grant. A thousand percent.

(14:38 - 14:42)
Yeah. I got one right here from, from Twan. Twan's been a long time member as well.

(14:42 - 14:59)
Uh, it says, what are the chances that we can have a tab in the app for cash donations to bury go fund me once and for all. And I know that we have a lot of features that we've been discussing for the app. So if you wanted to get into at least give a, maybe a quick insight as to what we can expect and what your vision is for that.

(15:01 - 15:31)
And in the first, in the first iteration of the app, I, it's going to be mainly used to be able to, um, uh, get into the project, um, in a super easy way, um, to be able to send and receive it. Uh, and then also for merchants to be able to use it, um, that, that is basically the first iteration of the app, but I, that's exactly doing kind of a Patriot crypto base go fund me super easily from the app. I think that's absolutely a no brainer future feature, not the next future feature after that.

(15:31 - 15:49)
So, I mean, that's just a no brainer thing to do. And that's something that I think I've wanted to do. Um, as a part of it, but we're just focused on making sure it gets out and does what it does simply and well and getting out, you know, in short order is, is basically the goal, but that's no, no doubt a future feature.

(15:52 - 16:01)
Um, I'm still reading. Let's see what else we got. I'm seeing if anybody has any questions, please shoot them in the chat.

(16:02 - 16:28)
Oh, somebody said merchants question mark, which is, uh, definitely a huge aspect as to what we want to do with that, that business aspect of freedom, jobs, and businesses we would love for mom and pop places and, and either big, not rather big or small, it doesn't matter, uh, whatever company or small business, uh, wants to take FJB. We would love to. And I know, I know like one of the first times I had a conversation with Eric.

(16:28 - 16:57)
Uh, he said, we want like the Verizon map essentially, uh, with FJB where it's like FJB is taken in this city, that city, that city. And then before you know it, the whole entire country's filled up with those red dots, because that's what this country really is. If you remember when Trump won in 2016, I think Hillary Clinton only won 52 counties, like actually 52 counties and Trump won like 2,100 counties and the whole entire country was red.

(16:58 - 17:06)
It really was. And that's what this map is going to look like as well, uh, in the future. Right, Eric? Exactly.

(17:06 - 17:27)
A thousand percent, you know, it's like, like, like you said, it's going to be like the Verizon map of, of where the coverage is, you know, um, with the Tesla supercharging map across the United States, you know, in the world, you know, that's, that's absolutely it. And I, I'm excited to be able to show that map once we have that app out, cause I think it'll be a big map very quickly. Absolutely agree.

(17:27 - 17:38)
You see, you see any other questions here? People are, uh, let's see. Let's take, uh, maybe two or three more questions. Yeah, perfect.

(17:38 - 17:43)
I think, I think that'd be perfect. Two or three more questions. So just tag me, tag, tag Finn.

(17:45 - 18:00)
Yeah, I'm reading, I'm reading. I'm trying to catch up. I'm, I'm a little bit behind.

(18:01 - 18:34)
I think there's some questions in here too, that we, we just can't answer yet in terms of, um, yeah, that's what, that's exactly what I think it's good. No, I liked it. Someone asked me, what is my feedback for my crypto buddy? But they're back insane positive feedback.

(18:34 - 18:45)
I mean, I think, uh, and especially I gave them a little window into what we're planning for the future and they'd like that even more. Um, so that's been, that's been really good. Let's see.

(18:45 - 18:55)
That will require to be assured my information is kept safely knowing the left-leaning malicious actors being full force against us. So we will answer that question. Although I just kind of mumbled it out.

(18:55 - 19:22)
Um, that's a very good question. Um, we're going to publish, I think a whole security kind of document based on this app and put on a website so that we know, you know, what's going on and what's safe, and that's something I've done in past projects, um, before, um, so that, that way you'll know, and you can read it and, uh, and make sure that everything will be good. Uh, the, the fees keeps asking when, when hug, I think he just wants a hug.

(19:23 - 19:31)
Here we go. We'll give you a virtual, give you a massive virtual hug right now. It is fees.

(19:31 - 19:52)
You got your wish. Um, since the app apple require KYC, how can I be assured information is kept safe, especially knowing the left-leaning malicious actors? Yeah, that's what I just answered. So that would, that will be a, that will be, we'll put out a whole security, um, uh, post blog post slash report.

(19:52 - 20:00)
I would say, um, when that is out, that's something I've done before in past projects. So that's, that's absolutely needed. So you can read that and then I think you'll feel safe after you read it.

(20:01 - 20:32)
Um, great. So someone said, what is the marketing? What kind of big marketing camp, Pam, what, what kind of big marketing will come with the app will break the world? I think it'll absolutely break past the war room audience. And I think, uh, that the war, the rest of the war room audience that may be struggles to understand crypto, I think then you'll get even a triple double, you know, um, interest, um, uh, emotional interest of, of people in the app or interested in the project because of the app.

(20:32 - 20:51)
So I think it'll absolutely break past the war room audience. And two, I think you'll actually get the true, um, fruits of the war room audience by making it easy to use. Someone said, uh, here, let's do a final question.

(20:51 - 21:05)
Does that sound good? Perfect. You want to pick? Yeah, I'm looking, I'm, I'm, I've been scrolling. I'm checking other channels too, cause I know people have been sending, uh, sending questions in a bunch, basically like, Hey, I can't come tonight.

(21:05 - 21:24)
So the next time we'll, I'll, I'll gather a list too beforehand so we can rattle them off. Um, to, to, to out of excitement, which is awesome. Um, we, uh, we need one more, one more good question.

(21:24 - 21:42)
One more, one more solid one. Is this the one, but are they a little bit one? Grant, I'll let you pick this last question. I see some silly ones.

(21:46 - 21:54)
Maybe we lost you for a second. Someone said, are you single? Maybe that could be. They asked if you're a single.

(21:55 - 22:00)
Yeah, they said no. They want, they want hugs. They want everything.

(22:01 - 22:22)
I'm madly in love with this project. This is, this is my, this is my, uh, this is my new wife. Uh, will the app act as a wallet for other crypto? So that, how about we, uh, take that last question? Will the app act as a wallet for the crypto? Absolutely.

(22:22 - 22:32)
Yes. There's going to be other crypto currencies in there, but obviously with FJB as the favorite and as the top, and I'll tie in another question. I'll do a double question as the last one.

(22:32 - 22:47)
Someone said, are, you know, younger users waiting for that? Actually, I would say older users are waiting for the app. And, and that's, and when we have that, we'll be able to even do more stuff with truckers like we did today. That's so big, treated out that band and tweeted out that I tweeted out at so many others in the freedom.

(22:49 - 23:09)
Instagram convoy, you know, talked about, you know, that's that, that app is going to just be wild. It's going to be a wild day in the discord at that point. And we're going to have, I might have a multi hour long voice chat, you know, just going on about that when that app is out and, and we're going to be doing interviews, we're going to be doing, it's just going to go.

(23:09 - 23:18)
Blow past. I think anything that people have seen on this project, I really do. You know, in my opinion, I mean, I just so believe in that.

(23:18 - 23:30)
And I hope all of you guys believe in this too, and, and believe in this app. Cause that's, that's basically what I'm heads down. That's my goal is the advisor here is I'm, I'm just, I just, I just, that's my main focus above all else.

(23:30 - 23:42)
And I hope you guys understand that and love that. And because it's, it's, it's just, it's going to be something. And again, I know you've been a lot of crypto projects, a lot of projects and they go, Oh, it's going to be great.

(23:42 - 24:08)
The future is going to be great, but genuinely, I mean, I've, I got into crypto and Bitcoin when I was 11 years old, 11, 12 years old, and I have not been more excited about a project. Uh, since Bitcoin, basically when I first heard about it back in 2011, uh, then FJB, I have not been this excited since I first discovered Bitcoin than I did with FJB. And I'm not just saying that I really mean that otherwise I wouldn't have stuck my name to this project.

(24:08 - 24:15)
So thank you for believing this app. Someone commented, I believe in the app and I believe in the moment in this movement. Thank you.

(24:16 - 24:33)
I believe in the app. I know you guys believe in the app and I just want to thank you all for just being a part of this project and being part of this rollercoaster that, that is, you know, doing something, something and changing the world. And that's why we, we, we have both fuck Joe Biden and freedom jobs.

(24:33 - 25:01)
We both have that revolutionary sentiment and that we're serious about giving people freedom about enabling and growing more jobs in this country and helping businesses and, uh, all across the country get free from these big tech, uh, banks, but anyways, thank you so much. I know I've grand, do you want to finish out and say something, but I'm going to sign off. Right.

(25:02 - 25:12)
You are the man, uh, Finn, thank you for hopping up here. Uh, really every single time you come up here, it really excites the crowd. There is so much to be excited about.

(25:12 - 25:35)
And, and even more importantly, somebody asked, uh, are you basically waiting on the younger generation or the older generation to get into the coin when we get the app? We're waiting on every generation. I think we haven't even tapped 99% of the people that are going to buy this coin. And I really, really believe that the people that are going to get this coin, uh, 99%, we haven't even tapped.

(25:35 - 25:51)
And if you, if you think that we're already at probably over 10,000 holders on and off chain, it's only 1%. That's my two cents. Once the app comes out, like I keep saying, it's going to be easier than buying toilet paper on Amazon.

(25:52 - 25:59)
I'm so tremendously excited. I could, I I've never lost my excitement. My day one energy is there every single day.

(25:59 - 26:07)
We're working on our absolute butts off. We're going to continue to do these voice calls. Thank you everyone for being here and for all the great questions and the fun.

(26:07 - 26:12)
Keep pushing. Let's keep being forced multipliers. Let's keep the foot on the gas.

(26:12 - 26:14)
Everybody have a great night.
