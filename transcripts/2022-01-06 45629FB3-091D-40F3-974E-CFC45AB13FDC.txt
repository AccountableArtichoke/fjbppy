[Speaker 3]
I'm up here as the FJP founder.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, you're all set.

[Speaker 3]
I muted myself too, so they can't hear me either. We're all set, so Boris is going to request to speak too. I'm thinking how I do it is I just give the brief overview, introduce you guys, and then let you guys speak.

Awesome. All right, sounds good.

[Speaker 5]
Bye. Cool. Bye.

[Speaker 3]
What's going on?

[Speaker 5]
Bro, we can't hear you.

[Speaker 3]
I know. I just told them to mute him.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, cool. We can't hear you the whole time.

[Speaker 3]
I know. I know.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. All right. We're good.

Bye. Bye.

[Speaker 4]
Hello, everybody. Can you guys all hear me?

[Speaker 3]
All right. I'm seeing. Boris, how are you?

You can hear me loud and clear? I can hear you loud and clear. I hear you loud and clear, my friend.

That is awesome. We're all set. Sounds like we're all set over there as well.

Awesome. Well, welcome, everybody. We have currently over 350 people and counting.

Still going up. Still going up. Like I said, today is January 6th.

Very exciting day. We have the legendary Stephen K. Bannon and Boris Epstein here.

Just shot up there. Here to speak to you guys, to speak to the community about the FJB coin, about all of the exciting things that we have going on, about what's been going on, about what's coming in the future. I couldn't be more excited to be here.

Thank you guys so much for taking the time out of your busy schedules to come up here and speak to the community. I know it means a lot to so many people. People have been so absolutely excited about this.

Again, that number is going up 368 people so far, which is an absolute record for our voice sessions that we've had. But welcome, guys.

[Speaker 4]
Thanks so much. Of course. How's everything going today?

[Speaker 1]
It's going great. We just got out of the war room. I had a record audience today.

And we lit them up. We had Gates in the first hour. And Julie Kelly in the second hour to get to the bottom of the investigation they're doing on the FBI and the National Security State about their involvement in 6th January.

So, no, we're firing on all cylinders.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely. I was telling you.

[Speaker 2]
Grant, excited to be here, excited to be with the community. I've been in the chats talking to all of you. Thanks for the support.

We're very, very, very enthusiastic about growing this movement, growing the coin, and bringing so much utility to it and really making it the place where you both have your voice heard, have your primal discontent with the current illegitimate administration heard, and making it the true currency for the MAGA movement, the deinflationary currency for the MAGA movement.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely. I think you touch on a lot of great points right there. And one of them is building and developing that groundbreaking media utility for a cryptocurrency that is, like I said, groundbreaking.

And it's the first of its kind for this type of coin that's deflationary, a coin that you said is like a primal scream. FJB is a deep-rooted acronym that we all are very prideful. That's why we're here.

That's why we are all together at 12.15 p.m. Eastern on a Thursday, all here listening, because we are all on the same team. We all have the same cause, and we all have that same belief of getting this country back to what it was.

[Speaker 2]
No doubt about it. Steve, do you want to talk a little bit about your reasoning for, our reasoning for joining this partnership and where we see it going in the future?

[Speaker 1]
And this is why I wanted to do it on 6 January. You know, the country's at an inflection point. We're going to be, and that's what we call on the War Room, I think, New Year's Day special, I call this the Valley of Decision.

It's not simply this election that's coming up in November, which obviously is going to be monumental. It's more important that we're in the middle of a fourth turning. This is actually the fourth turning in American history, from the Revolution to the Civil War, Great Depression, World War II, and now today.

And depending on the road we take, is it going to be the constitutional republic that's been bequeathed to us for 12 or 13 generations, or is it going to be something radically different? And divine providence, and in the 2016 election, which obviously divine providence, with Donald J. Trump, who's a provident figure, with all his imperfections, it was actually at work on 3 November, and other places, in that we got full exposure of what this true Marxist, totalitarian, globalist apparatus will do to American citizens.

We've seen it in all its glory. It can't be hidden from view. It's out there in plain sight.

So there's a number of initiatives. You know, I've kind of dedicated my life to the last, I don't know, 10 years or so, since I started making film, and then I partnered with Andrew Breitbart, before he passed away, kind of dedicated my life to this populist, nationalist, sovereignist, traditionalist movement, not just here in the United States, but throughout the world. And there come certain points in time, and you have to get, you have to expand out of the weapons you're going to use.

I've been very involved in digital currencies. A lot of you guys realize I was the CEO of a company, years ago, in the masterly multiplayer game space, that was in the gold business, consolidation of the gold business, and really consolidating all the information websites. We kind of became Bloomberg, World of Warcraft sites.

That was all out of Asia, and many years investing in companies in Asia, and investing in these companies that were in that. We saw the dawn of digital currencies. I've been involved as an investor in their inception, and I felt it was the right time to get involved in a digital currency, because, quite frankly, with this out-of-control regime that's currently running the United States, and its network of relationships, both Wall Street, to central banks, to the party of Davos, to the Communist Party, we're hurtling towards an economic and financial crisis.

We see it every day. And ever since the financial crisis in 2008, the central banks, Wall Street companies, the woke corporations, what they've done to put the burden on the American people for financing it by negative interest rates, zero interest rates, and quantitative easing to basically force fiat currency into the system to save the elites, and to create these asset bubbles in stocks, and create these asset bubbles in real estate.

It shows you they are forcing citizens and the American people into alternative currencies that can be used for two things. Number one, just to do transactions. Number two is potentially for alternative stores of value.

And so, in looking at this in a broader scope, FJB Coin, the reason I wanted to partner with, not just the management team, but it's also the name. My philosophy is quite simple right now. Fuck Joe Biden.

It's no, let's go, Brandon. It's fuck Joe Biden and everything he stands for. This is an illegitimate regime that has been forced onto the American people.

And we're going to be known 100, 200 years from now as the patriots that stood in the breach and said, hey, how about this? Suck my dick, okay? Fuck you, right?

We are not going to tolerate it. We're not going to stand for it, okay? We're going to color inside the line.

We're going to color boldly. And we're going to defeat you. And then once we defeat you, we're going to run you out of this town and not have to deal with you anymore.

And one of the central parts of that is to have an alternative currency. And that's why this currency is so important. You should understand what we're doing now.

We're not looking at this as some quick day trade, right? In fact, we're doing the exact opposite. What we're looking at is this is going to be a real currency that can be used for real transactions and ultimately an alternative store value to get you away from the devaluations that the American people are going on every day by the fiat currency, right?

What they've destroyed the US dollar and they're right now up here concocting more outrageous spending plans to destroy it even more and more central bank intervention to make sure the elites in this country through the assets and their stocks are taken care of while the American people and particularly people under 40 years old are nothing more than Russian serfs. Well, hey, I got a message to you. Go fuck yourself, okay?

So patriots have an alternative. And right now we're going to build this. You know, Boris and I 24 hours a day talking to people about using this currency as a means of transaction.

We're going to start having some announcements in the next couple of days and we're talking to major people. We're talking to all types of verticals, right? So this can actually be used for transactions and you're going to get discounts for using this, okay?

So we want to make sure that these things are done correctly, that they're done right and that we can deliver both for the retailer, for the products and for obviously the community. In addition, we're looking obviously about the traditional things you need. Market makers, exchanges, everything.

So people can get full access to this on an ongoing basis, actually see what they're currently doing and make sure they understand that this is a robust, liquid, deep capital market. So all the skills I've learned throughout my life as a naval officer at Harvard Business School, at Goldman Sachs, all my years as an entrepreneur and investor and now in kind of the realm of, I guess, media or politics. We're bringing every ounce of that.

It is absolutely essential, okay? For the survival of the sovereignty and the patriot movement that we actually have a currency that we can count on and not tricks like, oh, I would never go fucking spray paint or pay for millions of dollars and put it on some fucking hood of a fucking car, a NASCAR. Go fuck yourself.

I don't care about that. I care about reality. And here's the reality.

The reality is this is going to be the currency for fucking warriors. This is going to be the currency for people to say, hey, here's what our philosophy is. Fuck Joe Biden, right?

And in that, it means we reject everything that you stand for and we're going to build a community here and we're going to have our own currency. And that currency is going to be, is going to be something that has value. It's something that's going to be able to be used.

And you should know that we've got other things we're working on. We've got credit cards we're working on, financial services. We're never going to allow, because here's the anniversary that's important.

It's not 6th January and this phony Biden up there trying to tie this to the honored dead of Pearl Harbor, to try to tie this to the honored dead of 9-11. Hey, here's what he can do. Go fuck himself, okay?

You're going to disgrace the honored dead of Pearl Harbor, the US Arizona. They're still at the bottom of Pearl Harbor. You're going to disgrace the honored dead of 9-11.

Many of Susan's ashes are still there in the ground and tie it to what happened. A FBI driven operation, as is now becoming clear every day on 6th January. The important date, the important anniversary is Saturday, the 8th of January.

That's when Twitter kicked off Donald J. Trump, who was then a sitting president of the United States, the commander in chief of our armed forces. So never going to allow, we're building out networks now to never allow you to get kicked off social media, to never let you be debanked, to never let them have the ability to take your livelihood away or to take your financial resources away or to make you even more of a Russian surf than they've already made you.

So the first step of freedom is to have our currency and we're going to make this a currency. We're putting our shoulder to the wheel and we're bringing in smart, tough people to do it. So that's one of the things that I will commit to you that, and I think I've got a pretty good track record of not just saying, hey, this is important, this is where we spend our time, but putting our shoulder to the wheel and not backing down at all.

So I'm very honored that the management team reached out to us and that we got involved and I'm very thankful Boris is here to put his shoulder to the wheel. So I'll turn it over to you. I'm running a little hot and the reason is I want to do it today on this day to make sure we can address the community about how important the community is and how important our joint effort and journey going forward.

[Speaker 2]
Steve, that was awesome. Thank you so much. I'm so honored and proud to be working with you on this, on other projects and so proud to be a member of the War Room Posse of the MAGA movement, which you're an unquestionable leader in under the leadership of President Trump.

As we move forward and we get to the bottom of the 2020 election, we push back on the illegitimate Biden regime. We fight against the tyranny of the left, tyranny of big tech, tyranny of big finance, of Wall Street, and we take our country back in November 2022 and then November 24. As far as this project is concerned, we are all in, as Steve said, 24 hours a day and we are driving to make FJB a top 50 cryptocurrency project in the world.

No doubt about it. We're going to build and develop a groundbreaking blockchain media utility. So there's going to be media information, videos, et cetera, that's available just to FJB community and we're going to build this out as the cryptocurrency, as the currency for the MAGA movement.

Major retailers, names you know, major outlets are going to be taking, we're working to have them take the FJB coin as currency as the dollar continues to be devalued, as the dollar continues to be absolutely destroyed by this illegitimate regime. That's what we're building out, this currency. And a key goal we have for 2022 is to build a payment gateway because obviously in order for these major outlets, these major retailers to take FJB to make this the cryptocurrency for the MAGA movement, we need, absolutely need and require to have that payment gateway to be in place.

And this is going to be all over. It's going to be coffee shops, restaurants, mom and pops, everything from the major retailers, which names you know, to the stores that are in your community. And we're going to provide signs for people where they're going to make a statement, FJB accepted here.

So we've got a lot of information coming, a lot of news coming. We hear you. We know that you want, you want this utility built out as soon as possible, as quickly as possible.

But let's remember, we've only been on board for about two weeks or so, and we are working tirelessly, tirelessly to build out the utility, build out the payment gateway, build out the relations with the retailers, both large and community, and make this the true, both statement, primal cry on how disgusting, this feckless, offensive, oppressive regime is, and make this a cryptocurrency for the MAGA movement.

Grant, I know we only have a couple, you had put out some questions that want to be asked from the community. If you want to ask those, see if I can answer real quick, and then we'll all move on and keep crushing this day.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely. Yeah, thank you guys so much. That was incredible.

Yeah, I sent out a form to our community a couple hours ago, asking if you guys had any questions, and I just picked a couple that I thought were fantastic. You hit on a couple, Boris and Steve, already, but one of them is, what can the average person do to get our duly elected president back? What can they do, just a normal American, to get this country back?

[Speaker 1]
The first thing you gotta do is just get engaged at every level. Look, what they fear the most is a true populist uprising at the local level. Remember, we're going to build this American revolution around a hyper-local political strategy, and build it up village by village.

What you can do is, number one, immerse yourself in all this information, and this doesn't cost you any money. Immerse yourself in these new sources and become a force multiplier. Push that information out, not just to your colleagues and comrades, but also people that disagree with you.

If you keep hitting them with information, you're gonna be shocked to see how all of a sudden people are saying, you know what, that's totally different from what I'm hearing, but let me hear more. This is why independents are now, Biden's approval among independents is 29%. 50% of independent voters, which is a proxy for the American people, now think he's illegitimate.

So number one, immerse yourself in what's going on and become a force multiplier. Number two, use your agency. What I mean by that is, join a precinct committeeman at the Republican Party.

It's free, but it empowers you. It makes you an owner, not just a donor to the Republican Party. Number two, back the people that are going to school boards.

Back the people that are going to become an election officials. Volunteer to become a poll watcher, right? Get inside the room.

You can become a player without ever having to write a check, okay? So that's number one. Number two, get very focused.

We've won more elections than we've lost since 1968. It's not simply about winning elections, it's about winning elections with the right people and the right policies. Put your shoulder to the wheel to help the Matt Gaetz's, the Marjorie Taylor Greene's, the people you see on War Room, the people in this community for this coming November, okay?

So we have a sweeping, you know, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100 seat sweep of the house, like in 1932. And through the House of Representatives, take control of the country back, right? For right now, you guys are this...

And that's why they hate War Room. That's why they hate me. That's why they're on Boris.

Remember, President Trump put you in the room in 16. Now you're putting yourself in the room, okay? And if you're not in the room, you're not in the deal.

This is the most corrupt city. This makes Rome look like a kindergarten, right? This is the most corrupt city on the face of the earth.

And the reason is, there's so much cash here. Remember, every year, the federal budget is $5.25 trillion. That's just the face amount of what the US government spends.

Think about a private equity fund. Think about a venture capital fund that had $5.25 trillion spent through it, right? That's why of the seven wealthiest counties in the United States, five of them surround Washington, D.C. The three in Northern Virginia, right across the river, then the county with Bethesda in it, and then the county, Prince George's County on the Maryland side, okay? The reason is, this city's awash with cash. It's the reason you need an alternative currency. It's the reason you need crypto.

Because they're gonna keep the machines running, the machines, and that's all on your back. So the way that you do it is, let's continue to hammer to get to the bottom of it. And I say 3 November.

Boris is gonna be on the show that works through November. 3 November, and the investigation is as live as it's ever been, in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, and in Arizona, those four states specifically, Michigan somewhat. But those four states, it's actually running pretty hot.

One thing I will guarantee you, we are not gonna sleep until we get the electors decertified from those states, the electors decertified from those states, and then we're gonna let this regime deal with it. But no, you can get involved right now. The best thing you can get involved is, look around your community.

Immerse yourself with data. Immerse yourself with information. Become a force multiplier about 24 hours a day, pushing it out on social media sites.

I happen to be on Getter because it's the one that I find, it's also the one that's got anti-CCP focus. But there are other ones out there, but Getter is a great way to have a community, a great way to spread information. So become a force multiplier and use your agency to get active.

This is not about, Donald Trump's not gonna save you, Steve Bannon's not gonna save you, Tucker Carlson, Rush Limbaugh, you're going to save the country. And that's what the community is about. That's why when the management team talked to us, I wanted to become a part of this because we definitely are in a need, alternative currencies going forward.

This is gonna be the, we're gonna build a community around here, around fighters. This is no, let's go Brandon. This is, hey, fuck Joe Biden, right?

The attitude of this is complete fight, complete warrior, no back down, go fuck yourself. We're saving our country and we don't want to hear your bullshit.

[Speaker 2]
Said, not much to add from my angle, the one and only Steve Bannon laid it out. And as Steve said, I'm gonna be on the show today on War Room at six o'clock Eastern, walking through three November and to the posse, to the movement, to this community, what you could do is make yourselves be heard, take agency into your own hands. We always say color within the lines, but color boldly, take agency into your own hands.

And frankly, part of the reason that we are, we are partners with this coin is because of that agency, is because of this, is because of what this community, what this movement stands for. And it is taking that agent, taking that power into your own hands and having yourself be heard by becoming a member of the FJB community, having access and being a part of the media blockchain. And then of course, using this as a currency, as we build it out.

That is what we're doing. That's why, you know, when that other pathetic coin, you know, the let's go bread and they want to mess around, they want to have cute little jokes. We want no part of that.

We are in your face. We are 24 seven. We are FJB, fuck Joe Biden.

That's what we are. That's what this is. That's what this movement is.

Joe Biden wants to go and lie to the American people today on January 6th and disrespect, as Steve said, our honored dead, disrespect the victims of 9-11, disrespect our men and women of first responders, men and women of the military. Well, you know what? Fuck him because we are here to stand up.

We're here to be strong. We're here to fight back. And this coin, this movement is a huge part.

[Speaker 1]
Remember, any movement in history, it started with a small core group that were relentless and would not back down. That's what this community is. This is the vanguard of this overall movement in the country.

We're not going to back down one fucking inch. We're tired of it. We see what they're trying to do with our country, whether it's the invasion of the southern border, the destruction of our currency, turning people more into Russian serfs, putting cultural Marxism from our kindergartens all the way through our military.

Hey, we've got a response to this. Go fuck yourself. We're not going to stand for it.

We're going to fight back. And guess what? You're not going to defeat us.

[Speaker 3]
That was incredible. Thank you guys so much. And like I said, today is a busy day for you guys.

We can't thank you enough for being here. This has been tremendous. This has been really awesome.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, Grant, before we jump, why don't you ask one more question because I know the community really wanted to put a lot of effort into it. I want to thank them by answering one more question. Go ahead, Grant.

[Speaker 3]
Definitely. Yeah. So another one that we saw is you kind of hit on it before Boris talking about the gateway payment, but what is one milestone you'd like to see FJB achieve before the end of 2022?

[Speaker 2]
Steve, I'll kind of jump in first real quick. No doubt about it. It is for FJB to be the currency of the MAGA movement, to be accepted by major retailers that you know, to be accepted by mom and pop shops, to be accepted all across the country and to be a statement, to be a statement in the American economy of we are standing for America.

We're standing for our strength and we're taking agency into our hands and FJB, that's the milestone that I'm seeing that I'm confident we'll achieve in 2022. Steve?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no, it's to make this a real currency, make it used on two things, transactions with real retailers and people that you use as a currency and it's the currency of this, not just this community, but this movement. And in addition, it's a store of value. Look, every day, what they're trying to do is take away your liberty, take away your freedom and they're doing it through legal methods or using lawfare, trying to use, you know, they're trying to steal elections, trying to do things in the dark of night.

They're allowing our Southern border to be invaded. Most importantly, financially, they're trying to destroy your financial security because they always want you a little nervous, right? This is the old five strategies from the way that the Imperial House in China used to run.

Keep them too busy, too occupied. There's a story out today, there's a poll, it was on Yahoo, and I forget who the polling firm was, that six times a day, the millennial, six times a day, the millennial generation has a thought about their concern and their worry about their financial position in the world. Think about that.

That's what many times people think about sex. They're worried about different, why in the most powerful nation in the history of the earth and what the deplorables and what MAGA and what MAGA for 12 fucking generations have done to make this the most powerful nation on earth. Why should any American citizen and particularly any millennial ever have any thought about financial worry?

You know why? Because the apparatus takes care of the apparatus and they tell you to go fuck yourself. Well, guess what?

This coin is going to be at the vanguard to turn the tables on and say, hey, how about this? You go fuck yourself, okay? So our goal at the end of 2022 is to make this a real currency.

We're not in this for the short term. And Boris is laboring 24 hours a day and this guy's a horse. So it is to make it a currency that's used for transactions, to make it a currency that's got to store value and to make it a currency that is the currency for the MAGA movement.

And I just want to end with one thing. What Napoleon told his marshals, when you set out to take Vienna, take Vienna. My closing statement is, fuck Joe Biden.

[Speaker 3]
Again, thank you guys so much. That was awesome. That was absolutely incredible.

We are so beyond excited to have you guys a part of this and leading the charge. Again, thank you guys. Thank you everybody for listening, for joining in.

We've got 500 people listening in today. I know that this thing is really going to be pushed out all socials, every single place that we have. This has been really incredible.

Thank you guys again. Any last words, Boris?

[Speaker 2]
My last words are God bless all of you. Stay strong. Don't back down.

Don't back up an inch. We've got this thing. We've got 100 seats, 100 years coming up in 2022.

We are going to take this country back and the fuck Joe Biden movement is a huge part of that. And the FJB coin is a vital part of that. So grow the community.

Have your voices be heard. Tell all your friends, let's grow this thing into the currency for the MAGA movement, which is exactly what it's going to be. Thank you all so much and God bless you.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you guys. Have a great day.
