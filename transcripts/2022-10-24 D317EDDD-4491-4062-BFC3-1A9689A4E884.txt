[Speaker 1]
And so, sorry about that. I don't, it's been a long time since I did Telegram, I think, way back when. Okay, so I just wanted to go over a few things.

I think I got five questions, if I'm not mistaken. Some of them actually overlapped, so we'll just have a few questions to answer today and some things that were going on in the general chat. I want to start off by saying thank you for your patience with FJB, with everything going on, everything that has gone on with me personally.

I do really want to stress the fact, and I've said this so many times before, but I need to stress it, that everything I do, I try to keep the coin's best interest in mind. So I know a lot of things, because I'm the messenger, that people might think I'm actually in charge of these decisions. And a lot of backlash I've seen against me, thinking that I'm in charge of this.

I appreciate you thinking I have that much power, but I do not, not even close. So a lot of the things I know that we can't share, because there's all kinds of people in these rooms watching, and obviously conservative world is just a target, not considering then, more than that even, BNB being such a target right now. So whether that's legalities, or things not approved by Boris and Bannon, but I do not make decisions.

I am purely the messenger. So I'd really appreciate if everybody understands that, and gives me a little bit of grace for that. Just because I promise you, although I may fall short sometimes, because I am human, that I try to keep the coin's best interest at all times.

And again, that goes back to going back to the grant thing, just like when Finn left, and everybody was, you know, talking bad about Finn, we let everybody kind of get all that out of the way, and said, all right, that's enough. Just because it reflects poorly on the community. And when I say that, I really mean it.

I love Finn, I love Grant, I love everybody here in the community. But I am, you know, I'm not, I have no personal relationships with these people. I didn't know them before FJB.

So I really just wish everybody would understand that. That's all I ask from you, personally. Just because it makes my job a lot harder when I am being personally attacked for the messages I'm delivering.

And again, I just think this is all our best interest of the coin, which translates into the best interest of each one of our wallets. So that's something to keep in mind. You're always free, you know, feel free.

It's not about me censoring. It's not, again, it goes back to it's really this, you know, us saying, okay, that's enough, no more of when we did it with Finn, when Finn left too, or Grant, it 1000% is not about I am not trying to protect Finn, I am not trying to protect Grant. It's just how poorly does this look for anybody that we may try to get on our team?

Or how poorly does it look for somebody new coming into the chat? Or, you know, some liberals out there that are already think conservatives are whatever. So that's, I think that's all I have to say about that.

But I'd really appreciate if everybody kept that in mind. That's all I ask personally, and I understand emotions are very high, but I'm the messenger. And it just takes away a lot of the time and energy.

And it's kind of ends up being that then we're working against each other. So we either have that choice, whether we work can work with each other, and because we all have the same goal, or we can continue to work against each other, which is going to make it a lot less or a lot more stressful. It's just going to bring morale down for everybody.

I don't have fun when everybody is, you know, really upset in the chats. I'm sure you guys don't have fun. So I think it's just better for everybody and everybody's wallets just all around.

And then we're not working against each other. And we're working together for the same purpose. And we all want the same thing.

Now, as far as questions I got, let's see, pull these up. Okay, so the plans regarding the LP, I believe it unlocks on November 18. If my notes are correct, will they lock it again?

Yes, absolutely. The LP will be locked again immediately. I will double and triple check on that.

I will let you know if that has changed. But that will definitely be locked like it was last time, immediately. So we have some questions and discussion that went on this morning against white listed wallets and X members that are no longer members on the FJB team and why they have white listed wallets.

Again, just please keep in mind that a lot of this is legalities and contracts, legal contracts already in place. I promise BB, you're not stupid. Most everything, there are contracts and legalities behind it.

So that's the reason behind any white listed wallets of members or X members that are no longer members. Merchandise. Somebody asked, can we please update the roadmap for merchandise?

Yes. So yes, we are using someone else and a different company we're going with. However, we had a hiccup in the graphics.

We got the hardest ones redone. Some of the most difficult designs. We still have the few simple ones need to be redone.

So if anybody wants to do graphics, please DM me. Otherwise, I'll have to wait on my husband to do them. And he was super busy with his work this weekend.

So if anybody would like to volunteer, I already have the designs of what I want. And like I said, it's actually the super simple ones that I believe it's two or three of them. But please DM me if you'd be interested in doing that.

And the other one, I think that's about wallets again. Is there any plan or discussion and management to create a new contract with dubious meme coin functions? Remove this provide an opportunity to remove stale naming and provide a clean slate for the utility coin?

I believe so. I think there's a lot of changes coming and that are in the works. And this is why I'm very kindly asking for everybody to kind of be on the same team.

We might need a few volunteers soon. Like I said, we have a lot of changes happening. A lot of good changes.

Nothing major as far as the project being sold or anything crazy like that. Like the rumors. Some of the rumors I've heard floating around.

Nothing like that. But with so many people leaving the project, we just need a few people to replace those. So we will have a few major changes as far as that goes.

Again, to reiterate, nothing crazy like the coin being sold or anything crazy like that. So I think that's all. I don't see any other questions.

Personally, I have no problem with timelines in the grand scheme. I have never complained. But why banning OGs for the fairly tame stuff?

I will say some of the banning was not me. In Telegram or Discord. But again, we put out an announcement.

I think for the betterment of the coin kind of for several days. Just again, it reflected poorly on the coin. It did not have it was nothing personal to the OGs or anything like that.

I might have missed this question. Any update on lowering transfer tax? Yes, I would love to do that.

The only downside of that is we don't want people to then start selling over the counter. But feel free to DM me any suggestions you have outside of that. We're also adding the little buy and sell channel in Discord.

But yeah, let me know if you have any suggestions. Feel free as always to DM only because I can keep better track of it that way. Of course, you can always do both.

Share it in general chat if you want to discuss. No, I am not Grant Stepmom. Yes, I could be yours.

That could be the new rumor. Yeah, I think that answers all the questions. Again, there should be a lot of good changes coming.

Please let me know if you want to do graphics or go bug Roach to do them again. He's upset with me so he's not doing our graphics anymore. All right, I think that's it.

Again, thank you for your patience with me. Again, I appreciate it. What is the structure of FJB?

I'm not sure what that means. Would B&B not have a merch machine locked in? Why are you scratching for designers?

With our volume, I know, I'm sorry. I'm just a messenger. That's what I'm directed to do.

But the designs look good. The ones Jeff did were actually amazing. Then my husband redid a few of them which were great.

I just need a few of the very simple ones. It's like an American flag with something under it. Super simple.

If anybody wants to do them, let me know. Who are the teams? What is your role?

We have a PR team. We have a marketing team. My role right now, that's to be determined.

I'll think of a role name for myself to ask for. How many developers? We've had several.

Like Velo said, depending on volume. Right now it's just him. But depending on volume is when he decides.

He's kind of the manager of the app. Does the team see launch as medium to long term? I will have a better answer for you hopefully very soon.

We have a call today that I should be getting some better updates on. Do we expect to launch before Thanksgiving? Yeah, same answer there.

I'm hoping to have some better answers for you very soon. So it's Boris and Bannon at the top. Dev team and the marketing team.

PR team. Yes. And me.

I think they just want a larger number of holders. Which, yes, would translate into. But I think they just, with the, they just, basically they don't think we would sell that much merch.

So that's been the hold up on that. How many people are totally involved in the project? I'll have to count for you.

As far as like directly not including the outside teams we've hired is just Bannon, Boris, a few of their assistants, and me. Any idea when War Room launch that will bring more holders? Nope.

I'm hoping to get a better estimate of that on today's call. So after launch then merch from volume? No, they actually approved merch ASAP.

We just have to do it a certain way. What's current estimate for launch? I'm not sure there is one.

War Room? Yeah. I'm not sure there is one.

I know they last said when Boris got on, he said we want the off-ram to be ready. I am pushing for that. For Presidents at MAGA rallies, we've been pushing for that for a very long time.

Due to legalities, we have had to wait, but we're hoping on that soon. Is War Room going to be a weekly thing? That was the plan.

That's the latest we've heard was supposed to be at least a weekly thing, a pre-recorded weekly. Does FJA have to pay for that? Not that I'm aware of.

No. So holders can be present at rallies independently. I am not sure.

I am hoping to find that out on today's call because before when we've asked, that's been a no. You're welcome. I appreciate you guys.

I will. Yes, I will update on the call. They are super, super busy, so we actually don't even have a time determined.

I just let them know that I will be free minus this half hour. What happened to the 12 recorded interviews from August 2nd launch? Any info on those?

Were those with major networks? Yes, I believe Finn even posted a sheet with all the names. I don't remember if he blocked those out before posting them or not.

But with everything going on with the Trump raid, that kind of went to the back burner and then they've been busy with the Bannon stuff, unfortunately. Any Velo updates? No.

Again, I'm waiting on those today. I'm also waiting on, I actually am speaking to Transact directly in our FJB Transact chat to find out, hopefully find out more about the accounts that are getting canceled. I know like James and Nolan to see if they can give us an answer on that.

Are the devs hired contractors or part of the team? I don't know if I can answer that question to be honest. I'll find out that.

I'm not sure. Oh, thank you, Sean. That makes me feel like you're not as upset with me now, which might be wrong, but don't correct me.

Just let me think that. Will the recorded interviews be released at some point or was the money paid for them a one-time thing? I am not sure.

I will ask. I am not sure because I'm not sure if they were paid and the network said, okay, but we're going to be talking about this instead. If we refused or I'm not, this is totally just me personally wondering.

Do you know if they will be advertising FJB kind of like they advertise Birch Gold and MyPillow like a commercial ad or is it just a segment recorded during the actual show? I'm not sure. I just know that they recorded it and they said that it would be playing at least once a week.

I'm not sure on, I can actually, what I'll do is go through all these questions and see if I have time to bring those up on the call today. And if I do, I can come back and get you all those answers. So those interviews can get paid for.

Please define backburner. I'm honestly not sure. I'd lie to you if I had an answer.

I will try to find out on today's call and see about that. What is Special Ed's role? Special Ed is no longer on the team.

I don't think so, yeah. He was helping with the dev and as our web developer, which goes back to why I am kindly asking everybody to please try to work together. Not for my sake, not me personally.

I try to never make this about me. I know I do share like things about my dogs and parrots and stuff just to kind of get to know everybody and for everybody to get to know me. But outside of that, I apologize if anything seems like it's about me personally.

This is more so for the sake of the coin, for the sake of who is in here watching us, and for the sake of our own wallets. Awesome. I think that is everything.

What do you think about having biweekly investor meetings? What do you exactly mean by that? Why bi-tags?

There's so many. I think there's so many reasons for that. But we're hoping to get a lot of that changed for something that one, the community will be happy with.

Two, that will benefit current holders and future holders. And three, that will get people to buy this coin. Who's watching us?

Boris? Yes. Actually, I don't think Boris gets on Telegram often, but they do watch the chats.

Yes. I'm sure liberals do too. A weekly call like this with you would be awesome.

Thank you. I am trying to do that. I just don't want to make any empty calls.

So I just feel bad doing them if I don't have any updates or if there's not really any questions. Well, we're all investors in this project. In an investor meeting, it would be structured to report the progress goals, etc.

Oh, yeah. That's a great idea. We can definitely do that.

When the marketing wallet keeps selling, is that going towards actual marketing currently? Or is that paying for the developer's work, etc? I think both.

Everything that, again, there's, I mean, contracts for all of that, legal contracts, and getting everything paid. Boris needs a website update. Hmm.

I'll check that out. I know Boris loves his website. No updates always needed.

Typically, calls like this allows people to feel involved on levels not typical to normals. Well, if you all want calls, then I'm happy to do them. Who controls the TAPs wallets?

I know special ed said the original devs did. I'm not sure if they still do. But I know a lot of that is to be changed and is in the works anyway.

So I'm not sure about that. It still says buy on XT. Oh, okay.

Yeah, I'll get Boris's web developer do. Actually, I'll write that down to update that. Investors want to know what they're investing in, how it works, who's in charge, who's the team, what's the structure of the business, what they're investing in.

Well, I think they know that, how it works, who's in charge, who's the team, and what's the structure. So I think what you're asking is, again, who's the team and the structure? Bannon and Boris on top.

Then their team members. I don't even know. Assistant is not a title bigger than an assistant and me, along with the PR team, the marketing team, and Velo and his dev team.

I'm not sure if that answers your question. Please let me know if it doesn't. Assistant to the regional manager.

No, she's bigger than that. Would Transact be the absolute last hurdle or would BNB hold on for an influencer? No, they are the influencer.

Come on. Any plans to bring Grace on board? Um, Grace stays up to date on everything.

She's basically our war room contact, especially since Bannon has been so, so busy. Bigger like assistant regional manager? Yeah.

Oh, yeah. Maybe that's what we've been waiting on, is Natalie Winters. That'd be nice.

Names of the assistants. Um, I'll ask if I can share that. Sorry, not trying to be secretive.

I just am not sure. Winter is coming, except in Phoenix. I'm in Phoenix, so we don't really get a winter.

They're an influencer, but Boris didn't even tweet about us. I'm like, I'm just saying how wild it feels at times when I have a stepchild. Okay, so they are the influencers, but Boris didn't even tweet about us on the August 2nd launch.

It feels at times we are the redheaded stepchild in their project load. I can totally understand that and why you would feel that way. I think there's just a lot we're waiting on with everything that happened with FIRE.

They don't want that repeated. I know Bannon was very, very not happy about that. We don't want people to think this is some kind of scam.

Think about how the left would eat that up. We know conservatives are lawsuit magnets, so we don't want that. We don't want boomers trying to figure out how to buy crypto that's hard enough for them and foreign enough.

They want to make sure everything's ready. Did you already answer who will unlock liquid or who will relock it? I'm not sure, but I will find out.

Are you a therapist? I can understand why you feel that way. Well, very well.

No, I'm not a therapist. My background's in science. Why didn't Bannon talk about being canceled?

I'm not sure. Honestly, I'm completely 100% assuming, probably because there's bigger fish to fry. I think he was so unhappy about it that we didn't want to bring, maybe?

Again, this is completely me assuming, by the way. This is not anything that anybody has said. I know for me, I probably wouldn't want to bring that attention to it if people haven't heard about it before, because then maybe if we bring it up again, they're going to be like, ah, last time he got canceled.

I'm not buying that. But again, that's 100% my assumption and opinion on why I wouldn't talk about it. Seems clear to me that they are perfecting the product before they push it, which is absolutely the right way to go.

Yes. Boris said this on his call. I don't remember if Bannon said this on his last call.

But he, like I said, Bannon was beyond upset about the whole Wire fiasco. So they definitely want it to be great. It will take time.

Thank you. Money Mitch. Appreciate it.

All right. Wire did us dirty. Yeah.

I'm glad that it happened so soon, though. Imagine. I feel like it would have been worse if it was days later or so.

I'm glad it happened so, so soon. Awesome. Thank you.

Appreciate it. Again, I appreciate everybody coming together. I do appreciate Paradox.

I haven't gone to read anything myself today or yesterday, but she, he did let me know that they tried to get everybody together. I appreciate us coming together for the greater good, for the coin, which will benefit our own wallets and stop us from working against each other.

[Speaker 2]
So no, I don't know why I paradox. Please don't take this the wrong way, but I always thought Paradox was a girl.

[Speaker 1]
So when I found out Paradox is a male, I'm still like, I think it's female, but she's saying that to stay like incognito. So I always refer to her or him as her probably also because it's the cat. I don't know.

I feel terrible, but it's nothing like he just types so well and speaks so well. Can we make Fridays official now? For what?

They? Yeah. Oh gosh.

Can we make Fridays official for $30 buy-ins? Yeah, that's, I mean, that's absolutely fine. I just, my only concern is, well, I guess with 8% tax, that'd be hard.

I was going to say my only concern is if it gets any bigger than pumpers and duppers trying to get in kind of like they would before and after calls and news and things like that. But I think with the 8%, that would be hard to do. We would have to have quite a bit of sales to do that.

We would just need an edited graphic. And I think that's it. But yeah, we, I mean, we can already do that.

That was already, I think I pinned that. That was first posted. Swing.

My concern about this is that the wallet will make trading any crypto easy. Then why buy FJB? Because think about how many first-time crypto holders we already have just in these chats.

Why not buy BT? I think for the same reason that like, why aren't you right now in a Bitcoin chat? Why are you in this chat?

I think it's just something we have in common. I'm sure there's a ton of other reasons too. Yeah, because fuck Joe Biden.

Yep. And the background has more influencers. We honestly have the biggest influencers on board.

So I don't think we've gotten any more influencers as of late. I think they've been busy on getting everything else done, but we honestly have the biggest influencers we need. I'm sure it would be no problem getting any more on board.

We have Jack, we have Ryan, we have, I can't even think off the top of my head because I feel like it's been so, so long. Do your bags match your expectations? Go buy more FJB.

Yep. Awesome. Well, let me know, DM me if you have any other questions.

I will try to get the few questions answered on the call. I do know they are super, super busy. So I'm not sure how much time they will have for the call.

That's dependent on how much time will be available, but I will try my hardest to get answers to a lot of these questions and update you all. Again, I appreciate you all. I appreciate specifically Paradox and Roach for coming in Discord and having that hard talk.

I think he's still upset with me, but I think a lot of truth was answered there on the blog. Yeah, I think that's all. Thank you all so much.

I appreciate it. Have a great night.
