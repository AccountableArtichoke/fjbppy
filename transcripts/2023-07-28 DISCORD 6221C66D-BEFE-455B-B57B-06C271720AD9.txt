[Speaker 1]
Does not feel like a Friday to me, but I'm very glad it's Friday. I hope everybody's had a great week. Saying bye to July.

I have some great news. So get right to it. The dev just started testing.

Everything's going great so far, so good. Actually better than expected because we were able to re-add some great features. So super excited about that.

Again, so far going really better than expected. If testing goes as planned, we should be able to go live within the week. If it does not, then so that's best and worst case scenario.

If it does not, then he has to make some changes and then we'll see how long that takes, but I will keep you updated. Yeah, that's really all I have. That's better.

Yeah, that's it. Let me know if you have any questions. I don't think, oh we did have a fake mod, I think JB in Telegram DMing people.

Please be careful with that. Don't click on links or send your seed phrase. I think that was yesterday if I'm not mistaken.

Dev is also very, very excited to get this wrapped up and move on to apps. So we'll get him on a voice chat as soon as we're live in case you all have any more technical questions. I'm sure he'll be more than happy to answer.

He's been having fun with checking out the general chats. Sorry, can you all hear me? So if it goes as planned, it could get released when I didn't hear you.

If testing goes as planned, we should be able to go live within the week and that is taking into account that all third parties will, everything will go as quickly as they've told us it will. We are depending on several third parties. So if testing goes as planned, we should be able to go live within the week keeping in mind that third parties have all given us time frames and those should all be completed within seven days once Dev finishes up his work.

But I will keep you updated in case there's any hiccups or anything comes up whether that is related to the Dev and his testing or whether it's third parties taking longer than they told us it would take. Does go live mean Bannon starts talking about us in depth? No, because once we get this task completed and announced, then the Dev will go on to working on the app and we need the app for Bannon to do that.

There would be no reason for him to start mentioning us or talking about us in depth without the app working. I doubt most of his demographic are in tune with TrustWallet. So after it goes live, you're revealing the major task you've been talking about.

Yes, hallelujah. I can't wait. It just seems too surreal.

I can't believe this day is getting closer. I'm like waiting for a shoe to drop. Are we sticking with PatriotPay?

Yes, so far. And what about the logo? Same.

Once everything is live is when all that will be released. This includes the white paper. So the reason we have not released the white paper is not keeping it a secret from you all.

It's just we've had to make so many changes from what the team wanted to what we were able to do, whether that's third parties or just how different platforms work, which is why we're waiting on the white paper. White paper is probably going to have to wait literally till last minute because of all the changes, even through testing that I've had and all the changes that have had to take place. And obviously the white paper will need to reflect all that.

I love the Torch logo. We should keep that. I do like the Torch logo.

I'm not sure about the colors, you know, but I think you'll all like the new logo. How much work does the app need? So that hasn't changed.

The dev is not sure to get that to get the app to be functional. I know last dev we have, Nolan, who was amazing. I don't know if Nolan found out if Nolan's...

Nolan has not found out if Nolan's still alive, or at least he hasn't told us. But I know when he was working on the app it was something super simple. It was change now and transact.

They change limits on their ends for transactions and anytime they change that it messes up the app on our side, transactions on that side, and the dev needs to change limits on our side. Now I don't think it should be that this time because our last dev did something that was apparently brilliant, as other members of our team said, where that would automatically, you know, if any change now or transact, change the limits on their back end, our system would automatically recognize that and work around it. So we don't think it's that again, but once he starts working on the app I have no doubt that he will let us know how long it should be.

The nice thing about working on our app is for the most part we're not dealing with a ton of different platforms and third parties. With change now and transact I think it's about it. They lock the contract.

I'm not sure what that's referring to. How much time will people given to transition across the new task? We'll keep you updated on all that.

We'll give you all ample time and walk you through everything that you need to get walked through. Don't worry about that. We will post announcements.

You will have directions. Just follow directions. But everybody will get ample time and it's nothing, you know, if you don't, just don't mess with anything.

Just wait. You can't really, there's not like, it's not one of those where okay you have to do something within 24 hours or now you're going to screw yourself out of your, you know, wallet or your account or anything like that. Maybe I missed this but once the app is live will we get a chance to transfer our coins into the app without the 8% tax?

Wouldn't we want a lot of OGs using the app? So that, we'll get to all that once the dev is working on the app. We're working, the team I make some changes in the app but I'll have an answer for you once we get there.

If everything goes as planned with all these features, I think you'll all, I think we have some amazing features with a brilliant team that has thought about every detail. Considering the platforms and third parties and considering all the kind of parameters we've had to fit in, the box we've had to fit in. We're staying as a Binance coin, I think for a while.

Once we can afford all the relisting fees I think is when we'll also change the FJB. Even Transact can change now. If we change the FJB, consider us a brand new coin which it's understandable.

I get it from their end. It's a lot of costs that we'd think would be put to better use to help grow the community and help make our app very user-friendly. Am I excited?

Oh my gosh, I'm beyond excited. I'm kind of like you know when you're a kid and it's like you feel like something's not going to happen because you're that excited about it. That's how I feel.

I want to celebrate in some way before but I'm like I can't even because then I'm going to jinx it. I need this to actually happen and then I'm going to celebrate once it's complete. I am beyond excited though.

If even half of everything that's being tested goes through. I think we're setting ourselves up for success and for some great long-term changes. Not for anything overnight or not by you know penny by Sunday or nothing crazy like that.

But I think with the team we have we are definitely setting ourselves up for success and for the long term. Task reveal must be closed. I hope so.

I'm like sitting here just hoping testing continues and again if it doesn't I understand you know we'll get through whatever. If we've gotten through everything we've gotten through so far it cannot it cannot be worse. It cannot be worse.

I think with the team we have not having funds misplaced I think those two together we can get through anything and I don't think I think we've gotten through the worst of it which is great. Have I bought back in? No I have not.

I'm sure people would have traced if I bought back in. I've not bought back in. I have my funds still sitting there.

I should probably check on those because if we that's the same reason I've not paid myself. If we need the funds I would rather use them to keep it's a startup you know. I'd rather use those funds if we need them to help get this off the ground.

It's too bad with all the potential we had what unfortunate events we've gone through. Does the task close the disgraceful chapter we all loved through? I sure hope so.

I sure hope so. No doubt. It's been it's been a great great week.

Lived through. Does the task close the disgraceful chapter we all lived through? There wasn't any love.

None? Oh I loved all of you guys. Well most of you.

It's like a it's like a family. No it really has been a great week. Everything's gone super smoothly but again I that's why I kind of feel like oh I'm not you know if testing doesn't go as planned I mean that's why you test right?

We'd rather have it happen now than after we go live. So when it's live we will see the new logo and this will all be very obvious the new direction we're going. Will you finally be unshackled to be 100% transparent with us?

I'm assuming you mean with everything around the task? Yes absolutely. Yes absolutely.

Everything once this is live it'll it'll all be more than obvious. Still feeling confident for War Room launch third quarter? That's I mean right now assuming that testing goes as planned that we go live within you know next week or two or gosh within even four although we're expecting way less than that and then once again the War Room what I'm being told by B&B is once once we have everything together which includes a working app.

Basically they don't want to go you know asking more people to join or buy in when they are getting these angry emails, angry tweets, angry comments on getter. That's what I felt. That's my understanding is if they're already having that they don't want to add more unhappy people to the community.

So I think we get everybody here as happy as possible and do everything we can once we're doing well and have our stuff together then that will be a great time to start growing the community. And this will also be great for our app to grow gradually and start finding bugs if something breaks anything like that versus having thousands and thousands of users and opening the floodgate and having you know somebody like Wire shut us down within a few hours. So I think this will be great for long term but I think most people we've kind of held the floor now.

I think most holders now are really here for the long term. Sure does that mean people aren't going to take profits? No but I think that everybody that's left over I think it's probably here for the right reasons.

At this point I'm not sure anybody's waiting you know for us just to explode overnight. Wow, several buys, huh? There's nothing overnight about this going.

Yeah well a few things a few unfortunate things but yeah as I think all the holders still here. I think that's the charts for the last few weeks. The chart kind of speaks for itself.

Oh as far as somebody dm'd me regarding LBank. They're guys LBank and XT are run by the same people. I'm not sure if they like I guess announced that but on the back end we're dealing with the same people.

So the reason LBank delisted us was the same reason that XT had delisted us which is low volume. So they put us back on they're giving us 30 days to increase volume. If we don't do that then they want to permanently delist us.

So if that's the case we get delisted we get delisted but we'll just kind of figure that out from there. That's why that's why we're really depending on our app anyway and our app the goal is to make that the number one and main platform to buy FJB. Or use FJB for anything else.

When did devs start testing? Late this week. Is there a plan to increase volume?

I'm assuming you mean for LBank. We'll get that answered with the with the task completion. Right now, no.

I suppose our users are welcome to but it's a bummer because we've paid so much for those listings but that's where we're at and that's the reason that LBank delisted us and why some people took them off. Does anyone run socials? Yes, that's why there's new posts every day.

Have they mentioned LBank social media? No, no we've not mentioned LBank and XT probably since we got uh probably since I did social media which has been probably coming up to a year. Probably coming to a year of our last big announcement with our founders.

Good riddance. I think oh looks like I have a DM. I will get to my DMs as soon as I'm off the call.

For your technical support, anything else? Will tasks go live before announced or announced then go live? We'll probably right now the decision is to we're gonna go live on the back end um then announce so uh yeah we'll keep you updated.

Everybody will get ample time don't worry about that and again there's not you know there's nothing on your end that you're gonna mess up for not doing anything basically or for not being online when anything's announced. You don't need to be glued to your phone or laptop. You're not gonna miss out on anything basically um yeah we'll give you give you ample time don't worry about that.

Can there be a count? Can we launch August 2nd? Oh gosh I don't know if devs will be completely done testing by that.

Are we just keeping you know now I'm trying to figure out when when's our um is that in August? I feel like it was in August. Our announcement I feel like it was in August because I was trying to pay like July bills let me see no it wasn't wow I don't know why I thought that was last year August must have been later than that anyway um yeah tell him to hurry he is he's uh I think he he's just as relieved as I am he's uh he understands he's a super funny guy great sense of humor um yeah but yeah we'll it'll be it'll be great and we will get through uh any hiccups again please remember by definition um there will be you know it's not all gonna be wonderful and smooth sailing uh again that's by definition that's why uh the bees took so long to get this approved because they don't want anybody angry um but we will walk you through everything don't worry about that one fjb caribbean cruise hey uh I'm down I'm definitely I'm playing it's been it's been a nice week though because my husband's been gone I've just been getting my alone time it's been great everything with the dev has gone great all week it's been a peaceful week too hot to go outside but other than laying out I go out lay out for like an hour get my son and come back in does that mean he makes fun of the community in your sidechats not make fun of the community that's you know that's not what I'd say um all right I think that's all um please do be careful with the uh scammers coming in and posing as one of the admins um I know there was a fake JB sending links um they'll generally dm you first.

No admin will or should be DMing you first so that's your first red flag. But just don't give your seed phrase or click on any weird links that ask for your seed phrase. Please ask in the general chat.

Somebody who had a fake JB message them that's exactly what he did was just send a screenshot and ask in the general chat if that was actually JB. So very great. Yeah we don't want you losing your funds right now.

That would be the worst time to have that happen. Oh JB is not a scammer. Stop it.

Let me know if you need anything else. Again sorry I missed it looks like I got DM'd this morning. I will DM you on Discord as soon as I'm done here to get that squared away and figured out for you.

If you all need anything else tag me or DM me. We will get through this even if it doesn't go exactly as planned. We'll still get through this again.

I think we've gone through the worst of everything so it's great. We're excited to move forward. It's a great feeling.

I think when most alt coins have died we've kind of died and came back many times over. We're just nothing's gonna kill us so really it can't get worse. Keep moving forward and I think that's something we all owe to the community.

That's you guys because realistically without you I think we'd be a dead coin now for sure. Alright guys have a great night. I will post the recording.

It's still recording right? Yeah I'll post that right now with a few cliff notes. You all have a great and safe night.
