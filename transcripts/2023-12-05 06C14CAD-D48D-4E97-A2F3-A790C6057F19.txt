[Speaker 1]
Happy Tuesday. I hope you guys are having a good week so far in FJB world. Things are moving pretty quickly.

Third party is at the 24-hour line, but that does not mean we're live in 24 hours. That just means they have enough completed that, and this is what they say, so if it changes or circumstances changes or they run into anything, then I'm sure they'll update us, but this is their update as of today, was they have enough completed that all they need from us now is a 24-hour notice for them to complete everything else they need to complete. So I hope that makes sense.

Again, does not mean we're going live in the next 24 hours. It just means that third party will just want a 24-hour notice for them to have everything completed. So that's great news.

I had another app meeting that went great today. We actually hired a security professional and he did find two things. One from last year, actually.

If I remember correctly, November 2022, I think. So that's very exciting because we always want to stay up on security on the app, which is great before we get everything else incorporated into the app. Very important.

The voiceovers have been completed for the video. I'm not sure if I already shared that with you all, along with the music for that to announce everything to you all. Yeah, we just have, as far as going live, we just have one security walkthrough that we need the devs to walk through live with us.

Once that's complete, we will let third party know and then we're good to go. So we are really getting down to the finish line. In my opinion, I don't think we're going to be able to make TPUSA with the app with the way that's going and finding a few security details there.

That's just, again, my opinion with how things are going. As far as still going live this week, I think that is still very possible for us to do as it stands right now. Again, just my opinion right there.

Of course, security and what's best for the coin will remain the number one priority and the team, our advisor devs, will get the final say there just to make sure, again, that everything happens to the best of our ability. Again, textbook definition, we will run into things. You guys just need to sit tight.

Don't do anything on your end right now. I will give you another notice. We'll probably get on a voice once we are going live and just ask you to stop to not do anything because anything that you do, we don't want to cause you guys loss of funds or anything, app account going crazy or anything like that.

Just sit tight. There's nothing. I've gotten a few DMs saying, I'm watching closely in case I need to do anything.

You do not need to do anything. There's nothing. You need to do nothing, basically, if that makes sense.

You do not need to be watching the channels. More than welcome to for us to go going live, but there's nothing I'm going to need you to do. If you're not available when we go live, you're not going to lose your funds.

You're not going to have anything crazy like that, so don't worry or stress about that. We've been through enough. Take it easy.

Don't stress. Again, if you are online and if you are trying to keep a super, super close eye, just follow directions. I'll let you know when you are basically not allowed to do anything.

Just sit there tight while we give you all the updates and then go from there. Very exciting as far as that goes. I want to share some of the video, but I don't want to get Sam upset.

We're not waiting on the video completely.

[Speaker 2]
I don't want to get Sam upset, but maybe I should share a part of that.

[Speaker 1]
Let me download it and see if I can crop out. We just have so many versions. I'm sure if you guys do any video or music or even graphic design stuff, you do the final version and then final, final, and then final two, and then you have to start renaming them again.

Let me see.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to try to crop. Oh, shoot. I wonder if I can drop the voice on it so you guys don't have to deal with that.

I don't know if I'm going to be able to edit this from where I'm at.

[Speaker 1]
I'm on my laptop and I might need to get on a different one once I'm off voice chat to be able to edit it actually to give you the first, I don't know, I can give you the same portion that I did the little voiceover of the other day. I'm sure Sam would not mind you sharing a video. Okay, fair.

Are you ready for your meeting at seven? Yes. Today has been full of meetings.

[Speaker 2]
This one was kind of a surprise one.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shoot. Okay, let me see some questions. Sorry, MP, I missed that.

I was trying to get the video going. I was certain the task was done and everything was dependent on the video. Uh, yes, that was for testing.

And then third party came in and said, actually, we're done, so we need just a 24-hour notice for the final touches. If they are not done within the 24 hours that we give them, then we'll still have you guys test. Now the third party needs to be given permission to go live.

And then this takes, yes, because we were just going to start testing, assuming that third party would take closer to their 10 days or longer. Just they never said they'll take longer. I'm just going off our FJB timeline curse.

Um, yeah. Sorry, I know it's not what you like to hear, but it is the truth.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I thought this one, I saw other questions. I did miss your questions.

[Speaker 1]
How long after the community gets a test will be on War Room? So War Room, we just want to make sure our app is ready. Because there's not really a use to do that, right?

MP says so there won't be any testing, it will just go live. Depending on how our timeline with the video versus third party, third party will not hold us up from testing, if that makes sense. I know you guys are getting frustrated, but you know, and I know, I know I'm the one here for you all to get upset and frustrated with and I understand that.

But I think you'll understand once once we go live, a lot of this will make sense. Again, we're never doing this unless we absolutely have to. We are never doing this secret task thing again, I have decided.

Let's see. Oh, I don't think I have anything in DMs. I would not transfer as far as app goes, I would not transfer any of your coins out of the app right now. Please do not do that.

I'll make sure to post that in announcements. We do not want you to do that. That is we have some users just dealing with some bugs.

So please do not transfer any coins out of the app right now. It doesn't matter what coin it is, seems like transfers into the app are still working. But I would hold tight on that, please.

As far as wire, good news there. The few so I took care of one account, we made sure that user did actually get her funds from wire. Originally, we had another one last minute on Sunday.

And again, beautiful thing about blockchain is we had proof that they actually had received their funds from wire. So that wrapped up very nicely and wire crash and burned and we're still alive. So I'm happy about that.

Let's see, as far as XT and L bank, please get your coins off ASAP. From this point forward, we will not be able to help you. So if you still have coins on there, get them off ASAP off L bank and XT, we won't be able to help you.

Yeah, that's all we're gonna say there. Yeah, that's it. Just don't don't transfer.

Don't try to transfer anything out as far as app at the app goes until our devs get that fixed. Cool. I think that's everything.

I will once I get on my, so I'll get to my meeting at right now at five. And then once I'm off that, oh, I can crop. The first few seconds of the video, I'll share it if you guys want.

But I think that's everything else. I don't think. Let me see.

I don't think I have any emails from you all.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, there's actually somebody having issues.

[Speaker 1]
Let me know if you have any other questions. Please feel free to tag me or email or DM you guys know the drill, call, text, whatever you need to do so we can get you taken care of. Somebody on somebody asked today, are we going live by New Year's Eve?

And I'm like, it better be before that. And you're shooting for way before that. So I think that's all I have for you all.

Have a wonderful night. I'll be I'll be back and probably another hour or so. It was four.

Yeah, 445. My meeting will probably be an hour. And then I'll see you guys again.

Be up all night working on some stuff. Yeah, I'll post a recording and the notes after my call. So give me a little bit.

You guys have a great night. I'll talk to you soon.
