Hello, happy Tuesday. Hope everybody had a great weekend. Let's get right to it.

So, education videos should be available on app if you have an iPhone. We actually just heard back from the third party yesterday so we are working on that. We should have it resolved this week.

Our dev had to make a few changes and now our video producer has to make a few changes to get that working in Safari, basically mobile Safari in the app. I will keep you updated on that as soon as that's working for everybody including Apple users. You should see some changes on our website soon.

I'll just be moving some stuff around, adding some things. This will help us with SEO to move on to marketing. Our Candice Owens TPUSA events are still on for later this month.

That's coming up. It'll be October 22nd and October 23rd for two different campuses. We'll definitely keep you updated on that and share the material we get from that if you are near University of Florida or Texas A&M.

You're welcome to attend, get some live footage for us. That's all that I have to share for now. I will keep you all updated as I get the completed updates.

By the end of the month we should have again the events completed, education videos will be complete, website changes will be complete, all bugs should be fixed. We are aware of some bugs that a few users have found. Some of them have already been fixed and users are taken care of.

Once those bugs are taken care of we will push out a few marketing campaigns of our own. Again by the time SEO is complete then we will continue on to podcasts and we'll start with that. I think that's all I have.

As always if you guys need anything or are experiencing any issues with your accounts feel free to DM, call, text, email so I can get you all taken care of. I think that's everything. I will keep you updated again as updates are 100% complete.

You guys have a great week. I will see you Friday.
