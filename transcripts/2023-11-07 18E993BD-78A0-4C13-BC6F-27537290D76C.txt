(0:00 - 0:20)
Okay, perfect. Happy Tuesday. Hope everybody's having a good week so far. 

I don't have any big updates today. Everything's still going very, very well. My working meeting today went very well, exactly an hour actually.

(0:22 - 1:00)
So that's great. A few of you have DM'd me or even in chat mentioned the website, redirecting, that's only because we're transferring the domain. Well, a few domains, so that probably has something to do with it. 

It's still pending. But hopefully that'll work itself out as soon as that transfer is complete. Working on that today and then also a few other admin things like the switching the emails over from FGB to PatriotPay and all that fun stuff.

(1:01 - 1:23)
Finally moving away from Google as far as that goes. I don't know why that was initially on there, but that'll be good for us. Devs have completed one of the projects and then we're just waiting on them to start the other one.

(1:24 - 1:35)
We have a few things to clear up overnight for them, but it should be morning here soon on their end of the world. And we'll be starting on that. So that's wonderful.

(1:35 - 1:49)
My meeting today was regarding some app changes. That will be a pretty big deal. It'll definitely help us with the current community and growing the community.

(1:50 - 2:07)
So I think that's everything I have to share. I did see a few DMs. Thank you for your patience for those of you who are again, still waiting to access your Smart Wallet funds again.

(2:09 - 2:21)
We do have it fixed. We just have not deployed it just because we would rather roll it out with everything else the devs are working on as far as the app goes. But your funds are safe.

(2:22 - 2:38)
Don't worry about that as long as you have your seed freeze. Let's see. A few quick questions.

(2:40 - 3:01)
Excuse me. Is the task complete? Everything that the devs need to do, our devs, for the task is complete? We're just waiting. Is the task sitting with a third party? No.

(3:02 - 3:37)
Will the task be revealed this week? Likely not. And that's just me giving my opinion. Is the app launch ready? No. 

The devs just wrapped up another project on it, and we have two current projects working on the app. Have the failed transactions been fixed? Yes, absolutely. Although it has not been deployed, so you will not see that on your end.

(3:37 - 4:02)
We just want to get a few other things fixed because if we tell you the failed transactions are fixed and that gets deployed, then you'll be likely going into the app, whether to buy, sell, transfer, and get hung up on the other bugs in the app. If that makes sense. So it just makes sense to get all the app fixes completed.

(4:03 - 4:16)
Just so we don't stress you out. Don't risk losing your funds somehow. Just stresses everybody out. 

I'm stressed out. If you guys are stressed out, we just don't want you to go through that. We don't want you to go through that panic mode.

(4:17 - 4:35)
So we'd rather get it all fixed permanently without, you know, just some band-aids. And then we'll have you guys, and we'll go live for you all to test it for us. We'll have the community go ahead and, yeah, test it in a way.

(4:36 - 4:51)
So we can see if there's any other bugs because generally there probably is. You mentioned that the devs are still working on making sure everything works as it's supposed to. What are the devs working on? That's not quite right.

(4:52 - 5:04)
Is the task, the app, or the new project you mentioned? A few things. As far as the task, that's complete. We just gotta wait on something.

(5:04 - 5:16)
And then the app, the few projects working, yes, are on the app. Yeah. Now we have one, two.

(5:17 - 5:51)
We have two projects going now. Well, if we're counting the one that would start tonight. Will task reveal occur before app is launched? I'm not sure yet. 

That might actually coincide together. And not necessarily that we're planning it that way. Just some things coming up, it might just happen that way.

(5:53 - 6:07)
If that makes sense. Will CryptoAdvisor be on a voice chat prior to launch? Not sure about that. Like I said, maybe if we muffle his voice or something.

(6:07 - 6:25)
I'm gonna try to be super extra nice to him before I ask. Is launch likely in November? So far, I am very confident that it is. We have ample time.

(6:27 - 6:42)
There are some outside factors that we could wait on. If that makes sense. But so far, we are, like I said, task is complete.

(6:42 - 6:59)
Ready to push to third party as soon as we get through this. I'll share more as soon as I can regarding that. Let's see.

(7:01 - 7:17)
I think I got a few DMs on Discord with people with new devices. Again, if you don't have all your info for the app, I've gotten back to everybody on there. So you just need to reply to me for working that out.

(7:17 - 7:32)
And I think that's all the DMs I have. So if I missed you... Yeah, I don't have any in there either. Let me go into General.

(7:36 - 7:46)
Oh, shoot. Tim's looking for a voice. Let's see.

(7:46 - 8:11)
How are you guys finding it? Let me get on my phone. Actually, I don't see it on my phone. Whoops.

(8:25 - 9:02)
Sorry, give me a second. I accidentally... Sorry, I got on my phone and accidentally kicked myself out somehow. Did Tim find it? I see.

(9:12 - 9:27)
Let's see. Any questions in here? Yeah, so strange that our website is doing that. Oh, so many other questions.

(9:47 - 9:57)
Ed says to launch next week. I think that would be a good week. Yes, girl.

(10:03 - 10:14)
I think you guys will probably know when it's all happening. Oh, no. Emergency.

(10:17 - 10:42)
To be honest, I can't find it either from my phone. But I don't want to go back in and kick myself out again. What is he on? Let's see.

(10:45 - 11:22)
Another desktop. And again, I know we had a few questions in chat yesterday. Please still keep in mind there will still be some bugs that'll... Bugs, for lack of better terms.

(11:22 - 11:35)
Just so I don't give up any more info I'm not supposed to. But there will still be some mishaps. Again, by definition, we'll get through them together.

(11:35 - 11:57)
Don't stress out. We'll get through it together and get through it. It looks like it shows up differently.

(12:13 - 12:16)
Weird. Now it's showing up. It didn't show up for me the first time, though.

(12:21 - 12:31)
That's weird. But it's weird. I backed up and then I went back in.

(12:31 - 12:57)
And it didn't give it to me the second time. Or the third time. Sorry. 

Sorry, Tim. Yeah. There's been quite a few glitches with Telegram.

(12:57 - 13:23)
Mine is still glitching where it shows me... Did you answer my question about migrating? No, I must have missed it. Is it up here? Did you ask it? Oh, I see it. Question for voice.

(13:24 - 13:46)
Will there be a way to migrate my coins to the app once we are live tax-free? I don't think so. Unless you're on XT or LB. Not for the time being, anyway.

(13:49 - 14:19)
But I think you will. A lot of other changes that you'll very much appreciate. Can the devs or Vess let a person import a seed phrase? Yes.

(14:21 - 14:35)
I think that's definitely on the roadmap. Super, super great, guys. Oh yeah, guys.

(14:36 - 14:43)
Don't DM Finman. Read stuff. Fin was so good to us.

(14:46 - 14:56)
He's truly such a nice, good person. And he, again, I know a lot of it maybe you all didn't see on the front end. I totally understand that.

(14:56 - 15:14)
But he did do so much good for us. Vess reminded me of that. Because Vess, the two owners are absolutely amazing to us.

(15:20 - 15:33)
Is Boris excited? I think so. I feel like Boris is like my parent. And I'm just excited to show him everything.

(15:34 - 15:53)
Are political donation tabs coming? I think so. I'm expecting another attorney call tomorrow. For a few legal details.

(15:54 - 16:06)
Including more details about political donations. Just some hoops. It's nice because that essentially is our goal for the front end.

(16:06 - 16:15)
To look so simple. And to be so easy and simple to the user. Because I think that's a big part of how we'll grow the community.

(16:15 - 16:32)
Especially when you have boomers and people that aren't exactly the most tech savvy, necessarily. But on the back end, it really was cool to see just how complicated everything is. And every little detail that goes into everything.

(16:32 - 17:06)
But yes, my call with the attorney tomorrow should cover and finalize the political donations. Hopefully we get a big green light. Here are some super pretty people still mad at Finn and you.

(17:11 - 17:25)
Finn, I would not say that if that wasn't true. He seriously did so much for us. And it's unfortunate that sometimes the community doesn't see that.

(17:25 - 17:38)
And he's a very humble, kind person. So he didn't want to disclose that. But I do mean what I say about him.

(17:38 - 18:23)
Stop trying to get me in trouble with financial advice. What else? It feels good for everything to be just going smoothly. And it honestly has been super super fun to look at just all the details that you don't realize go into everything.

(18:23 - 18:47)
From the dev's perspective, the meeting today was essentially how to make everything much easier for the users in the app. And I think it's something that you all will agree with. And that's stayed the goal.

(18:48 - 19:05)
Essentially, at the end of the day, I know you guys are so sick of the time stretching out. But the number one priority stays to make something that will have the highest chance of success long term. While of course maintaining security.

(19:06 - 19:30)
So that's where it's almost, I feel like a lot of it is, or some of it is partially a marketing. And partially just a lot of really smart devs making sure that happens. Aww, you're welcome Tim.

(19:31 - 19:41)
I think the truth always comes out. And I do, that has stayed the same. I do think this project has a ton of potential.

(19:42 - 19:57)
Once we finally got a bunch of amazing people to work on it. I just, I just help direct all those super smart people. I have the easy job.

(20:00 - 20:27)
Can you share any more on the VESS roadmap? You guys should be seeing a lot of what's coming up from VESS fairly shortly. So I think that'll speak for itself. I'm still excited about the, still very excited about the gift cards.

(20:31 - 20:56)
It's like the old team was obsessed about getting the other coins on the app and I'm just obsessed with the friggin' gift cards. To get those on the app. We're too hot to work in 9 to 5. When will Sarah buy back in? I don't know if I could buy back in from my known wallets.

(20:56 - 21:13)
Because I feel like that's just going to cause, that's just going to cause, that'll be like, I don't know. I don't know if I could even ethically do that. Because it would be like, oh, okay, we're going low.

(21:13 - 21:28)
Or, you know, somebody would assume something no matter when it was. Or like, she's trying to pump the charts or what, I don't know, what have you. So I don't know if I can ethically do that from my exact known wallets anyway.

(21:30 - 21:45)
It has to be like from new wallets and maybe I could do like Russ size buys. So everybody can assume it's Russ. LP lock soon.

(21:45 - 22:42)
So LP lock, the only downside of that, well I guess it's a two-fold, is that last time when we were attempting to log into DeepLock, which is where our LP was locked into, we all kind of had many heart attacks because the site was down. And with everything that's been going on in the crypto world within the past year or so, more, I guess, like more publicized scandals, if that's what you want to call them. That's the worry with that, is that we would log it with a site that would go down and then we'd have heart attacks.

(22:43 - 23:12)
And that kind of goes along with a lot of functions that our coin has are not exactly typical in a crypto coin and more RAM as a business. So that's the only downside there, as far as that goes. I sent you a DM a couple of days ago.

(23:12 - 23:33)
Oh, sorry, I'll make sure to... I'm sorry if I don't, definitely tag me when you send me a DM. I actually cleared out my DMs, I don't know, like a few weeks ago. And I have like, I want to say it was thousands because I was deleting 200 at a time.

(23:34 - 23:49)
So maybe not thousands, but I think over a thousand for sure. So it was easier, but of course the scammers come right back in. So I'll look at my inbox as soon as I'm done here.

(23:55 - 24:10)
Will there be more coins added to the app? Yeah, that's definitely the goal. For sure, we definitely want that. And that really shouldn't take much on our end.

(24:12 - 24:37)
But we definitely want everything the devs are working on with the app. I should say, specifically one of the projects they're working on in the app will, like right now, it's kind of like, oh, put your seed into TrustWallet to make that better. But I think the improvements coming will really give us an advantage to wallets like MetaMask and TrustWallet.

(24:39 - 25:00)
We'll see that. Which is amazing. From your magic wallet, what is with Bello getting FJB? Is he still helping? You guys are tracking? Wait, I have to screenshot this.

(25:01 - 25:42)
I'm going to send this to Bello. I'm going to send this before I forget. Bello has... Specifically for my wallet, yeah, I'm getting some help and certain files.

(25:44 - 26:01)
Just info. So some of it, that's from me, from my wallet personally, or from my bank account. But we've also sent him some, I think I've sent him some through the FJB wallet.

(26:01 - 26:17)
Some of those have just been reimbursements for accounts that he was paying for. He's way too busy for us now. I think he's mainly working on AI stuff, he said, actually.

(26:18 - 26:29)
But I talk to him quite often. I think actually we were talking earlier today. I'm 37.

(26:36 - 27:02)
Some people are hesitant to invest in a non-locked LP. Yeah, I totally understand that. But I think we're brainstorming, but essentially I think that's kind of what we're leaning towards, is the risk, at least with just everything we've been through.

(27:05 - 27:37)
And the semi-mini heart attacks we had last time we were trying to pull out our LP from DeepLock. That would be a huge issue. So, the risk of somebody pulling the LP is, to us, way, way lower than having it, the site that we lock it in, just up and disappear one day.

(27:40 - 28:05)
But yes, there's definitely room for brainstorming there, and really just meeting somewhere in the middle. And just making, again, at the end of the day, security is part of the number one priority. We learned that the first time around.

(28:06 - 28:31)
That's the least we could do, is learn from that. Velo sells, I changed my mind, not gonna miss him. No, Velo, actually Velo misses being in this chat.

(28:33 - 29:03)
Just don't make it awkward for him, don't do what you guys do with Finn. But I think he misses you all, and he was, he asked to actually be paid and reimbursed in some FGB, so yeah. And I've always, always, always said that, Velo's always been a super nice guy.

(29:09 - 29:32)
And he has no idea of our coming updates, actually. All the help, he was helping me with the pre-cast stuff. What is, I feel like you've mentioned BSV before, because that sounds familiar.

(29:33 - 31:04)
What is that? What else? Anything else? Please send any, if you pray, send us any prayers you can, just because we'd love for this to keep going as smoothly as it has been lately. I am very, very excited about that. I'm starting to feel a little paranoid, like, wait, what shoe's about to drop? This is going so well.

(31:06 - 31:56)
But yeah, it's all changes that you've all discussed. Over and over and over, so I'm sure and have no doubt that the majority of you will enjoy the changes, in my opinion. I did send him the screenshot. 

I'm sure he'll be back in. I know he has a deadline this week, so he's probably nerding out. Anything else? Again, don't worry about your funds that are in Smart Wallet.

(31:56 - 32:11)
Again, we have fixed everything. We just don't want you guys to go in there and start using the app for all the transactions that you guys are doing right now through Trust Wallet. I assume that would be all, I think.

(32:13 - 32:32)
And then we just don't want you to get super excited and then get some other bugs pop up. So that's why they're working on fixing the other stuff. But that way we just have that peace of mind that failed transactions are taken care of as long as, again, you know your seed phrase, that stays the same.

(32:33 - 32:39)
So yeah, don't worry about that. We do appreciate your patience. You know, we do.

(32:40 - 33:07)
Software needs maintenance and we were without funds for a long, long while and then it was one thing after another, so I'm glad. And again, we are making sure that all these fixes are much more permanent, long-term fixes. It's really fascinating to see who did that, the codes and everything that Dev's doing.

(33:08 - 33:35)
So to help any way they can to help prevent any bug that we're getting, fixing it in a way that, if they can, to really help prevent it ever happening again. Even if it takes longer or costs more, rather than just duct taping, duct taping, duct taping, and it costs us long in the long run. So that's, again, one of the main reasons that everything more recently has been taking longer than expected.

(33:37 - 33:54)
But yeah, cool. Any other questions? I've got to go through all these green bubbles. Cool.

(33:54 - 34:09)
I think that's everything. I don't have any emails and we will be updating. We're waiting on the website on the few domains.

(34:10 - 34:37)
By the way, if you are a business owner or have any kind of website, I don't know if it's a blog or something, Epic is amazing. That's where we have all of our old domains, but our new ones we just transferred over there too. I'll let you know as soon as that's fixed, so it's not redirecting to Mitt Romney's, apparently, PatriotPay.

(34:39 - 35:05)
As always, thank you for being very pleasant. We don't deserve that from you for all the patience and all the deadlines, but I think it will be well worth the... Just needed some good people to get on board. Let me know if you have any other issues.

(35:06 - 35:13)
Please DM me. Again, get your funds off XD. You will not be charged the 8%.

(35:14 - 35:27)
And then please don't share your seed phrase or click on any weird links. Neither me or the admins or anybody else should be asking you for that. If you're ever in doubt, ask in the general chat.

(35:27 - 35:37)
Don't ever just reply to a DM. I won't ever DM you first, and neither will the admins. We'll ask you to DM us.

(35:37 - 35:49)
So please, please, please keep that in mind because that would be the worst time for that to happen. I always feel bad every time somebody gets spammed. Keep that in mind.

(35:49 - 36:15)
As soon as our email updates are waiting on Proton and our domain for that, then we will have the support page live on the website. If you DM me and I don't respond generally pretty quickly, then please tag me too so I can get to that. I think that's it.

(36:15 - 36:27)
You all have a wonderful night. I will keep you updated if we get any big updates before Friday. Otherwise, oh yeah, I think I already forgot.

(36:27 - 36:36)
It's been so much time since yesterday. I think you all saw the LLC for PatriotPay. That's awesome.

(36:37 - 36:50)
Trademark will take quite a bit longer, but we're not super worried about that. We have the LLC for the App Store and the Google. So that's pretty exciting.

(36:51 - 37:02)
I think that's everything. You all have a wonderful night. Again, tag or DM me or any of the amazing admins if you need anything else.

(37:03 - 37:15)
And I'll see you Friday. Probably at the same time I might move it because all of you change your clocks and we don't in Arizona. So it's an hour later for me now.

(37:15 - 37:24)
So we'll see about that. Thank you guys. I will post this recording and some brief notes shortly.

(37:24 - 37:25)
Have a great night.
