Hello, happy Friday, I hope everybody's doing well. Not a lot of huge updates on the front end this week. We've just had a lot of going on on the back end though as far as the dev work goes and some updates there with third parties for our roadmap.

(0:20 - 0:30)
So super excited to update you all on that. Let's first get through testing. I will turn on the switch tonight to have you all begin testing again.

(0:30 - 0:44)
So after I turn on that switch, actually I'll probably do it before I post the notes here. I will have you all again test up to 10 times purchasing that $1 test item in Marketplace. You will be reimbursed.

(0:44 - 1:14)
Please let me know if you have any issues, if that circle just keeps spinning, if you get some sort of error message, if your screen freezes, please reach out and let us know so we can have the devs fix that. For the few of you who have had issues this week testing, please check your DMs or emails, however you all reached out to me. And I will have some instructions there for you to see if we can bypass the issues you're dealing with.

(1:15 - 1:30)
But our devs are thinking this is actually a Polygon network issue. So just some things Polygon's working out versus an app issue, which is great news. But we just wanna check by having you guys do a little bit more testing for us.

(1:31 - 1:46)
So again, just watch out for those emails or DMs back from me so you can help us with that. Again, everybody else, you'll just do the same thing you did earlier this week. Again, test up to 10 times, just purchasing that $1 test item.

(1:46 - 1:57)
And let me know if you run into any issues, please. We will reimburse you by the end of the week here for all the tests you've done for the items. So thank you for that.

(1:58 - 2:10)
Devs are still working on everything else. If that is completed this weekend, I will definitely let you know so that you can all begin testing it. Education video is out for the week.

(2:11 - 2:47)
This one was a pretty important one because those are a lot of the questions we got after any of our ads. Those are a lot of the live chat questions that we got from new users. So again, told you guys, we're gonna be starting super, super basic and going back to just the frequently asked questions and comments on social media of users that aren't very familiar with crypto or some myths out there about crypto and what a lot of the conservatives out there are thinking when they see our app or see advertisement for our app.

(2:49 - 3:00)
If you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out there too. Let's see. Candice, Owen's event, already updated you on that.

(3:00 - 3:13)
Still going on for the second half of the month. That'll be two separate dates, pretty close together. Should be awesome as far as the younger crowd.

(3:13 - 3:44)
So it should be people already pretty familiar with crypto. So excited to see how that goes. And then something, actually the highlight of the week is if you all remember, we had on our roadmap by the end of the year that we would have integrate something into our app that would basically give you access to other crypto platforms.

(3:45 - 3:55)
So you would all have it in one place. You don't need to go sign into a trust wallet. You don't even need to go sign into Binance, anywhere else.

(3:56 - 4:02)
You would just do it all from our app. So you don't have all the safety disclaimers coming up. You don't think it's a scam.

(4:02 - 4:34)
You don't accidentally download the wrong scammy quick swap app and super exciting news as far as that goes. So our plan was for our devs to integrate it a way that our advisor had mapped out, which was phenomenal. However, we got some really exciting news this week from one of our partners that's actually integrating this into their system that we already use.

(4:34 - 4:56)
And they want us to be one of the first to test this out for them. So we are super, super excited about that. This will, I think, be better for us just because this is a much, much bigger company that will be doing the legwork, the testing.

(4:57 - 5:09)
And I think it'll be really great for us. So awesome good news. It felt really good for them to reach out personally to us, have us be one of the first ones to use this, test this.

(5:10 - 5:21)
It is scheduled to roll out the end of the year. We'll be testing it then. And then they wanna go live probably quarter one to quarter two of next year.

(5:22 - 5:33)
Again, that's just what's on the roadmap for them. You guys know how software works, but I'm super, super excited for that. Yeah, really, really good news there.

(5:33 - 6:11)
So what that means for us is again, once one, this is a much larger company than we are doing it, but also this will give our devs the time, that way we have our resources saved up for other work. So this will be great as far as our devs working on the other functions in the app, but also to save our resources to spend on other things like marketing. So super, super, super awesome, great news.

(6:11 - 6:23)
I'm very, very excited about it and definitely the highlight of the week. Yeah, I think that's all for now. Yeah, let me know if you all have any questions.

(6:23 - 6:37)
As always, please remember, don't share any of your personal information. No devs, admins, me will contact you or ask you to send them money or ask you for your personal information. Just be wary of those fake accounts.

(6:37 - 6:50)
We haven't had anybody get scammed for quite a while now, which is great news, but that just means, it's probably closer till the next one happens. So just be very, very careful, please. They always catch you on a bad day.

(6:51 - 7:06)
If ever in doubt, just ask in general chat. There's always one of us around to go ahead and answer that for you. And just be careful signing in anywhere, connecting your wallet for free tokens or other chats.

(7:06 - 7:11)
Just be very, very careful. I would just not use my main wallet for anything like that. Or again, just asked.

(7:12 - 7:21)
Better to be safe than sorry. Okay, I think that's everything I have. I will see you guys in the chat.
