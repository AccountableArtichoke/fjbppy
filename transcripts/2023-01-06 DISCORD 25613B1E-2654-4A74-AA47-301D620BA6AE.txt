Let me start the recording. Awesome. Hello, hello.

Can you all hear me? Awesome. Sorry, I think the music bot is down.

I'll try to play some music. But it's not doing what it's supposed to do. Well, happy Friday.

First Friday of the year, right? Awesome. I hope everybody's had an amazing week.

Oh boy, you're still going on, huh? I am drinking my tea, a medicine ball. So I mixed like some peach and peppermint, added some lemon.

I just wanted to hop on here. I don't really have any updates, but I wanted to hop on in case anybody had some questions. I didn't receive any in DMs today.

Sorry, that's why I didn't make an announcement either. Didn't want to waste your time since I don't really have any updates for you. But if there are any questions, I'd be happy to answer those.

Can't believe we're already a week, just about a week into the new year. LP lock, I believe, is happening tomorrow. But I will keep you updated.

I think Baby FJB will be locking theirs very soon too, although I'm not sure when that's happening. So that'll be nice. I know somebody in Telegram, I think it was two hours, asked if, I'm trying to scroll back to it, do you think we're going to launch in 2023?

And I said I sure hope so. That would be a big problem if we don't. But I'm definitely hopeful for this, what this year is going to bring.

Let's see. I know there's been, Discord's been dead this week, but Telegram's been blowing up. I haven't really been in there much.

A little rough start of the year for me, but I'm getting it together, I promise. Oh, that's a nice post. That's a super nice post.

21 minutes. Cool. Nice.

Let me know if you have any questions. LP lock, no update on the white paper or roadmap, just because we still, well, we have the editors all the way, or almost, still working on that FAQ. I believe they've finished, wrapped up that technology page.

But we just don't want to release something that's not 100% complete. I have a few designs ready for, to add to the merch store, be doing that this weekend. And PG I'm sure will help out with any more.

GiftGuard is still in the works. Heath will release the company as soon as, probably, we'll probably get on a call maybe right after, pretty soon. That's a good idea.

And share all the details of the LP lock once that happens. I haven't had any merch sales in the last few days. I reached out to a few locals via email, but maybe I'll try to reach them via social media to get on our merch and possibly start sharing that for us with a percentage promise to them.

We have that capability in Shopify, which is nice. BNB wallet still be locked after LP is locked? We can unlock them.

I don't think, either way. We can, I believe the plan was to unlock them. Their wallets were just locked to be safe.

Can never assure some people that were worried about the LP being unlocked or pulled. Seeing their wallets are worth over two billion coins.

[Speaker 2]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
The lock provider chosen, do they have the ability for staking and farming? I am not sure about that. Definitely not sure about that.

Any idea of bringing in another owner with them that can be more hands-on? I don't believe so, no. Not adding an owner, not selling, at least not for the foreseeable future.

It's definitely not in the plans right now. But remember, we do have several influencers. Off the top of my head, I'm trying to, gosh, it's been so long.

I know we had Jack, what else did we have? We had Jessie, that's her last name. Let me go, Ryan, of course.

So we have some of the biggest names in crypto. That's definitely not the problem. And I mean, we have Steve Bannon himself.

I hope to have an update, rather, a better explanation for that very soon for the community. I definitely understand your frustration and I have relayed that. And I hope to have an explanation, a better explanation to kind of explain where we're at, basically, as soon as I get approval.

Just more of a pulse, kind of a pulse check in where BNB are at. There wasn't really a question, Tim. It was more so regarding getting somebody on that is more hands-on, more hands-on owner.

I know we're getting a few app users with the circle of death still going. We're actually checking with Transac, Vess, and Devs to see where that issue is coming up from, who's responsible for that. How's the current debt going?

Much left. So thankfully, we have, I'm sure as you all have seen, we've stopped selling from the marketing wallet for quite a bit with all the marketing direct over-the-counter marketing wallet sales we had. We've not made any payments just because we are hoping that starting on the gift cards, the next payment will probably be the gift cards.

And then it'll be I will need to get reimbursed and Bella's payments need to start again. Our Dev is paid, our other Dev is paid off. The gift cards still have another 2k.

So that's where that's at, but we haven't done much with that just because we have very little funds as you all can see. So we're trying not to blow that. We appreciate Bella's patience with us and grace for allowing us to do that.

Hopefully it'll pay off. I have huge faith it will. Boar is close to getting the money back.

I'm hoping to get an update on that. I don't have any time line on that right now or any updates. Sure with the holidays and everything is that kind of, I know the last time I heard an update on that has probably been a few weeks now.

I'm just joined. Can you start over? Nothing really to start over.

I haven't had any updates. I just got on in case anybody had questions. Sipping my tea.

Hoping I feel better. I'm not feeling so great. I hope my animals stop dying in 2023.

I feed my animals like the best food. They all get raw, organic. It's insane.

I don't do pellets. I don't do kibble. You'd think.

But that's my wish for 2023 so I can stop feeling like crap every time one of my animals dies. YouTube has been the biggest pain. I've spent more hours with YouTube, Google, and now they are saying our account isn't suspended even though we have an email saying our account is suspended.

They're saying it never was. So it's been a huge pain. We tried then to get a YouTube channel through our other email because we have a few and that wouldn't work either.

So three of our emails now. Three of our FJB emails. Oh, that's crappy.

Let's watch this video. Lovely. I love that.

That's beautiful. I like that a lot. Nice job.

I love that. And I love the silver coin still. That's amazing.

Our social media is still amazing. Social media is looking great. Our website looks good there.

I think you guys will be very excited about that. The updates coming on there. Is there a point when you think Fanon will begin to assert more influence day to day?

Yeah, definitely. I think again right now I'm hoping we get an update for the community on where we're at with some sort of date. I know I'm not a fan of dates either but I think getting even like a ballpark, quarter one, quarter two, you know, something like that I think will be great for the community.

When website update released? I'm not sure but if you would like to help with that editing, let me know. I know you've done a ton though.

Thank you very much. Thank you for the beautiful new rose bot welcome message in the telegram. That's amazing.

Do we need a perfect app and an off ramp? We definitely need the perfect app. That app, and I don't know if you all heard Velo a few voice chats ago, really the best way, as he said, to go ahead and stress test our app is to have some gradual growth first and to find those bugs.

The last thing we want and the last thing Fanon wants is for us like right now if we got on war room right now, there are bound to be bugs that come up that have not come up. Just because we're all, you know, most people here have really bought in everything they can. And can't afford to or don't want to buy any more.

So it's been difficult to find any bugs for any bugs to come up. And the off ramp transact is still scheduled to get that done by quarter one. So we'll have an issue with that.

More so getting the app ready, because I mean, we know who we have, right? Having Steve Bannon having Boris, having, you know, people like jack so it or Ryan, I mean, we already have the top names in the conservative world. We already have war room, we have all social media that all those influencers are on.

That's really not the issue. Of course, you know, that's why we're doing grassroots marketing for the time being. But if we were to get on war room right now, I think it would be a huge mess with bugs.

Oh, thank you, Ronnie. That's so sweet. Ronnie's the sweetest person most of the time.

Why won't they pay out of pocket for the app? I don't know. I have not gotten a answer for that.

But I imagine like most people, they just want to keep their business separated. And they put quite a bit of cash into FGB already. And also, they are putting money into it right now, unfortunately, for different reasons.

So but those are all just my, my observations. This is not like an answer from BNB. I was looking into an event today.

It's like a big kind of outside country concert. I don't know if you guys have them over there. called boots in the park here and they do it every year.

And they wanted $2,500 as a vendor fee. That is insane. And it's I mean, it's, it gets busy.

But that's, that's absolute insanity. I don't think it would pay off. I don't think it would be that busy.

Thank you, Ronnie. Without you guys, we'd be doomed. Because you all are what's holding us all together.

Any updates on the breathing on his own. I'm so out of touch with any news. This week, especially actually.

Hi, what are you doing here? How do we increase app usage to get bugs out before launch any plans? Yes, absolutely.

That's why we are waiting for the gift cards. The whole idea behind the gift cards was not well was less of like us, you know, buying gift cards to give people and more of a way to be able to quickly sell FJB to people out in public or wherever, right? Instead of it being a such a process and people, you know, giving somebody a flyer or business card, and I'm saying, Oh, I'll get to it.

That way, it's pretty straightforward. So that's, that's a starting step. I thought your New Year's resolution was going to be stop mentioning Finman.

Did I get that wrong? I swear I have a screenshot somewhere. Oh, Winston says full resolution.

But I think he failed it in like day one. We have the closet. I don't know what you want from there.

Oh, Carrie is your mom, Finn's girlfriend. I've never seen Finn's girlfriend. She'd be hot.

I feel like Finn would have good taste. What are you doing? You want to sit up here?

Not everybody wants to hear your panting. Thank you. Thank you.

I'll ask what happened. No, thank you. Okay.

I've seen you say stuff about him in Telegram though. Does anybody else like to squeeze their teabags or just me? Once it's cold though.

Can we have a day, a one day where holders can vote on proposals, that would be awesome. What kind of proposals? Surfer, are you a holder again?

Without doxxing, do you know who bought five hours ago? Was that the V1 wallet that Z-Money was talking about? Yeah, I have no idea.

I haven't asked around though. I'm sure somebody might know. I can ask around.

It wasn't me, I know that. So what is five mil now? 358 mil or so, huh?

That's just in one wallet? So they may very well have bought. Yeah, I have no idea who that is.

We'll ask around though, see if anybody knows. Most wallets are known, I think. Surfer dude misses that FJB Eagle so much.

Mayhem, that hasn't changed. The app logo will get updated once we can afford testing because the devs, both ours and the Vess devs are worried that an update, that any update through the app store and Google Play store will mess with Vess and wipe users' Vess keys, which is the absolute last thing we want. But that's why that hasn't been a high priority.

And I know, I am aware, I have seen the conversation here regarding the logo updates. The lead dev is Bello. Vess says they don't think it would, but they would definitely want to test it first.

That's not something they want to risk. Time to build regarding the gift cards. I will DM you personally regarding that.

Thank you, sir. Any other questions? I'm trying to figure out what to do for dinner.

Alright, well, if that's all the questions, I will go ahead and log off. I do have a recording. So we'll upload that before I get off.

As always, if you have any other questions, feel free to DM me. We'll keep you updated on everything else and with any other updates. Alright, thank you all so much.

Have a wonderful night.
