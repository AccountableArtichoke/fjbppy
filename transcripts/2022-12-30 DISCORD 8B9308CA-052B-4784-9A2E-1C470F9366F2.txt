[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I'm two minutes late. I have to make my snack. All right, so I didn't post an announcement today because I really don't have any crazy updates.

I just wanted to hop on in case anybody had any questions. And I mean there's a few small updates, but everything I mean it's pretty much we're waiting. We're waiting.

We're waiting on everybody still. We got the P.O. Box notary done, so waiting on that. Bannon and Boris are checking out our merch.

Let me put my charger before my computer dies. We'll announce the new tax structure tomorrow night. Winston's asking.

And then tomorrow night, actually, Baby FJB owners want to burn five million coins just to kind of, you know, let this year go and start off the new year on the right foot. They also will match another five million coins. If the community, if anybody from the community wants to burn any coins, they'll match up to five million.

So for a total of ten million coins, so that's pretty sweet. A nice little start to the new year. Be nice to announce that with the tax structure too.

So I think that'll be pretty cool. When end racist FJB tax? Once we're rocking and rolling, we're still, you know, still getting everything set up.

Or reset. A big reset button, I guess.

[Speaker 2]
So I hope that answers your question.

[Speaker 1]
Carrie B. Capital, I've never actually read your handle. It's one of those that I start reading and I'm like, whatever that is.

[Speaker 2]
Anyway, let me know if you have any questions.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just kind of tough with the holidays. I was talking to Boris and Boris' assistant today. So in that conversation, like I said, was regarding merch and just finances, bank account stuff.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sorry, are you having trouble hearing me? Can you hear me now?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, Ed, the awesome. Thank you. I have to look at that, even though I know Jeff Roach is the only invisible one.

But you have a new profile picture. Yes, Ed, there is a new tax structure and we will announce that yesterday. It'll probably be a little bit earlier in the day.

But we'll definitely set a time just in case everybody's out and about. I'll probably be in unless, I don't know, we go to a friend's house or something. I hate going out for New Year's anymore.

I'm too old for that.

[Speaker 2]
I made a pizza and a glass of wine.

[Speaker 1]
Yesterday was like the worst day of the year. It was so awful. So I'm sorry I've been a little MIA.

I was trying to spend time with family and friends. We have a family birthday on Christmas. So it started like a good taking a break a little bit.

And then yesterday was awful. My favorite parrot died. He had a heart attack and passed away in my arms.

Parrots live like at least generally like 60 years, but like up to 100. And mine was 17.

[Speaker 2]
It was my favorite one. Super, super sad.

[Speaker 1]
But I hope you guys are having a better week before the New Year starts. Will you be leaving us soon? No, not that I know of.

I guess if Bannon and Boris say, hey, you gotta leave. So who knows, maybe. Thank you, Winston.

Yeah, it was awful. I've never had to deal with a pet passing away, but August was my favorite dog. And that's like still super hard.

And then that happened yesterday. So it was super awful. It was very, very sudden.

But parrots hide. Birds in general hide their sicknesses. Because a bird flock in the wild, if there's a sick bird, they leave them.

So they try to hide their illnesses. That way they're not left behind by the flock. So it just makes me even sadder that he was hiding it for so long.

It's about the time where the person leaves us and runs off with the money. Well, you have to have money first. So you don't have to worry about that because we have no money.

Right. Yep. At least maybe three months, six months.

You got to wait. Make it worth it. I'm kidding.

I would. If I wanted to run away with money, I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to run away with money from one of the top attorneys in the country.

Stupid, but not that stupid. Moku Maki. I've never actually said your name.

I usually just go with Moku. Says the baby FJB owners want to send 2022 out in a ball of fire. We will match anyone who wants to burn FJB up to a maximum of five mil between now and midnight tomorrow night.

So if we can get the community to burn five million, we will match that for a total of 10 million burned. Join us in the burn party. Heath.

Nothing. Not really. Not much Heath.

I don't have any major updates. We're still kind of just waiting on everything. But I wanted to hop on in case anybody wanted to hang out or have any questions.

We're just today. The holidays have been really busy. So today was actually my first interaction with Boris and his assistant in a few days.

Probably since may have been Christmas. So we just discussed merch. We're having Ben and Boris check out our merch store and finances and banking stuff.

What's the next thing we're waiting for? Waiting to make the donation that baby FJB so graciously donated. We're just waiting on the organization.

But again, I think a lot of people literally just close for this week or two. And P.O. Box. We got the notary done and turned in.

We're waiting on our P.O. Box because a few applications need an address. That is like a physical address where we can actually have packages go out to customers versus just our LLC address. And what else are we waiting on?

We're oh, we're waiting on the FJB gift card. I did get an update on that today. They should be finishing up early next week.

But we'll see how that goes. Tax structure should be released tomorrow. Thank you.

Boris is the man and when he is ready, you've all seen him fired up. I see him fired up all the time. It's pretty fun.

Get Boris mad and it's good. Are we waiting for app developments before Bannon jumps on again? I think they definitely want.

There's not been like a, oh, we need this exact thing before you guys go on War Room. I think that changed after we got everything kind of rolling again. But I definitely think after the whole wire fiasco, Bannon definitely does not want to be put in that position again or want his viewers put in that position again.

So I think we definitely, and I don't know if you all heard the voice that Velo was on. I know my recording was awful, but Jeff Roach's was great. But even Velo was saying, somebody asked, I forget who, about, sorry, goodness.

I just, something else came up and I'm like reading the messages coming in. So I can't concentrate on what I'm saying. But somebody asked how we can stress test the app.

And that was Velo's answer is really the best way to do it is we got to gradually figure out the bugs. So it would ideally be best if we did just gradually grow just a tiny bit using, you know, just grassroots marketing, whether that's in-person from in-person events or online. Obviously, social media is huge, right?

To work out the bugs before we do something huge like War Room where we're going to have, gosh, I forget the numbers now. I'll have to look that up in the first few hours. I think, I want to say it was like 2,000.

If it continued for the rest of the day, we would have been on par for 10,000 new users. Don't quote me on that off the top of my head. That's what I'm remembering.

So we think that would be best to kind of make sure we're flowing before we have a huge blitz all at once and have thousands of people trying to get on at once. Any update on LP lock and white paper? Our editors are still working on the tech page and FAQs for the website.

They'll be moving on to that. As far as the LP lock, I will see if our advisors are available. I know it's New Year's with the holidays to take care of that tomorrow as far as the LP lock goes.

As far as the white paper, we are keeping most everything pretty much the same. It'll just be edited as an update, but most everything will be staying the same and continuing with what the team had planned before. The coin burn is critical to price appreciation for long-term holders.

Please push that, please, please, please, please. Yes, coin burn as is money to LP. And just to clarify for the new tax structure, this will just be a tax structure for phase one.

So this is in no way, shape or form a permanent tax structure. And I do want to make that clear because we eventually do want to lower taxes much lower than, you know, lower than 8%. But I do want to make that clear so that nobody is disappointed that this is a no way, shape or form a permanent tax structure.

This is just something for the time being and like a phase one. Hit up the Savage Angels for pre-war room testing.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I've never heard of that. I'll have to look that up. Is that like some secret society?

[Speaker 1]
Have you got any idea of how much non-FJB coins are in the app by the holders? I do not. I can ask to see if there's any way we can check on that.

What's up with Transac still taking 40 minutes or more to buy FJB? It's the same using trust wallet to buy. Are you guys working with them to speed things up?

Yes, definitely. Transac is going through a ton of growing pains. So we do appreciate your patience.

For dealing with that. But this is great in a lot of ways. To be growing with them and be, you know, our app will get better as they get better.

Savage Angels, it's Grace Chong, Captain Bannon and one more, three more. Oh, I have no idea. Actually, I think I do remember now.

Don't you have a meme with that? Maybe I do remember that. I feel like I've seen that.

I feel like that's not the first time.

[Speaker 2]
I just didn't connect the two.

[Speaker 1]
Grace is an angel. She's amazing. Somebody ask her if she wants her FJB merch.

Or I can text her again. Will the app buys still be tax-free? Yes, for the time being, I believe so.

Because of the way everything on the app works through Transac and ChangeNow. At least for the time being. Old turd coin holder is out to collect cans and buy more.

Thank you for sticking around. You guys do all the hard work. Ed says, any update from Transac or Juno with regards to USG Off-Ramp?

Nope. They are still testing. I know they said quarter one.

I hope from the sounds of it, it'll be earlier than the end of March. But I think we can keep that. That's my puppy at my door.

[Speaker 2]
Text my husband.

[Speaker 1]
Grab him. This little brat. So we take him to the dog park.

Or not the dog park, but our neighborhood park. And there's always this group of eight or nine-year-old girls. Four of them.

And he runs to them and just plays with them the entire time. We come back home and he still has all this energy because he didn't play. Farkas says, did I miss update on new tack structure for holders next week or so?

Tomorrow. We should be announcing that tomorrow. As long as everything goes as planned.

I'll try to make that voice a little bit earlier and record it. I know you guys all have lives. And probably don't want to be here on New Year's Eve.

When things go as planned. So far, I think, I mean, not trying to toot my own horn. But I feel like we've, for the most part, things have really gone as planned.

And I know Diesel Express was saying earlier, I'm making up my talks with Boris. But you guys gotta think, the chat hasn't been wiped. So, Boris or Bannon or Grace can come on here and literally check anything I'm telling you.

There's nothing I'm lying about. I've truly not lied to you about anything this entire time. There are times, yes, I've been misled.

And share that with you. But, you can very well get on here and see everything I'm telling you. And then the voice chats are all recorded and saved.

Nothing gets wiped before they come on here. And when they come on voice, we're not going to wipe everything before they get on. When imaginary Boris friend for long-term holders.

Have you guys talked about eventual War Room push? Who would sell it? B&B, Velu?

You mean who would talk about it on War Room? Oh, I think it would definitely be B&B like before. Yeah, because the viewers trust them.

That's who they go on War Room to watch, right? They don't go on War Room to watch Velu. They do not know Velu.

They do not, you know, know me. They don't. So, they're going to trust somebody who they get on to watch every day.

How can our group boomslang an eruption of interest without HQ input? So, Amazon kind of messed us up because we got approved for the seller account, correct? But then, of course, we got denied for their merch account.

So, now I'm working on getting our merch on there. But not through Amazon Merch on Demand. So, that's a little bit longer of a process, but I think that would definitely help.

Getting business cards to everybody. More affordable business cards than Printify can offer. And stickers, more affordable.

Just like sticker rolls, you know? You get a hundred stickers for, I don't know, I don't even remember. And I don't even know with inflation now.

But something a lot cheaper to just put everywhere. MJ's asking, how many daily viewers does War Room have? I haven't looked at updated numbers.

Let's ask. Let's find out. Let me text myself and pretend I'm texting somebody from War Room.

And then I'll answer myself and let you guys know. I'll just guess.

[Speaker 4]
Mm-mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
Danny T says over a million daily viewers worldwide.

[Speaker 2]
Let's ask somebody from their team. So, we'll see, I know. Suede just put something on here.

[Speaker 1]
Definitely gone down during the holidays. That's pretty normal.

[Speaker 2]
Talking like, what, 67,000? Wait, this is subscribers, though. Let's see.

[Speaker 3]
Excuse me.

[Speaker 2]
Can you pin it? Uh, yes. Just gonna read DM to you guys.

I'm not being secretive, but. I have a Christmas gift of 1,000 doll hairs for marketing.

[Speaker 1]
Where do I send it? Russ says. Oh, my goodness.

Well, you have to, it depends on what you want to spend it on.

[Speaker 2]
Click the chat. Could be podcasted. Mm-mm-mm.

Yeah, I see those are subscribers. I wonder. Hopefully I'll hear back right now.

It's about dinner time, though. And it's New Year's. I feel like most people are out doing stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh. Baby FJB. Moku just burned 1,000 FJB.

He just did the first burn. And he's matching them as they come in. So if you want to burn any coins, feel free to send that over.

DM it or let me or Moku know. Oh, that's a lot of Telegram channel subscribers. Wow.

I know I've looked at viewers before, but it's been a while. I imagine they increased a ton with the COVID and everybody being at home. I know I've never had this much screen time than I have now.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
Perry says, I'm not listening to voice, but Pooh coin ads are fairly cheap right now. $500 would fund an entire month worth of ads on Pooh coin. That's how I find out about the latest and greatest shit coin to invest into.

My only issue with Pooh coin, not saying no to it because that's pretty cheap. But if you're going to get just, you know, people there just to pump, dump the coins. Not somebody who's actually interested in everything we stand for in the cause, which I get.

Like, hey, anybody who will buy FJB will go for it, right? But thinking long term, I don't know. What do you guys think?

Dallas says, do it. Yeah, we can always do that. Aver G12 says, so we mooning in 2023?

Hey, that gives us tons of time. The big guy says, maybe test running ads on a few sites and see which performs the best.

[Speaker 3]
I knew what you meant, Dallas.

[Speaker 1]
Nobody's taking advantage of the merch store 20% off. That makes some things literally at cost. I think we've had one order since we announced that and they didn't even use the coupon code.

By the way, we get most of our traffic to the merch store comes from Twitter. So just to FYI, I think people, sorry, my chair keeps making noises. Hopefully it doesn't sound like I'm farting.

But yeah, so seems like that's where we get the most traffic from. So if you ever want to share the merch stuff, that, and I imagine Getter would probably be a good one too. I'll have to look into the Pewcoin ads.

I know we've done those before, like very early on. But those are not terrible numbers. Nice, enjoy.

Don't have any crappy beers, make it worth it.

[Speaker 2]
What is everybody doing for New Year's? People still go out. I just can't imagine dealing with all that traffic, but maybe I'm just so lazy.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, prime rib and bourbon. I was eating leftover prime rib for probably like four or five days. So good.

Diesel, are you in a voice? Let's see. Let's see.

Yes, you are. You just DM'd me. Let's talk about why it's a good timing to bring back the old management habit of Gulag.

Because you always, you constantly accuse me of lying to you about the things I'm saying. So I don't think that's old management ways. I think that's just being a downer.

I understand your frustration, which I think I've said that many times. I share a lot of your frustrations. But to repeatedly say that I'm making up, that I'm even speaking to boys is, I mean...

Honestly. You can go ahead and email Boris on his website or reach out to him on social media. And ask.

Wind, share, delusions. Yeah. Don't get me wrong, I am very, very sorry and trust me, I am still personally working through that.

Of things I was misled by. But that Finn was misled, B&B were misled. I am not alone in that.

I feel awful for that. We all do. And we've all taken care of it as soon as there was any sign of it.

As soon as we had any proof of it, as soon as we knew it was real. Again, I do feel awful about that, but it wasn't just me. Like I said, Finn, B&B, everybody.

So yes, I understand I'm the messenger, but I was not the only one misled to share whatever I shared with you guys. Yes. Anything more on white paper update and release?

Yes, we are keeping pretty much the old white paper. It will be edited. Obviously a stack structure and a few small things, but we are going to keep going in that direction.

The editors are still working on the tech page and FAQ for the website. Nice. Wow, Keith.

Keith sent 10k FJB to the burn. Moku will match our burn up to 5 million. Yes.

Baby FJB owners are burning 5 million FJB to start the new year right, but they'll also match an additional 5 million FJB. Pretty nice of them to do. Diesel says, so why we hyped new white paper just to say it's the same as the old one.

Why? I'm pretty sure I've shared quite a few times that we're not sure. Checking with management to see if we're completely doing, you know, an entire new white paper or just revising the old one.

If you felt otherwise, I'm sorry for that. But I think I tried to make it clear a few times that that's kind of what we were waiting on. Nice.

Oh, I was trying to see Pat's message, but it disappeared. Where did you mean to paste that, Pat? Gosh, how come side chat deserves the...

And we don't. How does a burn help? So burn brings supply down because those are coins you send to burn wallet, right?

So those coins are coins that nobody can ever sell again. So bring supply down. Well, the lower the supply is, the higher the price goes.

Which, I don't know, what do you guys think about doing a big burn? I don't know how everybody feels about that. Burn, baby, burn.

Carrie B. Capital, I'm watching you. How about a big launch?

Yep, we're doing everything we can to prep exactly for that. Moku makes a good point. FJB is also getting the tax on the transaction, so it helps support the coin that way also.

What's the burn goal amount? Are you talking about the one baby FJB owners, Moku and JL Young are doing? They're doing 5 million on their own, and then they're matching up to another 5 million coins.

So up to 10 million, but at least 5 mil. Did you tell me to be careful? With the beers you're drinking tonight?

Yeah, I said make sure they're not, like, crap beers. If you're gonna ingest that poison, make it worth it. And, like, crap alcohol is, like, even worse for you.

Just worse poison. Make sure you take some Milk Thistle and Tudka tonight, and then some activated charcoal. But space them apart.

You'll feel a lot better in the morning. Drink tons of water, too. Like digital...

Like August 2, Digital Airstrike of the Ages and FJB Week? Whoa, can't wait. Again, I really wish I could give more details on that, but I promise you, Finn was not the one to blame for that.

I can promise you that. And I have no reason to lie about that. I think there's someone in your household with a similar name to mine that you said be careful.

Well, I don't know who, because I'm in the office all by myself. Diesel said... Diesel, are you sending these for me to reply to you?

Or to announce? Or are these supposed to be private? Because I don't want to read them out loud if they're supposed to be private.

Diesel says, whatever I want, ma'am. He said, Sidetrack has no gulag. It embraces the freedom element of FJB.

Why is nobody to blame for anything? That's not the case. Again, the case why you got in the gulag is because you keep claiming that I am making up my contact with Boris.

If Boris was not such a private person, and if it would probably not very much upset him and get me in trouble, which I hate being in trouble, I would screenshot you his texts. I am not making up. I have no reason.

And I have so much money invested here, and I have so much... I'm down so much that I have no reason to pretend that I have direct contact with Bannon or Boris or their team. I would just sell my coins and get out.

I would not be here dealing with this. I do not enjoy dealing with this. Love you guys, but...

And saying there is nobody to blame is not legally. I cannot speak on that. When I say, oh, Finn is honestly not to blame for August 2nd, take it as you will.

I have nothing to gain. You can keep going on and on about Finn. I just want to let you know that I wish I could speak more on that, but trust me, Finn was not at fault for that.

And that was probably one of the biggest reasons that Finn finally decided to walk away from the project. And additionally, and last thing I'll say about that, is actually Finn was a very, very, very... played a very large part in why we are still here today.

And that's all I'll say about that. Why is nobody to blame for anything? I meant when you say you and Finn and nobody else was involved in digital airstrike.

There was a lot of people involved in the digital airstrike, but it was not Finn's fault why everything happened. Again, I have nothing to gain if you keep going on and on about Finn. I'm just saying that just if it helps you any.

And again, I can't say details. I wish I can, but you answered that. Yeah, thanks.

Okay, awesome. I am glad I can answer that, Diesel. Can I post a graphic of Finn?

As long as it's not X-rated. We're not trying to get our server shut down. I think that would make some people happy, and the last thing I want to do.

So as long as it's not an R-rated one.

[Speaker 2]
You guys.

[Speaker 1]
Do you know if Finn is still a holder? Yes, absolutely. Finn is still a holder.

I talk to him actually pretty often. I think I talk to him less on Christmas. He's honestly a very, very nice guy.

I think if you guys knew more, you would agree with that too. I promise. And I hope one day you do know.

When's this legal case going to be over?

[Speaker 2]
My pizza was a little bit too crispy.

[Speaker 1]
Does Finn have more coins than you? I'm honestly not sure what Finn holds. I'll be honest.

I wouldn't think so. Because Finn came kind of late. So our coins were worth...

I've got to look back. Did he come in? I'm trying to think of when he came in.

Was it February? No. Big Dal has it.

.002 or so. Yeah. Let's see.

Let's calculate that out. And also, I know he's put money into... What was it?

I think a little bit over $20,000? Into marketing too. Let's see.

Oh yeah. At that price... Well, I don't know.

Yeah. At that price, I really don't think so. But I'm not sure.

That's completely me. Pure assumption. Did any of Finn...

I'm just reading DMs. Did any of Finn's tour stops actually happen? He promised he'd promote FJB at them. I am honestly not sure.

I have not heard anything about them. I can ask. I know at the time being when he first announced them, I let him know because I think he was supposed to have tours here.

I can't remember now if he said that or because I actually looked it up. And it had Phoenix on the schedule. And I let him know that I was here and willing to help with anything.

But yeah, I'm not sure about that. When is the event... Excuse me.

When is the next... Trying to eat. When is the next event you'll have a booth?

I really would like to get early January. The only... And I don't want to make it too early because I know everybody's broke after Christmas, right?

But... I think I've told you guys this. We have like tables.

I don't know if they still do it because honestly, I don't drive as much as I used to because I'm always home talking to you guys. But they use... We have like dirt fields out here and they just set up tables and sell that kind of like MAGA merchandise.

And a ton of people stop. And I'm more than willing to do that. The only issue is trying to decide because unlike Printify or a merch store right now, so the way our merch is set up right now, it doesn't get printed until somebody buys it, right?

Which is awesome for somebody super small like us. That way, we're not wasting money. And if somebody doesn't like the design, we don't have like, you know, 100, 500 shirts or whatever it is.

Obviously, in person, you can't do that and you have to order the shirts. So my biggest thing is getting designs that are a little bit more mainstream. Still like MAGA and conservative and red, right?

But ones that most people would like and really be like, okay, I gotta have that. Even if it is like 20, 25, 30 bucks. But definitely, we're shooting for January.

That's the biggest problem right now is trying to decide on those. I think I spoke about that the last few voice chats. Let me know if you guys are willing to vote on those.

And again, kind of keeping in mind like, oh, most normal people would want this shirt versus this one. So let me know. I need like winter to be over.

I don't do well with like gloomy weather. I need the sun. All right, bye Perry.

Perry blessed us with his presence but then he had to go potty.

[Speaker 2]
Guys are so gross.

[Speaker 1]
Are you going to host a party when we get to a penny? I'm fine doing that. Gotta bring out my calculator for that.

Yeah, that's been a while. Let's see. Let's see.

Oh yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. We can host a party wherever you guys want. Forget what we planned before it's been so long.

[Speaker 3]
Any more questions?

[Speaker 1]
I haven't gotten an answer back, by the way, on the daily viewers of Whirlwind. Diesel says, is 21 in voice audience a success? Grant regularly had over 100.

Do we have too many folks in Gulag or band? What do you think? How can we get more engagement?

I think we generally have way more than 21. I didn't do an announcement today because I honestly didn't have any solid updates. I didn't think it'd be worth pinging people and getting them on for that.

But I figured I'd still get on for those people that were still on or the people that were planning for it or the people that had questions. So yeah, I'm not really in competition with anybody that was here before. If I wanted to continue doing things that went on before, I would do them and we would get even better numbers, I think.

But sometimes doing things the right way takes longer. First time listening, and this is like a twice a week AMA, so kind of cool. Oh, thank you.

Come and hang out. I thought more people would get on voice to chat, but I guess not. I guess I just get to sit here and talk to myself.

You know what I do miss? I do miss Jackbox. I feel like we should bring that back.

Ooh. Update. There was just another 50,000 coin burn.

Nice. That's awesome. Oh, that's what I was saying.

I don't think anybody answered. What do you guys think about a coin burn from FJB? Not like in the tax structure, but just like, oh, let's do a coin burn.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Well, it doesn't seem like anybody has any more questions.

[Speaker 1]
And nobody has any input on the coin burn. Diesel is disappointed that we had 21 listeners, even though I promised I did that on purpose. I didn't want to send an announcement if I didn't have any real updates.

But I just want it to be available in case people have questions.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-mm-mm.

[Speaker 2]
What's Telegram talking about? Oh, my gosh.

[Speaker 1]
That's funny. Some breaking news in Texas. I imagine Winston's for the burn.

I don't know. Maybe we'll weigh that. Maybe we'll weigh that and present that and see how everybody feels about that.

Might be good to do for the new year. Help start a, you know, fresh start along with the baby FJB for the baby burn.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe we'll un-Gulag Diesel since he's being so cute.

[Speaker 1]
Is Diesel egg? Is egg like the nice Diesel and Diesel like the not-as-nice Diesel? Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Yes. I hope everybody had a good Christmas. I think this will be a much better year for us.

Happy New Year. It's Danny. Mm-mm-mm.

Mm-mm-mm. Diesel says, I'm just a gremlin. Cute at day, naughty at night.

All right, if you say so.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-mm.

Carrie B. says, when do we get to enjoy Grant's visionary leadership once again? I don't know.

What are you looking for? Franks? You're looking for somebody to eat franks on the camera?

You can just go hop on to CC coin. I'm banned from it, but I'm sure it still exists. Can't believe I got banned from there.

I've never been banned from a show. Here's to mooning in 2023. Only excited for this new year.

And it's, I mean, this is, I don't know. I don't know about you guys, but stuff in my life has always happened like this. When I'm like super, super excited about something and like feel like it's going to be blown out of the water is when it's like turns out into meh.

And then the times I have lower expectations is kind of when stuff all happens. So I really hope that's exactly what happens here.

[Speaker 2]
I think it'll be amazing.

[Speaker 1]
We've never had more people awake to everything going on than now. So that's something.

[Speaker 2]
That's pretty cool. I have to click on Jeff's. Oh, I get it.

It's like, why does he have a peanut butter as his picture? Maybe he really likes peanut butter. But I get it now.

[Speaker 1]
The FJB dollar identifies as Benjamin and do not forget it.

[Speaker 2]
What is that?

[Speaker 1]
Lemon drop. I don't think I've ever seen that. We have some other like ones they sell in the mason jar, but I think that's a different brand.

I think that's called like moonshine. Z money, when are you going to tell us where you're at so we can send you a real lemon drop? But make sure you don't go to a place that's like, what was grants like $30 a drink?

Because we're all broke right now. Remember? Drop.

Half tub shine. What the heck is that? They also have a cafe espresso.

Apple pie. Yeah. The other brand has apple pie too.

And they have a peach too. Peppermint. Banana fosters and pina colada sound good.

Vanilla bean sounds good too. Ooh, habanero. That might be good for like a, well, I guess it wouldn't be a margarita.

Oatmeal cookie. I used to make these oatmeal cookie shots that were so good. Ooh.

Baby FJB just got another 10K burn. Wow. So for every one of these, they're matching it too.

So that's actually a 20K. I think. Let me confirm.

I want to confirm that it's not like a 5K.

[Speaker 2]
That's amazing. That's pretty fun.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. It is. It's 10K plus matching another 10K.

So same with the ones I've said before, I imagine. There was a thousand and then a 50K and that's a 10K. Awesome.

That's pretty fun. By the way, if any of you are celiac, Trader Joe's has like a frozen gluten-free pizza crust. It's not terrible.

And then you put, you make your own pizza on it. Not bad.

[Speaker 2]
I have to type to Z-Money because I don't think he's in the boys.

[Speaker 1]
We got to see where he's at. I still got to send him a lemon drop. Do you guys remember when he sent Grahams and his girlfriend a lemon drop?

So I feel like I owe him a lemon drop.

[Speaker 2]
That's a bug.

[Speaker 1]
Z-Money. Diesel says, how do we know Boris still loves us? I promise I am working on that.

Trust me. I would copy and paste and screenshot my entire conversation with Boris. If I could, because it's clear that a lot of people literally don't even know or realize, or, you know, or think Boris may have walked away.

And I understand. I understand why you would feel that way. Trust me.

But to Boris being one so busy, one so high profile, one so about liability as an attorney, I feel like this is my complete opinion. I feel like he thinks that's insane. Like, really?

People think I'm not there. How would I still have my name on everything? And that's, again, completely my opinion.

Z-Money hasn't replied. I feel like he already started drinking those lemon drops.

[Speaker 2]
Nosey money.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like he's already drinking that lemon drop. Sorry, my sister just text how the other birds were doing, because I have two other parrots. And the girl who's, like, my other bird's girlfriend, because she's also an African Grey, she was crying yesterday and this morning.

Super sad. Everybody spam tag Z-Money. Oh, wait, that's at the store.

That has to be at the store. There's no way that's his pantry. Unless Z-Money is, like, an alcoholic, a very functional alcoholic.

That really likes those. So maybe he's, like, in line checking out.

[Speaker 2]
Start tagging him.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe I can call the grocery store and buy him one. Well, I don't know if they do that, because you need an ID. Don says, so how or where do we send coins to burn?

Don't know the process. Moku, could you please reply to that? I think he has the address on hand.

He can help you with that. There he goes. So, I'm imagining you send it to that address and then let Moku know so he can match it.

So, I'm imagining you send it to that address Is that correct? Ed, what's your suggestion? Yes, sir.

I'm always open to suggestions. I hope you guys know that. Suggestions.

Wow, I've had a whole glass of wine. I hope you know that. So, feel free to always put those in general chat or DM them.

We've actually gotten a ton of very, very constructive suggestions. And I was going to say constructive criticism, which we have, which has been amazing. Teamwork makes the dream work, baby.

Sounds corny, but it's kind of true. It's very true. It's kind of how the world runs too, you know.

Everybody is an expert at something. Whatever is left to burn of the 5 million that baby FJB will burn. FJB put it in to the 5 million.

What? Whatever is left. Sorry, I'm really trying to follow.

To burn, okay, of the 5 million. I'm assuming that's the matching ones. FJB puts it in.

Oh, I see. So, you're saying if they only burn, like if they only get from the community 3 million, FJB will put towards that? Yes, it says.

Moku, how much do you have from the community so far out of that 5 million? So, Moku says they have about 72,000 so far. My only issue with matching that, we'd have no problem matching that, is I just don't want to be out of funds to pay our bills like very, very soon.

That is the only issue I have with that. Otherwise, I'd totally be down for that. Zmoney, where you at?

What if Zmoney is like on a first date?

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna type this down. Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 1]
Diesel says, any talks with Bannon to get him on voice also? You know what, Diesel? I'm gonna un-Bannon, or I'm gonna un-Gulagi.

Because you're too cute. Let's go in here. Let's find Diesel.

But, to answer your question, we are open to getting anybody. Bannon, Boris, whoever wants to get on. Diesel, we'd love to have Diesel on.

There we go, we un-Banned, or un-Gulaged Diesel. He's almost as cute as Egg. I made brisket today.

It turned out very well, actually.

[Speaker 2]
But we're almost out of the cow we just bought like a few months ago.

[Speaker 1]
Let's do it, Diesel. Come on, voice. We all want a Diesel voice.

I bet you that poll would be 100%. I could use a tutorial on how to send coins to Burn. Could he show us using his screen?

You could probably record something really quick. Have you ever sent coins to anyone, Dawn? No.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Dawn, are you in Trust Wallet? Or what do you use as your primary wallet?

You have an app, okay. So, from your app... Let me grab my phone.

Mm-mm. Because, honestly, I don't use the app often, but I also don't trade FJB, so... Excuse me.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-mm-mm.

[Speaker 2]
What is FJB's New Year's resolution?

[Speaker 1]
Diesel is asking. I don't know. You guys get to tell us.

You get to tell us and vote on it. So, Dawn, if you go into your app and click on FJB when it shows your wallet, then you're going to click Send. And then when it says You Send in that first box, you'll enter the amount.

And then in the destination, what you'll do is copy and paste the address right here. This address. That Moku included, which is just a burn address.

And then you'll just hit Send. And that should be it. Just make sure you get the amount correct on there so you don't send what you don't want to send and you send the right amount.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
You can send... Dawn, you can send Moku a message if you don't mind. Because he's the one matching it.

Tag him here. Or I'm sure you could just tell him in the general chat, too. He's tracking it, he said.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
Go to the gym, get buffed. I already go to the gym. I'm already buffed for as little as I am, Diesel.

I'm just kidding. I know we're talking about FJB. Burn coins like calories, FJB New Year's resolution.

Well, I was just asking about that, but nobody answered. Well, no, I think Wilson answered about if we should do one big burn.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, my God, I'm just laughing right now because I just now read Diesel's message and Gulag saying he's too pretty for jail. Hmm. Now we have to see a selfie if you're going to claim that.

By the way, Lucas never sent me an invite to the side chat. Rude. And I haven't seen Lucas since I asked him for an invite to the side chat.

And I'm kidding, by the way, when I asked for that link.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just checking Telegram and Pierre is saying we really need a new roadmap. Team is all gone. Path is different now.

Yes, absolutely. We just don't want to make any false promises, so we want to make sure that management, upper management is on board with everything before just falsely or blindly making a new one. Pat, what is Pat saying?

[Speaker 2]
Let's read this.

[Speaker 1]
Pat, is this from an AI? Is this something an AI wrote or is this you? Something you, who wrote this?

Diesel, Diesel, you gotta like act nice for a little bit when you come out of Gulag. Like, pretend. By the way, did you guys see we got our verified checkmark on Twitter?

Pretty cool. I gotta go look at it again just for good measures. That looks pretty nice.

Hoping to get better engagement that way. Let's see. I wonder, I wonder if that had to do with our engagement.

Coming up a little bit. Although we've had a few good other posts too. There you go, Moku's making you an offer, Diesel.

[Speaker 2]
That's what happens when you're out of jail.

[Speaker 1]
You don't get into jail. Sherlock can tell you a little bit about that. Don't break the law and you probably won't get in jail.

I've heard that's the way it works. Winston's so quiet and then he throws in something really funny.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, see, money. Let's bug him again.

[Speaker 1]
Here's a lemon drop.

[Speaker 2]
I told him we can pretend he's famous if he's like on a first date. That'd be pretty funny.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Any more questions before I get off here? Checking my email.

Nobody's email does. I think everybody's literally just out of the office. Which makes sense.

If you're going to be out of the office, you may as well do it during the slowest week or two. Alright. I think that's everything.

Don't forget, if you do want to burn any coins, go ahead and DM Moku or JL Young or me or just tag one of us in the general chat. I'm sure that'll work too. Thank you all so much for joining.

Again, I didn't do an announcement on purpose just because I didn't have any real updates for you so I didn't want to waste your time, have you come on here for nothing, but just wanted to be here for anybody that did want to hang out or anybody that did have any questions. I hope I answered everything that I could. Thank you all so much.

Appreciate your time. I hope you had a Merry Christmas and are enjoying all this time with family. And I wish everybody a Happy New Year.

I'm sure we'll talk tomorrow before the New Year is over. And of course, I'll be in chat. You all have a wonderful night.

I'll see you in general chat. Thank you.
