All right, happy Tuesday. Thank you for your patience. I had some team texts Okay Yeah, happy Tuesday.

Yes, I am recording Make sure it's going it is 15 seconds Awesome. So we've been going back and forth as you know with The third party and we think we have everything we need We have gone gosh, I don't even know how many departments at this point. I Want to say we're up to five But we the team feels we have a Solid enough answer that we're looking for so Deb will be starting the work best case scenario Everything works exactly how the third party Has Confirmed that it would worst case scenario is That it wouldn't and the dev will just need to continue with more work where we have we already have You know the plan be already planned out I'll keep you updated through the process a this was estimated by the dev at 40 hours I'm not sure if some of the changes or the that the third party has Kind of shared with us if that will change the timing but we will know by the end of the day So I'm very excited about that and we are ready to move on We will get that estimate today from the dev and he will start working on that We'll keep you updated on the process I'm not expecting it to go, you know, super smooth.

I'm sure things will come up and I feel kind of better just Kind of planning for things to come up, but we will work through them and the devil work through them As long as we'll move forward Please just tell us the goals the goal so that that again, that's not gonna change guys I cannot share the task with you. I cannot share it until it's complete until it's live That's not me keeping a secret. That's just that's the way it's gonna work and that's not changing I will share it with you as soon as it's live Yes plan a is what we are moving forward with so Um, okay, that's not gonna work I again the task consists of everything probably Most of everything if not all everything Included in this task is everything that you've all asked for again and again and again for months and months and maybe for over a year So this is not something just Off the wall, this is not some grand new idea.

These are all ideas that We've all compiled together through our months here a Few weeks to get 40 hours of dev work. No, we don't expect that to take a few weeks if everything like I said Best case scenario is he finishes that within a week Worst case scenario again, if we need to if that Doesn't go as planned with you know, if he finishes it and it doesn't work like the third party has insured us it will then we move on to plan B and The downside of that of course would be the dev costs associated with that. But at this point We have all the confirmation we need from the third party.

This has happened before again when we were Originally working on the app. We worked with several on the ramp part like parties instead of Transac We would get the dev would get everything done and we'd go to test it and it actually doesn't work like they You know insured us it would so that's best and worst case scenario but the good point the good news is we'll be moving forward and the dev will be working and Again, if it doesn't work, then we move on to plan B Any new XT news, um, so that's that's a That's also something we're working on and there again, they're also on a China Time zone give me a second here while I pull up their chat Um Last Interaction with them was 8 o 7 a.m. We assume they'll probably be online again tonight my time probably 6 or 7 p.m. That's when all the China Companies come back on but I'll keep you updated Is the dev full-time working for us or is this a spare a few hours here and there The dev is working with us full-time He does have a life and a job like he's a contractor So Sorry Steve, I just got your tag Both my telegram and discord have been working her and very very strange with tags Is this the workaround ever this is still our original dev Yes Few months now actually, so yes, I'm looking forward to it.

The team's looking forward to it Boris is looking forward to it. I haven't talked to him in a few days actually Yeah, very excited to move forward and again, we'll get it figured out Website redesign as well. Um, we're having Actually, it's a we're The company we deal with actually got sold In the past few months and they said they're having some internal issues But they're working on getting everything fixed or I mean our website is 100% working But there's some stuff going on in the background, but it has nothing to do with us Personally just some changes on their end Okay, that's just you know how stuff works everybody goes through Okay, yeah, so that's all I have I am definitely excited to move forward We'll keep you updated again, we have the best case scenario worst case scenario, I think the good part And the takeaway is we're continuing to move forward and the dev I think is Beyond ready to start working So let's As usual, please DM me or tag me if there's anything you all need Remember don't change or don't share your keys Or log into any shady links you're sent and don't send any money to anybody pretending to be me or admins or anybody Pretending to be them. I think it's still on a good streak Nobody's gotten scammed for a while But DM me or tag me if you need anything else.

I Should have another update for you by the end of The day it's only three o'clock here well 341 Sorry if my fans super loud it is so hot here Yeah, I'm hoping to have an update for you all type it up as an announcement by the end today But I'll keep you updated either way We are definitely I think everybody's beyond excited to move forward Seems I don't see anybody typing Have a question in DMs Do you know if the devs will add commas to the FJB and other cryptos of the later update? Oh, okay I'm assuming under the available Yeah I Thought we've done that before but they may have they may have changed it again because of the way it worked With the aligning because then you have the Like the FJB or the Bitcoin on the left and then the value on the right I Think when we tried that just spread them too far and made two lines of it, but yeah that'll That's that's the super easy stuff I Think that was the only question in DMs All right, I will get there's recording up Sorry, I know it's a I think it's an hour earlier than usual but Trying to get to dinner With my parents, so yeah, I'll get this posted right now.
