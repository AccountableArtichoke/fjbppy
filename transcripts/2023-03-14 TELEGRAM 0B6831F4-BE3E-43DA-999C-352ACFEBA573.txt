[Speaker 1]
All right, there we go. Awesome. Happy Tuesday.

Thank you for joining me. So, hey! I actually had take down the CCP plane too for the last like several minutes, but I forgot to unmute myself because I started it a bit early so everybody could join.

But yeah, thank you all for joining me. It has been an amazing day along with yesterday. We got everything finalized.

So we are definitely rebranding, which is huge news. I think that'll be amazing for everybody, for the app, for current holders, new holders, and finally get us approved for some vendors online or booths in real life. So super, super exciting.

I think we'll have um down with the CCP coin now. So I think we'll have super, I think we'll make it super fun and take, so we already have a list of names we're considering, but I think we should ask the community and kind of have a little bit of fun with it. So we'll get that all planned out tonight and have something in announcements tomorrow.

And I think the community should have some input in this to rename the app. I think this is going to be great. And I think we can also go ahead and change the logo.

I think that'd be a great idea. We can take somewhat of a vote on that. Not like an official vote, but see what you guys think.

I'm with changing the logo, but we'll see what you all think. I think it would be a great idea and a fresh slate. Um So yeah, that'll be fun.

Next up we have everything else that got approved that I cannot unfortunately share with you because it's very time sensitive. So this will be shared as it goes live and it is huge. It is everything you've been asking for.

It covers so many changes and I think you all will be beyond happy. That was 100% approved. We are going through with it.

But like I said, unfortunately, we cannot announce that or even give any hints until it is live. So I think that's super exciting. We are still on track to get that done before March is over.

Um of course if there are, you know changes or as far as time wise that we can't control then I will keep you updated on that. But as of now, this is all absolutely comfortably possible to be completed and announced before the end of March. So I'm super excited for that.

I really am. I'm super excited to share that with you all. Um let's see question public square.

Yes, we are already on there. But since we we we are listing on public square did get actually approved quite a bit ago, but since we are rebranding we kind of let that sit there. Super excited for that.

When live we really really hope right now everybody we have um, sorry, I really cannot share any details around that but everybody involved is saying that this is possible to still be completed by quarter one the end of the month March. But I will keep you updated on that and we will announce that as soon as that's live. This I think this is huge.

Again, everything you've been asking for it includes so many changes. Be great for the app, for the coin, for current holders and future holders and I am so ecstatic and I am so so so happy that it got um approved. Because I really think it will be uh in the best interest of everybody.

So did she slip? I don't know what that means. Rebranding of app, shill app, coin stays fjb is what I'm gathering.

Um, I will let you know. I promise I will let you know, but we will like I said, um go ahead and make this kind of fun as far as the rebranding for the app and see if you guys I'm, not sure what you guys feel how you feel about the logo. I know a lot of people have said let's go ahead and switch that out.

How are the new devs going? Awesome. Still going back and forth.

Um as Sorry, hold on. Oh work Call, let me text back. Oops, okay.

There we go. Um, so yeah. I vote fuck Joe Biden coin.

Yeah, well, you know, we just got to strategically change things around, right? We know that's what we stand for but you know, he's out the door. F him, but I think a better way to say F him is to go for what we believe in.

And a little bit more mainstream to get more people on board, right? I know a few of the names. Um, we have Patriot Pay.

I'm not sure if you guys like that. Um, we have What else do we have? I think that's on top of the list right now, actually.

But we'll go ahead and definitely ask for your input and then like I said the logo. I know I've heard mixed reviews about that, but I feel like most everybody has wanted a new logo or is down with a new logo. Any update on misplaced funds?

Um, no updates that I can share on that. Uh, there are some updates. I will let you know.

I promise as soon as I can share. Don't want to get in trouble for that. Are they doing updates on app behind the scenes?

Um, they are still in the strategic phase of everything we got approved for so That's all I can say on that. Uh Is new's going to be good enough to heal old wounds? Oh, yeah.

I definitely think so. Absolutely. I 100% believe that.

Um, Yes, I can't wait to share that. Flute already fucked that up. I don't know.

What did flute do? Let's stop. Please, please, please.

Let's stop the whole discord versus telegram thing. Just leave each other alone. Okay?

Just you know Leave each other alone. We have so much going on. I am so so excited.

Um, I can't wait till we can Share this. I think you all will be ecstatic once it's live. It's literally it's everything You've been asking for this includes it's a package that includes so many changes And i'm just so happy about it Are there new influencers coming on board?

That is not at the top of the priority list right now Yeah, but definitely, um, that's definitely in Uh the plans but that is not not on the top of the list right now But I will let you know as soon as uh, you know, the first thing first is getting the new um Name out for the app and we have we have um different Options for that right so we can stick with fjb and change that You know the freedom jobs business change that into something else.

I My opinion is to change it completely into a completely new name But again, we'll see what you all think we'll make it fun We'll get your input and make sure that it's something the community. Excuse me. Oh my gosh Uh that the community wants I think you guys deserve to have that uh input Um, what would make america great coin, okay The new advisor since last friday has been absolutely amazing.

Um With not only his input but getting us some contacts I feel great about that super super super nice guy, too Um, but again, I will I feel really awful. I wish I could share more with you. But with the nature of the update, um Yeah, we just can't announce it until it's live Contacts or context contacts As long as it's not donnie, no Uh re-invite to discord what did you get?

Okay, we got a we got a few uh, we'll get the discord telegram issue handled This will not be going on but stop calling each other names and you know, stop calling each other whatever Fags or what have you? Um Does advisor have something to do with getting everything agreed to I don't think so. Maybe We've that's been in the process for quite a bit Do you think we will see regular war room segments, um, I definitely think so that's the goal.

Um, that is the goal once We get our uh rebrand and everything completed and I think you'll understand why Thanks for doing this, oh, you're welcome always Make it fair one telegram one discord Somebody told me on discord or dm me today that they don't have telegram like okay. Well, you can listen to the recording then One for each And By the way, let's make sure my recording's going because I have to restart it Yeah, it is Oh, that's cute puppy, I miss my puppies i'm not home Uh, yeah, so let me know if you have any questions I am Again, i'm very sorry. I wish I could share more.

Um, but really there's just no way to share it until it's live. So But it does include so so so many changes. Um I really don't I can't think of one person that's going to be unhappy about this change.

Um I really can't. Yeah So what's better than burn I can't answer that Or maybe it includes a burn. Hey Maybe it includes that that's that's the hint right there ed Maybe it includes a burn.

It is it is an entire package of multiple things Jan will be happy colored me shocked. I'm sure swiggety. Yeah swiggety.

Maybe I think swiggety Swiggety is also clear bear and also like so many Jan, I don't know Jan diesel, maybe they'll be happy for like a few hours and then they're gonna find something Bernie sanders. Yeah, that's probably uh, john anthony's like other The return of eric finman the world's oh eric finman's actually so helpful Honestly, he is good good, man A great man, I actually get a ton of dms asking about uh finman all the time And he truly is an amazing amazing human. I talk to him at least once a week probably Edgy is always happy.

We'll just be turning the happiness up Ed and his sister are actually very nice people Hmm Multiple can you count multiple on one hand? No, I cannot it is uh more than I'd need more than one hand to count multiple in this instance Is new advisor aaron finman, no We can all celebrate jan's 19th birthday on the fjb boat cruise. Oh i'm down with that I'm gonna do cruise.

I've never been on a cruise actually Love fin. I know me too So does his marijuana dealers what? Stop it be nice And there's one man, he's he's a good person I promise And and so many of you know that because the people who know that are in my dms Mm-hmm Any more information on the guy that said he had 200 million coins stolen because of his mom I have not heard back from him I've not heard back from him.

Um But yeah, that was very unfortunate because those coins got sold but we did see That what was it? Was it like 65 million coins were also moved to that same Wallet That would be the scammer wallet or what we were told was a scammer wallet, right? Had another 65 million coins transferred there from another version one wallet Correct.

Is that what you guys got too? I'm, pretty sure i'm thinking the right numbers. Yes.

Okay. So everybody kind of saw that it's a beautiful thing about blockchain Um, and then they dumped so Very interesting, um, actually, you know what? Let's check on that Oh Surin's online.

Hi She's on discord Who's talking to Surin who gave her? the deets Let's see, what was his telegram I am slowly catching up on dms. Um, i'm really sorry if I haven't gotten to you guys Volunteers because i'm a little bit buried So, oh shoot, what was his I think it was like avery or something let's search for him Two down my hmm.

I don't see it Uh-oh Did he did he delete me or block me on uh, telegram? Yeah, I don't see him or did he change his name did he change his name anybody know Oh, yes, he did change his name, okay, let's see Let's see, oh Um, interesting, okay. Well I got uh, Well, let's see i'll send a friend request how about that So we'll we'll find out about that i'll let you know but again just to reiterate Please don't give your seed phrase to anybody not ever not to me Not to anybody pretending to be me if boris texts you don't send it to boris.

Okay If fanon texts you don't send it to him Um, you know, whoever your best friend. I don't care p6 nolan sam ed tim if anybody dallas sends You know asking for your seed just please don't share it even if it's your mom There's no way i'd give my mom her seed phrase. Just don't you know Even jesus, I wouldn't give it to jesus.

Jesus does not know your seed phrase Just you know, just don't but I did. Um, I did mean to check with him because maybe what happened is that he actually Had a different wallet under his metamask extension. Like maybe he did that.

I don't know, you know, I try to think The best of people but either way we did not you know, we cannot compensate you if you do get scammed So just don't share your seed phrase Um, if you ask for us to reimburse you that eight percent we also cannot reimburse that i'm really sorry if we did that You know, there's people that get scammed here more often than we'd like then we'd have to do that with everybody, right? so And unfortunately, that's the community's money really so That's money we'd rather uh spend on marketing and everything else Do not send them to sam even though he's telling you to Pew pew patriots and wokeness patriots and war.

I don't like that. Actually. I don't know if that's a bit long but Jesus take this heat Breeze Goodness Dallas says it's only going to be eight percent a couple more weeks, right?

Hey, we will uh keep you updated. I think that's that's that's going to be the least of your worries. I think Tax change coming with big announcement.

I think so Um Win free bernard. Oh, I will do that as soon as i'm off the call we will have uh, We need you know, we need a heart to heart on this discord Uh telegram little war, you know, nobody call each other fags respect everybody, you know I know don't like everybody. You don't have to like everybody just respect everybody You know just ignore them.

If you don't like somebody just ignore them If somebody's calling you stuff ignore him russ is calling me all kinds of names in the gulag on discord I just pretend he's not there. I love him. He's like little brother.

He's probably older than me actually maybe big brother, whatever But you know, everybody's high on emotions. It's okay What is the hat let's see license the purchase What is that The purchase is oh, that's awesome. Did you close on that?

Um, will lp get locked with announcements, uh, yes, absolutely. That's the plan Oh, okay avery accepted my well, he's now a different name 305 guy Let's see. Let's resend my message to see if he knows the whole meta mask situation 200 million Let's see any other questions I mean we can do it right now.

[Speaker 2]
Let me see.

[Speaker 1]
Is he actually banned? I know, uh Flute has been kicking people. Let's see Let's look at fans we did wipe the discord we'll have to wipe telegram I don't remember if there's a way to wipe telegram.

I know we could make an auto 24 hour delete but Let's look at fan. Oh Avery. Oh, yeah, I did.

That's weird. Well, you're not banned nolan At least from my end the last, uh person banned on the server was this guy who got scanned Uh re-invite, well you can okay, you could just click on the same. Let me see On the same link Nolan, how's the girlfriend?

Is she a wife yet? Is she a fiance yet? Oh working on it Oh, is she in here did you invite her are you like you're not going to be around these, uh Degenerates She's playing with rocks what Oh my gosh, it's getting serious that's exciting I keep my degenerate identities.

I read she doesn't even know about us. Oh my gosh. That's that's gonna be my goal That's actually funny ed said nolan looking to share seed asap Oh god Oh, I shouldn't have laughed at that.

[Speaker 4]
Oh my goodness.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Let's see. I thought I had Nolan in my dms, but you guys have been like blowing up.

Let's see There's bernard Um We're gonna have little robot nolan babies in here soon. Oh, that's gonna be so cute Uh, the changes give some use to the coin Yes, absolutely. Like i've said before that stayed uh, pretty consistent a lot of our original plans.

I think are staying um, we would love to add donations to Uh political candidates, I think that'll be amazing just a lot of legalities, uh surrounding that So basically Uh, that will be a lot of ways and hey, you know what? It might be fun to get on and kind of brainstorm with the community even uh with the legalities on political donations um We're brainstorming So we already have kind of a few I don't want to say loopholes But a few ways, uh to go about that So maybe that's what we'll do too is we can start sharing that and get the community's input and all that I don't know if that'll actually be better through announcements versus voice chats just to get that kind of all in writing And it's better or easier to save um And review that way Um But yeah, let you know When transacts stop ignoring me, oh, let me know what is the deal with transact My children won't know the internet exists. Yeah, i'm with you on that if I had children, they wouldn't know the internet exists same with like School public school.

Nope When can I buy my pillow on the app we're working on that we got to start with the rebranding so He could let us in you know in the my store Or call zuggerberg if you need advice for loopholes Loopholes are what liberals have been using for years time for us to do the same Still disabled account on transact. Oh, uh, do you mind sending me? A dm just to put it on the top of my inbox, please Nolan I did send you the uh discord invite.

I see you haven't opened it though Thank you. Just to put it on the top for some reason I think I need to clear out my telegram like I get a bunch of these groups that I get invited to or added to I don't know and they take up like a lot and now a lot of my um Dms are going into the archive chats And a lot of times I don't see them there. So Um There are people waiting for transact to refill yes, um, you know what That's been on our list.

The nice thing about transact is they actually are very very Let's get that on our list They're very responsive and they are very open to Really doing anything to kind of that helps them or us out So let's go ahead and what i'll do Is try to schedule a meeting with them And see what we can do on that How much time have you planned for the rebranding end of march starts some things But surely it will take time to complete.

Yes, absolutely um right now Really our biggest time constraint now that we got everything is going to be on Uh other parties That are completing the hard work but uh as far as like obviously a name a logo we will Start that asap. We just got the approval really between between yesterday and today. Um So yeah Why did we wipe discord we'll be wiping telegram tonight to uh I just gotta look.

I don't know if there's a way to wipe telegram or we'll just have to start doing 24 hour wipe Um because we are starting brand new that's another hint Sanitary reasons Can we still buy without transact with the change yes change now still works um Was I right about the wait, what was the 315? What was the march 15th prediction?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. That's what i'm waiting. What was the prediction?

[Speaker 1]
Beware of ideas in march i'm so confused All right, what else Oh, let's see, I think this camera Let's see Ultra mega patriots No one says I can't give away all my secrets now, can I what the heck does anybody know this march 15th March 15th date I was unaware Mm-hmm Tomorrow community gets to start voting for app name changes. Uh, yeah, I think I think what we should do We'll see I think we should first take Kind of let's start like maybe polls, I don't know we'll think about some way to make it fun But let's start with just ideas. Maybe we can make it even a contest Um, like I said right now The top of the list is patriot pay um But again, that's not finalized by any means So I think we should still maybe take Suggestions from the community because you guys have a bunch of great ideas.

I think patriot pay is kind of like It's not you know, it's like it works a little bit for normies, too Um, but you hear it and you kind of know what that means like patriot pay right? It's almost like apple pay paypal um Kind of sounds like that, but the patriot it's it's very simple. It's to the point.

Um So I think that's kind of why that one's on top of the list And it's uh, it's not too far To the right and it's not too far to the right that we wouldn't get accepted into events or on other vendors websites Patriot pay only makes sense if it's going to be used to pay for things Well Me too it implies a broad platform not just a coin. Yeah, I I think um I think that's pretty You know Ah bees With himalaya coin takeover Okay Oh, i'm, sorry, I hope i've been uh reading questions loud enough I am sorry The idea of march and my son's an absolute crazy person birthday Wait, it's your son's birthday Didn't somebody say was that yesterday or today? Jb said it was his wedding anniversary.

Maybe it was yesterday. My days are all blending apart Oh Hey, maybe uh, maybe you could pay for ads Just ask another son On the second, oh just have another son. Oh, that's so cute Oh my gosh Oh That's adorable everybody having babies Happy wednesday.

Gosh, nolan's about to start having babies Hmm let's see Freedom justice patriot coin.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
That sounds nice Oh my gosh Oh, they're so cute Oh my goodness your kid looks like a doll No, baby That's cute Had a daughter february 3rd, yeah, keep having a bunch of kids we need uh, we need more normal ones who know what their gender is Have a bunch of babies. Oh my gosh, I could not get over that picture and my hair So cute looks like a little gerber doll a little gerber baby Oh quick summary of important points, um Everything we've been waiting for got Approved And We should have everything's on track the new the changes that I can't announce unfortunately until they are live um because Just with schematics and everything. I really there's not really a way to announce it until it's live.

Um, it would screw everything over um That is on track to be completed by the end of march Uh, yeah That's I think the important parts, um for as far as the rebranding that is the part that I could share We are definitely 100% doing that And we will be taking community votes I will write. Oh, let me mute We the people I can't hear because I have my um sound off so sorry um So waiting on devs and stuff was approved. Yes, absolutely We're waiting on the devs now And then um, I will go ahead and type this up type just the important summaries because I know Our voices have been kind of long.

So I know you all just want to get to the point sometime. So i'll do i'll type that up in an announcement afterwards Patriot coin and gross Yeah, that kind of reminds me of like how liberal parents spell their kids names, you know, they try to get creative it's the the names like sarah and they're like c y r a y It's like your kid's name's sarah, why'd you spell it like that but they need to be so different love you though It does like I get it because the pay part but you know Oh my gosh They just end up making future strippers Oh god I get the feeling people don't like it True nothing personal. I think it just that's like what liberals do they it's very creative I get it, but I think because they've ruined that for everybody else They ruin a lot of things for everybody else and then it just kind of ruins it If it weren't for that, I think it would be like, oh, that's cool But it's because they've changed Like chris is spelled k-r-y-s like your your kid's name is chris what True let me see if this guy minds Okay, so yeah apparently Apparently Apparently with this scammer guy, I guess the scammer also transferred his mom's coins So we don't know but that's apparently what happened. I just heard back from him um Again, just a reminder don't you know, we don't know what really happened or what we don't know the details You know blockchain can only tell us so much but just don't share your seed phrase with anybody not even me not nolan not sherlock Nobody nobody that you know, not your mom. Not your dad.

They don't need their seed phrase. Don't give them their seed phrase My mom definitely doesn't need her seed phrase Okay So, okay, we'll do that. We'll see if you all have any other ideas as far as an app uh name Like I said the top contender so far is patriot pay um, but We're not opposed to other ideas and that's not set in stone by any means So maybe it's nice to have a few ideas and just go from there as always just know That bnb will have the final say so, you know If we do get other ideas and they don't go through just understand that it seems like everybody kind of actually likes patriot pay Which I I do too Um, we'll have to figure out The logo situation, I don't know how you guys feel about that Um, I know most comments i've seen are people wanting a new logo uh but That could just be You know coincidence with the comments i've seen also because I agree with that. So maybe that's why um Who came up with patriot pay I will have to check because we've had that one On our list for quite a while like, uh several weeks Probably not a blue a blue logo democrat blue. Yeah, I have heard that before and especially like teal it just seems like Freedom exchange.

Oh, that's kind of a nice one, too Actually i'm going to send that in Let's see Freedom exchange that sounds pretty nice. I like that That might be a freedom exchange versus patriot pay Okay, i'll add that to the list True True I like that. That does sound nice has to be red white and blue.

We can definitely do that. So the issue with having the logo Not be red white and blue or not be A usa flag per se is because bnb really wanted to make fjb um into a global Coin and a global app and we do have a lot of international users already um No one's funny tonight no one said it'd work in france still true a few other countries too, I think um So that yeah, not blue and yellow. I actually hate the blue and yellow combination and way before ukraine um But that's that's why we don't really want the logo being a red white and blue per se um That's why Kind of there But we could like run some kind of fun contest.

Um for the community to Vote on both the name and logo because you guys are super creative so Um, let's see Freedom exchange is global patriot. Not so much. Hmm.

Is that like the consensus? I guess I don't Don't get me wrong It's been overseas but I guess it's it's patriot like to um, I know we have a few several people in here Not from here. I don't know how many on the voice does patriot kind of Sound like american Patriot is that Very much american.

Okay, that's good to know I've never thought of that. I've I would never I would never associate like patriot with american, but that makes sense

[Speaker 3]
Interesting global patriot pay

[Speaker 1]
Now i'm like going to google I'm going to google the actual definition of patriot Okay Not i'm not like arguing with you guys I'm, just curious a person who loves her her country and supports his authority and interest Hmm, I can see that then because it's like very country based Let me see So I can definitely see how that's american then

[Speaker 2]
Come on work. What's what's google doing?

[Speaker 1]
Oh Google says a person who vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies. Wow, okay Okay, I can I can see how that can that's interesting, you know sometimes like words like So I speak I also speak arabic But I only like know the words that my parents spoke in the house So if we ever meet anybody else or like a tv or something like I have no clue what they're saying because I literally don't Know and and my parents speak like they'll throw in arabic words. So it's like half english half arabic kind of thing um So I feel like it's similar to that where I really don't Like don't realize that patriot means is pretty sounds pretty american to the rest of the world Be a patriot and make your country great again I like that the freedom exchange might be a really nice one.

I'll see how uh, They feel let me see Let me see Freedom exchange see how everybody likes that Patriot only sounds bad to the left. I mean i'm okay with that I'm okay with anything that sounds bad to the left I saw this meme the other day. Actually.

It was amazing. I wanted to share in here, but I want to get in trouble And it was like you guys have probably seen it. It's like you What was it now?

I have to find it. I'll find it and share it The new name will be the coin formerly known as fuck True I like that Now we need a freedom bank Maybe that would be nice Freedom can have multiple uses individual freedom freedom of commerce. Yeah, absolutely I absolutely agree.

I do. I really like freedom exchange because I also feel like it'll appeal to the normies and When you hear freedom exchange I'm, not gonna think that's liberal like I am gonna think that's conservative, right? I think for the most part.

I don't know if that's I feel like most of the time I can like feel out what how most people are gonna feel but sometimes I don't Sometimes I am in my little world But I really do like freedom exchange and I don't think we've had that Come up as an option Yes lefties hate words like freedom and patriotic That's a fact Truth too. Yeah. Yep 100 Yep, did you guys see?

Um That we paid twice For uh the wuhan lab, did anybody see that? The left uses the word democracy a lot. Haven't heard them use freedom often.

Oh, yeah 100 Democracy have you seen like the uh news clips where They get like news clips from maybe 15 20 different news stations and they all say the same exact sentence and like it's clear They were sent that to go ahead and parrot it to a bunch of people that are going to parrot it It's amazing I really feel like you can't really there's I don't know. Maybe I have like a radar for this, but you can't really like There's no way if somebody was liberal like pretending to be conservative. I feel like I have like a I would totally feel them out right away.

I totally be like, yep, that person's faking it Threat to our democracy. Yep that you've seen that video then they had like at least a dozen Videos from news stations and they all said like a threat to our democracy threat to our democracy. What does that even mean?

What? Hey, yep Dallas dallas, I cannot say that out loud Oh my gosh That's funny Mm-hmm. Ooh, I think I just got a reply on the freedom exchange.

Let's see. Ooh This is what I got. Are you guys ready?

I said, um, what did I say? I said freedom exchange How do we like that and I got got a nice has a nice ring to it Ooh See you guys already have great ideas Oh Oh I think it's the best one yet. There's a minor cinch search competition, but shouldn't be hard to dominate ooh You guys might be onto something Not sure if the word exchange would make it a higher priority Sec target versus a wallet.

Okay, but we can we can play around with that, right? But there's a some little insider input For you guys So I think it's the best one yet. There's my nurse in search competition, but shouldn't be hard to dominate It's way better than the other two not sure if Not sure if the word exchange would make it a higher priority sec target versus a wallet Which by the way, we already have that cleared with the sec right as far as our coin goes Um, and then has a nice ring to it That's what i'll do maybe is all maybe that's what we'll do Is take you guys's input and then I put it in the um Team chats and then just read the replies can't tell you from who but you know, i'll just just share Wait, I got another one another reply it's ffe fucking freedom exchange Chat Do you guys like this we could do like an hour we could do an hour every week of like a third voice chat That's funny freedom exchange wallet Okay, you might be on to something Who is that from?

I can't say it's from uh Or behind the scenes folks at fjv I can't say but I could read them out to you. I think that's pretty good.

Um, Who had the keys right and bannon and boris took care of it as soon as they were uh alerted again, which was As soon as I came to pay the bills and was told there, you know that we don't have a few hundred dollars to pay The web hosting and the app hosting Um, that's when it came to all of our attention And uh, yeah

[Speaker 2]
That's what we can say about that

So everybody likes the freedom exchange idea more than the uh, patriot pay, huh? freedom Freedom power is to kkk. Jeez don't get us in trouble now people are gonna start saying oh we Said we were kkk Black power coin, but in a good way You just don't want them claiming that we're like white power.

Hey, i'm not very tall though world trade Hmm Trump exchange truth and freedom coin Good thing we have a few days to think about this Unaffable coin, isn't that right? Gosh everything we've been through Matt says he really likes freedom exchange.

Oh, that would coin kind of nice Let's share that let's share that I'm also gonna share Nolan's link in the description Liberty freedom coin Does that seem too long though liberty freedom coin Three syllables or less. Yeah kind of it's like easier to remember, you know, that's a little shorter It's like that freedom coin Life liberty happiness coin No communism coin actually, uh, what was there we had an idea I forget now.

Let me see if I can find it but what sucked Is it would be CC Let me see Hold on. I think it may have been recent Oh conservative crypto So We were brainstorming names In the team chats and yeah conservative coin was one but it was cc so we couldn't We couldn't do it I had to look that up on march 2nd Didn't work out guys, i'm, sorry Freedom culture coin Republic republic coin Republic coin isn't bad Because like well republican but I feel like we might get more than just republicans because there's I don't know about you guys, but I know quite a few people that don't consider themselves Anything, but really they lean way more, right?

[Speaker 3]
Freedom culture coin mcfeely exchange patriot family coin liberation coin It's a joke someone here left the group to make community coin.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's why we can't have conservative coin that would also be cc Constitution coin. Yeah, that's what sucks is it would be cc and we could always add something to it, but Still Populist denarius people's money Uh Anyone ask if you have applied to more events who would show to the event? No, we have been not been denied of so many events and so many websites.

So honestly, I haven't applied to any events and I want to say a month but probably more like six weeks Um who would show up to events we cannot have uh other advisors show up because of their other work contracts in the political world, um So it would be me. Sorry or one of you guys can show up with me. You're more than welcome to But that is the plan Um Meaning of life coin people's coin coin of the people.

Oh, I think um Well, no, it was we the people coin. It was one of you guys one not you guys, but you know one of the holders That was an fjb holder. He started we the people wtp And i'm pretty sure he rugged that but I don't remember don't quote me

[Speaker 5]
Um

[Speaker 2]
But bannon likes that one

[Speaker 1]
Oh, so I see what you did there you did freedom exchange, but it started with the x Instead of the e interesting

[Speaker 2]
Let's see I'm gonna send that little

[Speaker 3]
Graphic here

[Speaker 1]
Let's see Let's see, okay eastwood dollar Lib peck true fight coin vni vital national interest Sounds interesting gop exchange The first rule of fight coin don't speak of fight coin Yo What I miss is the apri brand idea, yes pierre freedom founder coin Pierre the we have runners up Uh, well, okay. So from the actual from the fjb team patriot pay Has been a runner front runner And from the community freedom exchange seems to be the winner We're trying to find somebody something that'll stand out to most everybody a little bit more to normies and not Get us denied into shows yeah, patriot pay, I think a lot of people like that, but Some people were saying it sounds like very usa-based where bannon and boris want to make this a You know worldwide global Sort of app, which is I think where the freedom exchange came from Financial independence coin Who's bruce bane y'all have new names oh it's gen x I say y'all have new names all the time. I can't keep up Who was it? Oh, it was um romeo That text me on discord today and I could not or maybe it was yesterday actually and I could not for the life of me Figure out or remember the telegram handle But to nola's point if the team got into banking would they have trademark issues at the freedom exchange?

Yeah, true Let's see Mm-hmm, they're gonna definitely ask Free money, is that gonna be a liberal coin then?

[Speaker 3]
Liberals love free money. I think so All righty, well, I guess we can kind of keep brainstorming that i'll think of some We'll have some contest I think we should have some contest.

[Speaker 2]
Um Let's see So all parallel economy uses a line pay I'm gonna think of I see several people Uber home on coin Hickory after old hickory.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder who killed the fed the first time. Oh, okay, then. Oh my gosh I don't think i'll share that into team chats Actually, maybe I will I think that will be let's see let's change Just for you bold hickory Um I'm gonna change that see what everybody thinks Was rebranding the app big news anything else, uh, we have big news that a very big Update has been approved.

Um with With multiple updates multiple dimensions of the update Unfortunately, I cannot change uh share it until it is live because of the nature of the update Um, we are still shooting for the end of march if that changes I will let you know You know there are there is a chance that the date will change because we are depending on other parties But I will keep you updated every step of the way i'm just very excited that we did get approved Patriot silk world coin Yeah, whatever bannon wants to chill right I think bannon will feel a lot better showing something.

That's not fjb even though we are all Very fjb world freedom coin. Oh, I like that. That is very worldly American open cartel aocs I don't know if we could do american because we are trying to make it, you know Boats and hoes So name of coin, oh prestigial glide Oh, that sounds professional So name of coin can change but what does this mean for the coin contract name?

Basically, we'll get there once we get there for sure. We are changing the app name at this point So I hope that answers your question Himalayan coin. Yeah, we're just gonna just gonna sync with himalaya and go there Hey, i'm not opposed to that Gotcha app name changing coin name to remain for the time being Uh, yes for the time being if we do decide to change that i'll definitely uh be asking for input on that too So Herald lane, what does that mean?

Herald lane coin If coin name change will that require a fork? Uh, so it Yes, yes and no. Um that's being there's ways around that in a way right because if we're Really pitching this through the gift card and through the app then You know, we can kind of can keep it contained through that.

Um, it would be a little bit of a mess but that's kind of why we're concentrating on changing the name of the app versus the coin because the coin would require a Fork to change the name officially, you know, we can change the name of the coin like in the app um which is fine, but then I feel like that'll be a little bit confusing because what if you have somebody who comes to an event or what have you who is a Crypto savvy and then tries to find us on trust wallet or what have you searching that? Coin name they're not going to find us. So, um, but again Like who was it?

Was it jb? Who said? Who said we should go ahead and you know use loopholes to our advantage?

Um, and again, it's not doing anything illegal. It's not not doing anything not by the book whatsoever We are still making sure we're doing everything correctly the way we're supposed to um, but there are ways to do things, you know to get by And to change certain names and stuff like that and still do things completely illegally American digital bobby jones the golfer Would a fork invalidate any sec, etc approvals that have been received. Uh, that's a great question I'm, not sure about that, but I will definitely ask Because i'm i'm sure if that uh was the case and we would just need to get another um Document Document Oh, let me see bob jones federal prosecutors looking into abandoned backed crypto, so Who found that Who are you Trying to figure out the time difference of when that came out versus when you guys found it So I got that several hours ago I was uh trying to figure out how long it would take you all to find You already knew about that yes.

Yes, I did Come on you think I didn't You If we are keeping the coin freedom jobs and business then it does make sense to call the app freedom exchange Yeah, I like freedom exchange, too. I like both of those. I'm curious to what you all would vote for I get the feeling the abc thing is engineered.

Oh 100. I definitely think so. Um, I got multiple Um attempts to contact me And to get my input on that abc article Yep Good press for us.

I'm the believer that uh, we're so small that I feel like any press will be good press for us to be honest the only thing is this is my thing when I First saw the article Is the only thing is that people who would buy our coin are not watching the news and not reading the news.

[Speaker 2]
I know i'm not Let's see Bob is typing.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see if bob and I have any questions And then I'll get off of here, sorry, I feel like i've kept you all forever But I will um, I will type a summary of just same foreign parts just so I know you all have lives.

[Speaker 3]
You don't have like hours to sit here and listen to us.

[Speaker 1]
Just hanging out That's funny We're recording I missed the first 20 minutes. Yes. I am recording.

I will type up a Little summary of just the main points. I think we only had a few points. We've just been hanging out and chatting but I'll definitely type that up After I get dinner I am starving.

I'm, sorry I'll post the recordings asap. But I can do that on my phone actually probably while waiting for food What People really thought the santas would be more controllable non-conservative. Oh, that's nuts if it's global and scope and not trying to alienate Certain groups.

It should be more abstract. Okay. Sorry.

I've been really bad at reading your questions out loud tonight Please forgive me if you're listening to the recording If it's global in scope and not trying to alienate any certain groups It should be more abstract and conceptual like amazon represents all the product category as okay Uh, yes, I agree. I agree. I agree Which is why So it seems like the so the top contender with the team was patriot pay Um, but i'm learning through the chats that maybe that sounds pretty exclusive to the u.s and bannon and boris have made it a Pretty big point to make this a global currency and global app So somebody and i'm forgive me who first mentioned freedom exchange. Sorry. I didn't catch that. So please let me know uh freedom exchange was brought up and everybody seems to like that one too, and that seems a little bit more global, but um Like we mentioned What we'll go ahead and do I think is have the community vote on it Bnb will ultimately have the Final decision, but I think we can uh, definitely You know help add some of your input in there Warning warning federal agent in the chat. It's probably swan. I'm pretty sure that's one Let's see, let's find out bob jones Remember swan is the one that's uh said he's reporting us all to the fbi Um So what is the larger goal of the project for?

All the participants all over the world based the name on utility or the benefit. Yes um, the larger goal of the project is to be a global project that is uh We've had that for quite several months. Although I know we've had, you know bigger worries Did the gift cards get on the back burner?

No, not at all. Um, actually The team is very happy about gift cards and that entire idea. We Are just waiting to rebrand that is complete gift cards are complete So, uh, it's very exciting.

Very very exciting. But obviously if we're not, um, you know approved to any events Or even online vendors then that's a problem, right? So that's why that was so important I know it took some time, but i'm really glad we got approved and i'm super super excited to uh rebrand and start with a New name and logo All right anything else Dream as in the american dream.

That's a concept that belongs to the world. Oh, that's kind of true I do like that.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not that creative. So you guys have the best ideas
