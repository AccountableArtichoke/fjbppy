[Speaker 2]
Super busy So we'll get right into it to not take too much of your time So for I see somebody I see time to trade Has his question here that he tagged you in I'll retag you but basically everybody wanted a rundown on the technical side of the smart wallet and Just everything you can tell us about that, right? Right, right awesome Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you for explaining that. I know people also noticed last night that their FJB Wallet address changed when they're in smart mall wallet mode versus expert mode Even though the rest of the wallet addresses stayed the same now, I know I haven't actually sent you this question yet So I understand if it's something you need to get back to us on any idea on how that will affect Those who are using their seed phrase and trust wallet Awesome. Well, we're super excited about that Everybody I think is super super excited and I think it'll be even a bigger deal once we have boomers Come on, because we have some people users that haven't been in the telegram or discord Emailing us because they didn't have aetherium and a few even in the chats I think you know that have gotten some aetherium from help from other members, but otherwise we're kind of stuck there Awesome, we're very excited. We're very excited to hear more about that, too I know the users.

I know have some questions here. I'm not sure if you saw the questions from time to build Regarding I tried to tag you as a reply to it. Let me know if you want me to read it Sure He says do do we have a version control system set up as we go to mass marketing or other means of reverting to Previous versions in case of emergency who is trained to use it?

Awesome good to know his second question is as we may have large number of users. How can we stress test effectively?

[Speaker 2]
awesome Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds good. And I know that's from another point of view as far as Bannon goes, you know We don't want to get into another wire situation Not that we think transact would pull the same But basically we don't want to promote this a hundred percent on war room and crash is kind of also why we're going Slower and doing it a lot differently. Oh I think so, too.

Hopefully just you know They just want to start seeing the charts and results understandably, you know But I think we're getting there and we're definitely moving in the right direction and we definitely have You to thank for a lot of that. So thank you for that Definitely appreciate it and I speak for a ton of people who have actually privately even messaged me You know letting me know to thank you for all the hard work. You've put in we definitely appreciate that I don't see I see one last question from Bob.

I know you're short on time He says who else is doing this and how can how can this functionality be promoted?

[Speaker 2]
I imagine he's speaking specifically about the smart wallet Awesome, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Well, thank you so much. I don't think there's any more questions. I know you're very short on time I want to thank you once again for putting up with us and your patience and all the hard work you put in Definitely does not go unnoticed and we appreciate you being here and your patience to keep us moving forward We definitely couldn't have done it without you Well, I can't wait till we you know blow up and that way we can have you as our star up there who came up with all this

[Speaker 4]
Right

[Speaker 1]
Well, we appreciate that and I think other developers actually for you and special ed with the website You know the web developer and also the other developer helping us out with the smart wallet I think both of them came out and said actually the way this was built was brilliant So it makes it very easy for me to go off of So I think that's you know, there's a lot to be said there, too So we definitely appreciate that.

Thank you so much Thank You Velo don't want to keep you for too long I know you got to go have a wonderful night You too Merry Christmas you too, I'm sure I'll speak to you before then But thank you so much for happening on everybody has been wanting you to get on voice and wanted to hear everything directly from you So I know everybody was super excited for the chat. I really really appreciate it Thank you, bye-bye Already Wonderful I hope that answered all of your questions there from Velo I apologize. I know he's been very very busy.

So it's awesome For him to make some time to get on here and answer some of your questions and help explain More about the smart wallet Now Happy Christmas Eve Eve Super excited no margarita today, but I did put a little brown sugar bourbon in my coffee because I just Made another coffee Other updates we have so I'm sure you saw the biggest one, which is the smart wallet live last night huge step We still have some bugs to work out If you get any failed transactions or anything like that, please go ahead and send them my way Our other depth is our other dev is helping with that Now our next step is gift cards, I've got a few DMS today with people wanting to purchase gift cards Unfortunately, I did hear from our gift card devs I believe earlier today or was it last night all my days are just you know Being just all together now either way the gift cards look like they might be taking a little bit more time than Then we thought they would so it might actually be After Christmas, they're shooting for early next week however We are working our amazing graphic designer is Working on actually, I think he already sent me a draft. Yeah, that looks beautiful Working on a gift card graphic That you all can print in case you still want to gift somebody an FJV gift card And then as soon as gift cards are alive, then you can actually go ahead and send them the email So as far as that goes, I think we'll have that graphic latest by tomorrow all finalized And we can do that if you'd like to still get gift cards for anybody. You haven't gotten gifts for um our next up is our donation from the baby FJB FJB donation The three million coins that were donated to our charity wallet.

I Think we have a charity finalized I was supposed to be getting a call from them. Gosh, it's almost 6 p.m. Here today They emailed me this morning letting me know that they'll send me or call me today. I've still not received a call from them So I'll probably try to call them by the end of the day.

We were trying to get that donation out by Christmas I think this is an organization that you all will love and aligns well with our values but I will update you as soon as I have a Confirmation from them, but they were very very excited to team up with us So that's that and I think that's all the updates I have I know there are some bugs going on with transac and Juno Transac and Juno are both aware of these bugs and they're doing their best to work through them I hope this does kind of show that you know in this tech world.

It's like stuff happens That slows us down or bugs happen that slow other companies down it's not just FJB You know life happens The same thing with kind of our gift card devs, you know, it's taking a little bit longer than they thought it would They haven't done this crypto gift card Development before so it's something completely new they're doing for us and just like transac and Juno They're doing something completely new and You know, we got to get through it, but I will update you as soon as I get an update from transac and Juno I also had a little Meeting this morning with I think li-fi is what they're called.

I am waiting on their team chat the Their owner was supposed to start a team chat so I'll Ping him again for that. Although I believe they're also out of India. So might be probably hear from him later tonight I believe it was 9 or 10 p.m. Their time this morning when we had our meeting so that might explain that but that May be some new things happening on our end. The least we'll do is get listed on their Platform which they're very willing to do and said would take about 10 minutes So I think that would be really cool to give us some exposure And go from there, but I will update you as soon as I have updates there Are there any other questions? Russ says if about velo, I'm assuming if he's talking he ain't working back in the hole velo Russ says what is little Sam from church want from Christmas. So his family doesn't Celebrate Christmas They I forget like they were explaining to me for the reasons they don't but he was telling me about some really cool Legos and some really cool spider-man gloves.

He's getting so I think he's told me he'd let me uh, he'd show them to me This Sunday he wears these like spider-man I think Gloves, so I'll take a picture of those and send them to you Russ Ultimate warrior says 17 cents on Sunday. Can't wait. Hey, I'm not making those promises Any other questions, I don't think I got oh I did receive some DMS asking if we're still doing the Purchases of coins straight from marketing wallet.

Yes. Absolutely. I haven't had anybody take advantage of those yet But if you want to please let me know So far we have sold enough coins to be able to pay for the gift cards Which is the $4,000?

I haven't we've already paid Up the first 2,000. I've paid it personally So basically I just need to get reimbursed for that and then we still have another $2,000 to pay at completion but we have sold enough coins to have that covered and Then some change to help pay for our devs and our bills So, I think we should be good As you have noticed we've tried to sell very very slowly To not disrupt the charts, but still be able to fund everything we need to fund right now Any word when B&B might come on maybe I missed that No the last Update so we had them scheduled for I think it was I don't know if it was two Tuesdays ago now Was the last reschedule we had from them and For now, we have nothing rescheduled We are hoping once we get through the holidays That we can get them in here.

I know Some folks in telegram were upset because Nolan got banned from the war room telegram for shilling and FJB link But I did speak to the admins over there and it was actually a bot. So That was just a misunderstanding and then we had a truth social war room account Go ahead and issue one of our members the cease and desist for using war rooms Logo on our banners on our website We'll come to find out that was not an official war room account So grace the CEO of war room Issued the option to contact her I believe by the end of the day yesterday or get war rooms legal involved and I believe they just ended up deleting their comments But that they are the unofficial war room truth social and they clearly had no idea about us So maybe that's a good page to shill.

Maybe they'll actually Retruth some of our posts. So there's some good ideas there as far as Twitter. I know Seems we've been shadow banned We've contacted them a few times still have not heard back.

We are hoping that applying for a blue check mark Helps with that, but you still need to go through an approval process. So we are waiting for that What's funny about that is they charge your card for the whatever it is, I think eight bucks a month before you're approved So you think that they'd wait till you know, you get approved to charge your card, but there we go. So that's that Ed says any update on LP lock white paper and tax before end of year.

Yes, absolutely LP lock we're still a little bit Stuck on so to say But I believe that will still we're still on track for that Same thing with announcing the new tax structure and the white paper we What is taken? Priority is getting the website technical and FAQ pages done But I think again Most of the white paper seems it's gonna stay most of it will stay exactly the same and we continue doing the work to make that Happen there will be some changes obviously as far as The tax structure and the white paper and we will make those changes Along with the roadmap. I think you will be very happy with the tax structure if you're a holder Yes, I don't know do they have rose to actually yes, I think they do have rose I think they're the ones who recommended that to our telegram our robot Got banned by a bot You looking at any dates or events for promotion Yes, absolutely.

I've gosh I filled out so many applications So yes, absolutely Actually what I need to work on is some more graphics which it'll be great because With our graphic designer and then we have my husband who'll be working from home this next week So I think I think I'll make him regret that so he stops doing it But I'll be Remember, I need some like non FJB shirts like a little bit more Normie, you know conservative normie so to say shirts for The in real life events and then we'll also get those on Amazon since our Amazon store Got approved along with some hats and then for you all which I think would be a great idea some Gift cards and or I'm sorry not gift cards We can do those too, but some like Bannon business cards FJB business cards and stickers I know we have some on our Shopify store, but they don't give us the options of Buying them in bulk or giving you that option to buy them in bulk And I know obviously if you want like a hundred or two hundred stickers to stick on every gas station or something like that Stick, you know, wherever it's legal I know, you know, we don't want to be paying three four bucks a sticker for something like that So we're working to get those on Amazon Yes, I know Amazon is not absolutely the best best option But I think for now that'll work So that's something we're working on to Get those out to you With a more reasonable price than print if I can offer us because print if I doesn't offer that option at all As far as like, you know a roll of a hundred stickers or 200 stickers or anything like that Heath says so new downloads will they get smart wallets or will they not have access to smart wallet? I thought you said something concerning this. Yes new users will automatically be in smart wallet mode Absolutely, they can go ahead and switch that toggle to turn it off Buffalo trees tonight Buying contest.

Yeah, let's do it. Let's do one till the end of the year. I Think that's a great idea And don't forget our merch contest is still going on in social media Probably announce those on Christmas Day or the day after we'll also have a storewide sale on at the FJB merch store on Christmas and maybe we'll have it go all the way through the new year Maybe we'll do we'll see what makes sense, but something like 20% off.

I think that should be fine so that way if you Want to buy anything for yourself for the new year or anybody else you can go ahead and order those and get Hopefully a good deal on them And Jay says let's all take a shot. Hey, I'm down. I think I added about a shot in my coffee Hmm Russ is already on it.

Remember when Russ killed the discorders chugging his beer. They thought they were gonna win Hmm What percent take does team take on smart wallet exchange I'm Not sure about that. That's a good question.

I didn't think that the team made anything we've had to refill actually the smart wallet a Few times we're trying to get that number just right But I will ask Velo or our other dev Noman To see if they're they know I'm sure they do but I'll let you know as soon as I hear back from them Let's see, we're still waiting on an update from tranzac I know some of you have been waiting more than 48 hours probably closer to 72 hours now again That is a known bug.

I Imagine they'll get back to me tonight with the time difference or the time zones

[Speaker 3]
See if I have any other questions And my inboxes, but I think everything I got today was regarding gift cards and marketing wallet buys

[Speaker 1]
Chocolate Russians You should try that with peanut butter whiskey Outside of baby FJB are you guys looking at other coins added to the app absolutely Absolutely, yes If you know anybody with a solid coin or somebody that aligns with our values We'll definitely Meet with them and partner up In conversation with anyone right now, no, we are not in conversation with any other coins right now We have Had some conversations and other coins trying to acquire other coins But nothing that would be beneficial to us Ross says wife lips just fell off looking at them drinks.

They do look good. I Used to do like Samoa cookie drinks, so it would be chocolate coconut So delicious Or the banana ones chocolate covered banana so good What's your best guess for full launch only asking for best guess I honestly Have not even thought of that. I think once we get the road map and the white paper um pinned down and as we Start the in-person Um events, I think that'll be a lot more telling and to kind of see how that takes off um, I know I'm, not sure where everybody lives, but I know around here um, we have like fields like you drive by fields and there's I mean there used to be I haven't really seen recently, but that's also because I don't drive much anymore Just stuck at home here on discord and telegram with you all Um, but there's like tables out or there used to be at least tables out with um Folks selling these like fjb shirts and stuff like that Um, so i'm not i'm not above doing that Um, so I think once we have our first event Which is we're really hoping to get our in-person shirts ordered Um again more so like more non-fjb conservative shirts and hats even stickers actually Um, because you get a good margin on those Um, I think that'll be a little bit more telling to see how quickly that catches on Uh, as far as app we're good with a smart wallet just working on the bugs now Um, I know like heath I think is having issues with failed transactions right now. So the dev was working on that earlier And trying to get that figured out but like You heard velo just say that's something we just kind of really have to Grow into we don't want to have another war room announcement and oh an hour in, you know, there's something we crashed But um, I think the devs have done a great job making sure um We don't run into something that bad again

[Speaker 3]
Oh Lake tahoe, huh That looks cozy We were supposed to go up to up north like I think last week and it ended up snowing so we couldn't

So That's they know to do that and velo's like the greatest at that So I appreciate that there's no way I can give you any technical info Um, but I hope you appreciated that. I hope he answered all your questions If you have any other questions for him, feel free to shoot me those and i'm sure he'd happily happily answer them um, thank you for your patience as we keep moving forward Um, we are making sure all of our bases are covered we are making sure to think of every scenario um, we are making sure to think 10 steps forward um, not saying that You know, this means we won't get into Any kind of pickles in the future, of course that happens that's life.

That's business. That's crypto But we are doing everything we can To have less and less of that and go Keep moving forward as smoothly as we possibly can And if we do run into anything, we hope that we are prepared for it That's the goal right now Again, because we know it's not Always a super smooth road so Like I said, we are really doing everything we can to make sure we're always thinking ahead And facing everything in the best way we can Uh, so thank you so much.
