[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, happy Wednesday. Thank you for joining me. I'm trying to re-record the voice from yesterday, Tuesday, because I'm not sure what happened, but I somehow stopped the recording when I changed my headset, it seems like, around that time.

So, I'm sorry for that fail on my part. That's my New Year's resolution, is that and no typos, because I'm the queen of those. I need to start reading what I'm saying before I send it.

Alright, let's get to it. Let's answer some questions. I didn't get, I think I got one question in my DMs. I actually found a few more afterwards, so I can go through that. And the one question I got was, oh sorry, it's gonna be buried now. Okay, question for voice tonight. Can the marketing coins be offered to purchase directly, avoiding the 8% tax on the purchase and thereby getting the money to marketing without price impact to FJB?

Question mark, transfer BUSD or BNB to marketing wallet, then receive FJB. Yes, absolutely. This has been discussed on the last voice or two.

We will do kind of like a friends of FJB, I think Paradox wanted to call it, and have folks who want to buy straight from the marketing wallet to prevent us from needing to sell, which would be really cool. You will have to request that from your primary handle in the chats, just so we know who we're transferring the coins to, but we'll make an announcement with the details. I think that's a great idea, so we appreciate that.

We have been selling very, very slowly in very small amounts to not dump on the charts but still get stuff paid, so I think that's a great idea. Thank you. I think a few people have that idea, so that will be nice.

And then a few of the ones I got were message requests I didn't get to tell later. Any status update on charitable giving? Is that still going on?

Which organizations have received donations so far and how much? We have not made any donations since we found out about our missing funds. We are doing our donations until further notice.

The only donations we are making now are through BabyFJB, and we will have something before the end of the year. Details on that. I'm not sure.

As far as legal, we're still going through that to see if we are required with the way our LLC and coin is set up. If we are required to have a percentage to the go to charity or donations. But if that's not the case, as it stands right now, we do not plan to have that in our tax structure.

That was the point of partnering up with BabyFJB so that they could take care of the donation aspect and the reflections aspect. From the chats, we saw that holders were split on that. Some were very diehard donations and said that's what brought them to the coin.

And some said they'd rather do any donations on their own dime, on their own time, and how they wanted to. Same with the reflections. Some people felt very strongly one way or another about them.

So that way, if you'd like, you can purchase BabyFJB coins and that will take care of reflections and donations. Otherwise, you don't need to. And then there was one more I received.

Hey, Sarah, looking forward to the meeting tonight. Here are my questions. Do you know how much money was stolen, missing?

And how do you know for sure that the money was stolen or missing? What exactly was the money stolen from? Do you know more about how this happened?

Does the team have any insight into who stole it or where the funds went missing? Okay, I think they just accidentally sent that twice. We are not claiming the money has been stolen.

The funds are missing. They did not go to the purpose they were intended for, and that's as far as we'll speak on. As soon as I have more details for you, I will share those.

And I think that answers all of those questions. Where was the money? Sorry, I'm just trying to reread.

The missing funds were from our wallets. The FJB 8% goes to a marketing and charity wallet. Those words being used very interchangeably.

I think the community all agrees that marketing wallet, donation wallet, I think most people are using that interchangeably to mean the 8% and what money of that was intended for marketing, period. So that's where the money is missing to answer that question. But everything else, we will answer as soon as we find out.

All right, I'll go to the chat. It's nice now because we did delete our 24 hour timer on telegram. I don't think we have a need for that right now.

I think everybody still here is pretty decent and we have enough mods to kind of make sure everything is covered. Tim says, does Bannon know we need volume? Yes.

Bannon is very aware. Boris is very aware. They just want to make sure everything is right before we continue.

Again, they see how upset and understand how upset you all are. Now imagine if we add to that. I'm not sure actually the number.

We should take some kind of poll to see what are the active members, holders in here. But I imagine a few hundred, that's usually the number we get for Bannon calls and some Boris calls to actually around the 200 give or take. So now imagine adding thousands to that.

Bannon also realizes when we had the whole fire issue, you know, people were very not happy about that and I don't think Bannon was either. Obviously none of us were very happy about that. But we just don't want to go through that again.

So this is a long-term project for them. I understand the urgency on our part because sorry, my dog is deciding to, I'm not sure what he's doing, get comfortable I guess. So all to say that this is a long-term project for them.

They are not selling the project. They are not walking away from the project and our funds going missing are not scaring them off away from the project. This happens all the time in businesses.

Funds go missing. I'm sure it's not the first time or the last time that Bannon or Boris deal with it and I'm not, I'm sure it's not the first or last time that it'll happen in a business. So rest assured they are both here.

They are both pumped. They have no intention of walking away but to them it's not that they don't care. It's not that they're not making time for this but this is a long-term project for them and they realize that the app is not ready.

We're not ready and they also realize we're in a bear market right now. So please be patient. Take that into consideration.

Again, I understand I'm like 90% down myself if not more. I still need to sit down and calculate it but I'd rather just not. So I totally understand the sense of urgency on our part but just realize this is a very, very long-term project for them.

Let's see. I have to scroll now. So win CNN volume.

Yes, for anybody that can get us on CNN. Again, I will pay you out of my own pocket. How has testing the smart wallet gone?

Velo was busy through the weekend but we have testers on. So very exciting. We'll update you with how that goes.

Has anyone else had an international processing fee in their bank account when buying FJB via the app? Yes, I know. I think it depends on your bank and or bank account.

I know one of my banks, Bank of America, charges I want to say $45 international fee. My Wells Fargo account does not. So I think that depends on the bank and the bank account you have with that bank.

So yes, we will definitely include that, incorporate that so new people coming into the app are aware of this. Also talk to Transac. I know they're working on getting licensing in the US.

So I'm not sure if that will change. So if they're working on getting licensing in the US, I imagine that they will have legal docs to process payments in the US, which that would be really exciting. Actually, yesterday, I didn't write that down.

But I can write that down now. So absolutely. What currency is needed to buy from marketing wallet, USD or BNB?

We'll do a stablecoin. So I think it'll be some form of USD. And I think it'll be easiest probably for everybody to just use change now to send funds over to us.

So but we'll include the all the details in the announcement. Oh, yeah, we did. Then we did the FJB merch winner, which ended up being dog bone who's been volunteering to work on our website.

So that worked out very beautifully. Some good karma there. And he said 12 was his lucky number.

So Z money said he wasn't the winner spin again. I used to Google random number generator. Ultimate Warrior said late votes just came in.

Wants it to be his number. Turok said what was the transit Transac update. So the Transac update, we had the call or I had the call with them.

The guy was very, very nice. The CEO of Transac. He said that if we don't want to wait till quarter one, so we're talking March the latest, that they can have their software engineers build something specific just for us to be able to off ramp.

The only downside of that would we would need to make a volume commitment. And if we don't hit that volume monthly volume commitment, if we don't hit that on a monthly basis, then we would need to pay them some sort of fee to make their time worth it. So he's working on a proposal that he will go ahead and send to me and we'll go from there.

Again, I don't I personally don't think off ramp is such a huge deal because you could just go to BNB and then USD or what have you. But we will see what they say and I will update you as soon as we hear from them. If off ramp was ready, how long until war room question mark immediately question mark.

No, I think we're working on the app, which is very, very important. I think that gas issue is huge. I think that's a lot more important than the off ramp.

How do FJB merch funds benefit the currently all profits will go to paying the bills after we get out of our little debt hole. All profits right now the plan is for them to go to LP. If we have any better ideas, we'll consider those.

But I think LP is pretty solid decision. Marcus said if you have an angry mob, fewer is better question mark. I think that's regarding the Bannon and Boris want to make sure we have everything right before getting this out to a bigger group of patriots.

So yes, absolutely. We don't need a bigger angry mob. I think that's the last thing they need the last thing we need.

Heath says when we learn new tax structure question mark by the end of the year, we're shooting for that. I think holders will be very happy. I think the tax structure will be great especially while we wait for us holders who aren't trading the coin who aren't constantly selling the coins to be rewarded by those who are trading and selling.

Was there an update on the war on the white paper war rooms on my mind if you can't tell the update on the white paper is we're waiting for BNB to see if they'd like us to revise the old version or to rewrite it completely. We have a few volunteers who've stepped up to help rewrite it should we need a whole rewrite. Super exciting.

We're also shooting on that shooting to start working on that before the end of the year. Turok said Transac off ramp issue is not FJB specific but rather USD specific question mark. Correct.

Yes. We finally it was nice to finally get that answered. So it's BNB to USD in the US will be live by quarter one of 2023.

Is the FJB merch account under a person or LLC slash war room control? It's under a person and LLC. The LLC is actually twins.

TWINDS. That's our FJB LLC. Any plans for the BNB takeover one year anniversary announcement?

We will definitely try to get them on. I think that will be really exciting. I know that's a super busy time for Christmas and family and all that but we will do our best.

JL says any plans to sell gift cards at non political events like outside sporting events, concerts, etc? Yes, absolutely. I know most events like that we go to are pretty conservative.

We're also planning to have merch at all these events because I know generally when I see a booth without tangible stuff that I don't really ever go up to it. I just think of it as kind of boring and I don't want to go up to them and ask what it is because I'll just get stuck there. So I think that'll also help bring people to the booth and that way if they're not into crypto or they don't want a gift card they still buy a t-shirt or hat sticker what have you which also helps us.

Dogbone says buying contest. Yes, we already have that drafted. That'll most likely be after the marketing wallet contest after the marketing buying I guess not contest offer.

Anita says any plans to launch app before 2025? Yes, I think so. It will not take decades to get this right.

I still want to know who Anita is though. Oh I think actually I think I got that answered now that I think about it. Shadow says when CNN advertising?

I'm waiting. Anybody that can get us on CNN I'll pay you. Will they add better oversight after these events?

I'm assuming after the missing funds. Absolutely. It's been day and night.

Any update on LP lock? We will have that squared away by the end of the year. That's the plan.

When token swap to new chain and what about FJB blockchain? We actually started discussing that or even an FJB stablecoin. I think that's a great idea.

I do think that's kind of getting ahead of ourselves. So right now we're just trying to focus on getting the app 100% in order getting those gift cards started so we can do some grassroots marketing and then go from there. When more coins to purchase on app?

Gen X asked and he meant like dodge and so forth. We will have so again that's after we take care of the gas issue on the app and add the gift cards. After that we'll be working some bugs and then we'll start adding more coins.

Just kind of an order priority especially with the lack of funds right now. But I think that'll be very exciting. There's definitely a lot we can do with the app still.

Just got to get the basics down still. Somebody says FJB gold and silver coins. I think that'll be exciting.

Somebody already designed some that look really really cool. Is there a way to do tax-free transactions for verified business? Definitely DM me.

We can I'm sure work anything out. Let's see I think I think that was all the questions and then I just have a few updates. Yeah I think I think that was it.

Okay so as far as my updates we already went through the Transact. They'll be sending us a proposal that requires volume. If we don't hit that monthly volume cost will be a factor.

Then we had an update about our website. We actually have a new secure email list so now if you go to the website scroll all the way at the bottom and subscribe with your email you will receive a welcome email. Brand new welcome email and you'll get added to the FJB list with the major updates.

This is awesome for those folks especially who don't have time to be in the chats or don't like coming into the chats and just come in for you know the most important updates. So those are the kind of updates that we'll be sending out. You know new white paper the events and you know merch when that came live.

New website maybe some if we get featured or new sponsors. I think that'll be really cool. The new website will go live also I think this week.

Dog Bone has done an amazing amazing job. It looks so nice and new and fresh so I think you all will enjoy it. Thank you to all of our volunteers.

We still have people stepping up with more and more. Everybody's so talented and so helpful so I really appreciate it. If there's any way you'd like to help please DM me.

We'd love to have your help. It's been a community effort and I can't say thank you enough. Boris call we had him planned for this week but Boris is a very busy gentleman and attorney so we had to reschedule.

We are rescheduled for early next week. We hope that does not need to be rescheduled but I will keep you updated. I promise we have been trying to get him in here for a while now.

This is just you know first it was midterms and then he's just been again he's a very busy attorney with huge cases so we will have him here as soon as we can. This is not because he's too busy for us. He just wants to make sure that he is completely what's the word I'm thinking just completely present.

There we go. Wow words are hard. So yes we will we are planning right now on early next week but if we get rescheduled I will let you know.

So I'm excited for him to get on let you know himself that he and Bannon are still here that they are just working on everything still and just give you any update that he can so you can see how pumped he still is. I think that is literally all my updates so sorry again about the recording. Sucks because I made a note to start it and I did start it but I'm not sure what happened so I do apologize for that.

We'll try maybe we'll do a poll whether we do it like podcast style from now on so we make sure it saves and is available at one place for everyone or if we can integrate the discord and the telegram so that we can just have each live on both at the same time but we'll figure something out before the next call. I think that's everything. Thank you all very very much.

Again thank you for your patience and thank you for understanding just this is the cost of having high profile folks and it's not them not caring it's more that this is a very long-term project for them. They realize it's a bear market. They realize we need to have everything in order even more than last time.

We don't want to advertise something that is not ready or have something you know like like last time what happened have something like that happen that like we did with wire so thank you for understanding that and we'll talk Friday. Have a great night.
