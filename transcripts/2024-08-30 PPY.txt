(0:00 - 0:15)
I think I was going to be able to make it on time today. I was picking up my dog from the vet and there was a motorcycle accident on the way back. So, on the side of the mountain and everybody wanted to rubberneck.

(0:16 - 0:50)
But I made it in just in time. Okay, I hope everybody had a great week. Okay, so unfortunately our ad for the Thursday and then Friday rally today didn't fit into the company slots.

(0:50 - 1:15)
They got sold out with businesses that have been waiting for a while that decided they wanted these slots. So, we're waiting on them for the next schedule. I'm assuming they probably get that from the Trump campaign.

(1:15 - 1:26)
Probably the same time it gets updated on Trump's website. I'm not sure that they get it that much sooner than that. But they said they will update me as soon as they receive that schedule.

(1:29 - 1:41)
In better news. Okay, in better news. So, that was the negative of the week.

(1:42 - 1:59)
Obvious in PPY world. In better news, we did get two slots confirmed for September. Those will be at Candace Owens events.

(2:00 - 2:22)
Very excited for those. I will update you as we move to the final step of that. Our first payment to the direct on-ramper has been made.

(2:22 - 2:37)
Which means now we're in the third phase of that. There's two more phases we have to go through. We should be very, very, very well.

(2:38 - 2:52)
Still within September with getting that listing complete. Of course, as always, this is dependent on several factors. So if anything changes, I will keep you updated.

(2:54 - 3:07)
But from the update they sent me earlier this morning. We should be still very, very, very well within the September timeline. For the direct listing to be live.

(3:08 - 3:17)
What that means, I know some people have asked because they're a little confused. That just means when you go buy PPY in the app. You don't have to go buy Matic first and then swap it.

(3:17 - 3:32)
You get to go and use your card banking info to purchase PPY directly. Instead of having to buy Matic and then swap. Which is awesome.

(3:33 - 3:52)
May not be a huge deal to you all here. That is more seasoned crypto community or users. But to more the average person that isn't so versed with crypto.

(3:52 - 4:03)
This is a lot easier. It's one less step and a lot less confusing. So yeah, that is great.

(4:03 - 4:09)
Dog treats did come in. They should be listed tonight. So that's great.

(4:09 - 4:18)
Devs are still working. Good and bad news there. We still are.

(4:21 - 4:29)
We still have not found a way to get your funds out. If you have sent funds to the wrong address. Now this isn't, you know.

(4:29 - 4:38)
Exactly. Are like it isn't. I don't know how to say this.

(4:38 - 4:47)
I guess correctly. You know, it is the user error of users sending. Matic or, you know, to the wrong address.

(4:47 - 5:05)
However, we do still want to work on solving that. We are considering a different dad to take one last look at it before we give that up. Just because we do want to help you all get your funds that get stuck.

(5:06 - 5:18)
If you do send them to the wrong address. But you all could help us by just double checking before sending the funds that you're sending the correct funds to the correct address. And just to be safe.

(5:18 - 5:24)
I'd always just test. I wouldn't go sending hundreds of dollars all at once to an address. You've never sent to before.

(5:25 - 5:36)
It's nice to, you know, lose a few bucks or a few pennies testing. Then to lose a few hundred dollars several several hundred dollars. I will keep you updated on that.

(5:36 - 5:53)
The good news is with the other dev stuff. Everything's everything is going smoothly. I will have you all test some new stuff as soon as we're done testing it.

(5:53 - 6:04)
I did get a question in DMs. I think it was a few days ago. And no, I'm not.

(6:04 - 6:18)
Please know that I'm not ignoring you and you all send questions like this. It's just so that nobody feels like they're getting inside information. But this community member asked.

(6:19 - 6:28)
They noticed the scheduled contract. They said the schedule contract is interesting. Seems like it auto swaps stable to P.P.Y. for enrolled users.

(6:29 - 6:38)
But I'm missing. I'm missing the Y. Can you share Friday word chat? Yes. So this is part of the Patriot perks.

(6:38 - 6:52)
We'll be adding a feature that if you all schedule. Auto buys. Then we will we'll have some sort of contest and discounts going on for users that use that option.

(6:53 - 7:10)
So it's just something fun. A little fun to add to the Patriot perks and reward users who kind of want to set up more frequent automatic buys. So an example of that is say you set up every Friday.

(7:11 - 7:27)
I want to buy a hundred bucks of P.P.Y. You get to set that up in your app. And it auto doesn't pull you super cool feature. And again, we'll run contests, discounts, stuff like that for users who do decide to use that feature.

(7:31 - 7:47)
I think. That is everything I have. Seems like a few of you have reached out to our chat function.

(7:47 - 7:59)
Reply to the few of you immediately, but no replies there. So that's one of you here. Please reply so we can get you taken care of.

(8:05 - 8:14)
The confirm slots are on what day? I will update you once that's closer. Is the canvas thing live or online or both? It is live. I have no doubt.

(8:14 - 8:19)
I don't know if they live stream it. I'll check for you. But I have no doubt that they post recordings after.

(8:21 - 8:40)
Are we still working with the marketing agency? Yes. Could direct listing be live before Candace Owens event? Let me check the data. I think so.

(9:03 - 9:24)
Yes. The direct on ramp should be live before both of the Candace Owens events. Oh, yeah.

(9:24 - 9:53)
As far as the Trump rally event, I imagine the advertisement firm will contact us once they get an update from the campaign. Judging from the campaign's website, it doesn't look like they've updated any more events. I have no doubt that they will very shortly.

(9:53 - 10:45)
I think that's all I got. Everything else, the answers have not changed on. I will let you guys know as soon as I get updates.

(10:55 - 11:19)
You asked for the wallet addresses to test a week ago. Yes, we are calculating what we need to compensate you for the past testing because the new testing involves some of that. As soon as that's done, it should be done by the end of the weekend.

(11:20 - 11:36)
Then you will get instructions in the DMs. Don't forget to DM me if you did help us test. If you tested with P.P.Y. back at the end of May, I believe we started around May 30th for a few weeks there.

(11:37 - 12:26)
If you did test and basically it's if you paid P.P.Y. tax in the app for testing purposes, reach out to me so we can calculate your reimbursement. The way we want to reimburse you is we'll test some new functions using that. Is there going to be a buy limit with a direct on-ramp or like there is with chains now? Yes, and that's going to depend on each one of you on your details.

(12:27 - 12:49)
We'll get a little bit more details on that before the final phase, but yeah, that'll depend. With the Mavic 2 polygon change, will that prevent us from swapping for a time? No, not at all. That's automatic.

(12:50 - 13:01)
As far as polygon goes, they're automatically changing those. There's nothing we need to do on our end except change the front end for you guys. So just the way it looks basically.

(13:01 - 13:26)
So right now it looks like it says Mavic. We just have to change the front end to say polygon. How is the classifier? Are you joking with me? You're joking, right? How is the classified section going? The classified section has been completed for weeks, including the escrow.

(13:29 - 13:59)
Hopefully you're joking with me though. When will I get the super mega dash on right now? Ultra mega before I want to do some more testing, I guess, may even get you there. Education video is still being worked on.

(14:01 - 14:06)
Okay. Okay, it says education. Well, we know the classifieds are completed.

(14:07 - 14:23)
You guys just need to post items there. No, classifieds don't get scheduled. You guys can go in and post whatever items you have for sale.

(14:24 - 14:43)
We just need to approve them, which is pretty quick. I don't think there's any pending ones. And if you are messaging me for the testing that you did in May, make sure you send me your wallet address, please.

(14:45 - 15:14)
If you're trying to stay anonymous, you can always use the chat function or e-mail it, too. Should put the coins back up. So I can't do that.

(15:14 - 15:35)
The user needs to. And if the member who put the coins back up wants to, please DM me. I can send you the text that you actually have, because I did save that for you in case you haven't saved it, so that you can easily repost this.

(15:53 - 16:05)
That's all the updates we have. Hopefully you all don't find too many bugs. And hopefully not too many issues with switching to Polygon again.

(16:06 - 16:18)
There's really nothing for us to do on our end. Everything is happening automatically, including the LP. Sorry, I have to mute someone.

(16:19 - 16:30)
Including the LP, including everything in the app. So, yeah. You all don't need to worry about that.

(16:30 - 16:45)
At least, I should say, that's what they are saying. As you all know, sometimes that changes. If it does, we'll roll with it and do what we need to to make sure that we do everything we need to on our end.

(16:45 - 18:12)
If there's anything we need to do differently. Do you know a specific date? Yeah, it is a specific date they are giving us. Let's see.

(18:14 - 18:36)
So, our LP will upgrade from Mavic to Polygon on September 4th. Yeah, I think everything else is also September 4th. That should be good to go.

(18:39 - 18:53)
You guys shouldn't need to do anything on your end. Obviously, don't freak out around that day. If you guys have seen what happens with the TrustWallet updates and stuff like that.

(18:53 - 19:03)
Sometimes your balances can be weird. Stuff we've ran into before. Don't freak out if that happens.

(19:03 - 19:13)
Don't go deleting your apps. Don't go share it. Because generally what happens, you guys delete an app because it's acting weird.

(19:13 - 19:21)
Then you go ask for help somewhere and then you get scammed. Or there's been users that go delete the app. And then they try to go redownload the app.

(19:21 - 19:29)
And they download the incorrect app. Like a scam phishing app. And then enter their info there and get scammed.

(19:30 - 19:42)
So just be very careful of that. Around September 4th especially. If you are seeing anything weird or wonky as far as your Polygon wallets go.

(19:42 - 19:55)
Please make sure you reach out before you go on deleting stuff. And reinstalling things and entering your information everywhere. Save us all.

(19:57 - 20:13)
If you would hold off on that. And there's always somebody around. So don't be afraid to ask for help instead of going to delete stuff.

(20:13 - 20:31)
Like I said, because usually that's gotten people in trouble. I'd just rather you all not mess with it. Especially since that's what they're instructing us to do.

(20:32 - 21:01)
Is nothing. Will Brandon get out of prison early? Who knows. Have you ever met or talked to Corey Tavlin before? I have not.

(21:07 - 21:24)
And can you tell us what day Candace is having her event? Is event day the Candace Owens Show? No, it's an event. It is an event. It's not her show.

(21:24 - 22:17)
But I do love her show. I just haven't had time to watch it super recently. Yes, two events.

(22:17 - 22:26)
Does the event have a date? Yes, the events have a date. I'll let you know as soon as it's closer. I promise.

(22:40 - 22:48)
It is... Let me double check again. I will say it is the second part of September. Second half of September.

(22:48 - 23:03)
And again, our direct on-off ramp should be complete by then. Again, as you all know, as you've learned, especially with the on and off ramp, that is depending on several factors. And I will keep you updated.

(23:04 - 23:28)
But so far, we are very well into that time frame. Of course, we will have you all test it. And as I've shared before, the on-ramp company is going to work on learning our users, like our specific demographics details.

(23:30 - 24:07)
So I'm not sure, but I'm just judging from what we had go on a little bit, like what we had go on with Transat, that there may and may not be a little bit of a learning curve for them to learn a little bit more about our demographic. Because if you guys remember with Transat, we had accounts getting disabled all the time. The majority of them, when I spoke to their team, was that our demographic was a little bit older than their average user.

(24:08 - 24:35)
And that just flags the system because how many 55 plus are into crypto? Generally, from their user base and from what they've told me, it's not very many. So on their end, they think it's some kid who stole your grandma's or your parents' cards and is using it. And so they would disable your account because it was a high risk account.

(24:36 - 24:57)
So again, we may or may not have that issue with the new OnRamper. But again, they are willing to learn our user base and learn our specific demographic to better handle that. So again, I'm just anticipating from everything they've told me.

(24:57 - 25:11)
Again, that may or may not happen. But if testing does take longer, then that won't be ready. By the time Canvas has her two events that were planned to advertise at.

(25:13 - 25:27)
So yeah, keep that in mind. And of course, if you all are still testing it and it's not great, we just won't have it in the live app. So we'll just have a different link that you all will be testing on.

(25:28 - 26:08)
So hope that makes sense. That way you all can still test while we advertise and while new users are still using the current setup instead of the direct OnRamper. Are the influencers you mentioned still scheduled to recommence at the beginning? Yeah, influencers should be firing back up at the beginning of this month.

(26:10 - 26:28)
Is direct OnRamper American-based? No. Almost none of those are American-based. Absolutely not, which I would say is a good thing for us considering everything we stand for.

(27:01 - 27:57)
Anything else? Is that the first week of September? I'm assuming you're talking about influencers. Yes. Will there be foreign transaction fees? There wasn't with the bank accounts I tested.

(27:59 - 28:29)
I can double check for you if your bank account will be, if that's a case-by-case basis, depending on bank account or just altogether. I can also look through my notes to get that for you. Apart from Candace Owens, are we looking at any other events for September? Yes.

(28:29 - 29:24)
Yes, absolutely. I think September will be a crazy month, as you all see. I just pray that we get more details on other events for September.

(29:24 - 30:04)
We're definitely waiting on some more rally info because we definitely think those will be great. Like I said, influencers will still be going to Candace events, and we have some mailing lists and podcasts. Everything else now, like the app, as long as the current functions are functioning correctly, we don't need any other functions to be live.

(30:09 - 30:20)
Once marketing is beginning, we're getting new users. We'll likely have you all test new functions on another version of the app. We'll give you a different link, and you can test it there.

(30:20 - 30:47)
That way, during the time that we fix those bugs, we can continue marketing just because the app, as it is right now, has everything we need just to get by and run the basic functions. We don't want to mess with you all testing and finding bugs while new users are trying to just use the app while we're spending that marketing money. That would defeat the purpose there.

(30:49 - 31:15)
That's how we'll have you test from now on, minus the functions that we've already added that we haven't asked you guys to test yet. Hopefully that's not confusing. When I do ask you to test this coming week with the functions we've already added to the app in the past few weeks, you'll still test it in the live app because those functions are already live in the app.

(31:16 - 31:52)
A lot of them you just can't see. If that makes sense. How is QuickSwap coming along? Good. 

I've not tested it yet. It's not complete yet. Once we test it, everything's good there, then we'll have you all test it.

(31:52 - 32:26)
In that example, that will be on a new app link instead of the live app. That way, in case you all do find some bugs, devs are working on them while we can continue for any of that to be complete, especially if it's messing with other functions. More questions.

(32:31 - 32:43)
I'll be doing some testing with you all this weekend, too. Ed's favorite. 7-day rundown.

(32:44 - 33:13)
Let's see. Still send me your wallets if you all have done any testing in the app from May 30th for those few weeks if it's PPY-related. The reason I say that, if you tested with anything other than PPY, there's no tax there, right? The whole purpose is if you tested with PPY because you did pay an 8% tax every time you swapped, every time you bought, every time you sold, we need to calculate that so we can reimburse you, but we also want to reimburse you in a way that will test some other functions.

(33:13 - 33:21)
You'll be helping us in several ways. Please go ahead. Again, if you want to stay anonymous, feel free to use the chat function.

(33:22 - 33:51)
The chat function makes up a username for you and sends that, or you can also email us. Support at patriotpay.org. Feel free to do that if you want your wallet to stay anonymous so you can still get your reimbursement so you can still test out the new functions. Let's see.

(33:52 - 34:06)
Marketing will have the, hopefully, some rally dates come up. Let's see. What else? Devs will continue their work.

(34:08 - 34:27)
We should start testing some new features as far as the team goes, which should be complete this week. That's it. Dog treats will be listed, like I said.

(34:30 - 34:50)
Now that we're getting closer to the elections again with the social media, or with the social media influencers getting on, they should be posting. We'll, of course, share that on our socials. And then emails.

(34:50 - 35:00)
That's all I got on my list for the week. Should be good. Tucker will be here in a few days.

(35:00 - 35:09)
That should be fun. Just joined. We'll listen to a recording to catch up.

(35:11 - 35:23)
Are you able to share the makeup of the team and their roles, titles? I've already shared. Not really. Nope.

(35:24 - 36:45)
Which is our devs, our advisor, and then a few of the companies we work with. Pretty small. How many influencers are planned? We had a pause on that, obviously, with a few of the issues we were running into.

(36:48 - 37:12)
So we'll restart again and then fire up as that volume picks up. But I will keep you guys updated on those and, of course, share the posts in here in case you're not following the influencers. Do you expect PQI to have a full marketing launch prior to the election? Yes.

(37:16 - 37:23)
Although I think full... I guess let's do a definition of full, too. And we'll go for lunch. I will, too.

(37:23 - 37:35)
I'm starving, actually. I have two archer bars. Or sticks, whatever.

(37:53 - 38:03)
Heavenly Father, as we come to the end of our time together, we thank you for what has been accomplished today. Thank you for guiding and protecting this project and all those involved. In Jesus' mighty name, amen.

(38:04 - 38:09)
That's it. Thank you. Appreciate it.

(38:09 - 38:19)
Oh, and the lightning mixer. Thank you. I appreciate that.

(38:19 - 38:31)
Appreciate that with the week I've had. Okay. That is everything I have.

(38:31 - 38:57)
Please remember to stay safe, again, with... Let's see. When is... I guess we should... Okay, so we'll talk again before then. Just be careful, again, with the polygon switch in case there's any scammers lurking at that time to take advantage of that.

(38:58 - 39:12)
Sending out links. Again, don't share your info anywhere. If you have, you know, a grandma or a mom or dad or something that has a crypto wallet, make sure they are aware to do nothing.

(39:12 - 39:53)
And again, if your stuff is wonky or something is off, don't go deleting your app and then, you know, trying to reinstall a phishing app or on a phishing website or... What were those? Gosh, what was it with QuickSwap? They were adding... I want to say it was an app and a site with, like, an extension. So just be very careful of that. Always ask in the chats just in case you don't want you to delete the app and then go looking for some phishing app or what happens to be a phishing app and entering your information there.

(39:54 - 40:09)
Don't freak out in case there is anything. They're saying it should be pretty smooth, but again, you've seen how that goes even with TrustWallet updates and bigger... Even, you know, ChangeNow and Transact. So just be very, very careful there, please.

(40:09 - 40:27)
Keep your funds safe. As always, if you're going into other chats and other coins, I would just make a whole new wallet that you don't have a lot in to mess around with instead of your main wallet. Let me know if you have anything else.

(40:27 - 41:01)
In the meantime, feel free to DM, text, call, email, support chat. And then, again, make sure you do send me your wallet address if you did test between May 30th and on those few weeks so we can get you reimbursed and also test in the process a few of the functions. I will keep you guys updated with everything that's happening before Tuesday.

(41:02 - 41:19)
I'll post that in the announcements. I hope you all have a great night. I am going to go check on my dog since we just got back from his surgery before I come back on to upload this and post some notes.

(41:21 - 41:28)
So give me just a bit of time and I'll get that posted. Thank you all so much.
