[Speaker 1]
Record through telegram. We'll see how that goes Okay, awesome. Oh, you're fine heath I was wondering what happened because the window just closed but I thought it's because I came online as the fjb channel instead of myself, but I think heath accidentally kicked us off Um already well happy tuesday night.

We're getting closer to thanksgiving Thank you all for joining me. I appreciate it. I appreciate you taking the time out of your evening um for some updates So let's get right in it A little upset my uh, zevia That I usually have for caffeine like midday I forgot to put in the fridge so i'm drinking an iced tea instead um so I got a lot of the same questions, so I kind of um, just Summarize them together so I won't be reading Um the exact questions because I think I mean everybody at this point, uh is asking about the same stuff So i'll just review it I'll go through all the updates and then let me know if there's anything that I haven't answered But I think we should be able to uh to cover everything That I got in the dms as far as the questions go through the updates um Okay, let me know if anything happens with the sound i'll put it on the split screen so I can see Um, all right, so a lot of people um Asking about where velo's at as far as the app updates Um, because it's been a while since he put I think it may have been when finn was here Uh was the last list that we got from velo um, so I know he had hurt his shoulder and then shortly after is when I came in and figured out that he was uh Overdue we were overdue on paying him so Um, we are back to making payments. That's been a few weeks now Uh, we scheduled something more concrete this week and we are back to paying him. He has been very gracious to continue working as Long as we're making the payments to him and he's been very gracious in Volunteering his time to help us out a little bit as far as meetings and a lot of planning um with the planning i'm mainly talking about the Process behind the smart wallet deploying that and the fjb gift card um, I am also learning a lot because it just seems so easy like oh add a Fjb gift card button on the app. We should be good, right?

Um, but i'm learning it's a lot more complicated than that. So he has been so gracious to volunteer uh his time as far as Maneuvering us and coaching us through that um I know somebody also asked can he get on voice? Uh, i'm sure he would be more than willing We've just been using the any volunteer time that he's willing to give us Towards that gift card and getting that smart wallet out just because I figured you guys would probably prefer that too um But let me know we're really really really trying to get that out asap Just to start getting funds in so we can continue Moving on and moving along um, let's see as far as so somebody asked about the details of what Is the smart wallet that we're trying to add on? Um, so why we're really pushing for velo to get the smart wallet Working on the app is because this solves the gas issue and I know personally um, that was the Biggest complaint I saw in my dms in the chats People get on they're getting transaction failed and they have no idea. They're supposed to have ethereum in their wallet So having the smart wallet on the app will do all of that on the back end so that You don't have to worry about the gas and it does it for you on the back end Um, so you don't have to worry about that.

So that's a huge problem. That would be solved uh, especially once we start getting boomers on here because think about it if I mean We're pretty even those new to crypto that you know fjb maybe was their first crypto We're pretty crypto savvy compared to Boomers and even a lot of us were like, oh, I didn't know I was supposed to have ethereum So that's why that's such a huge issue Now he already has the smart wallet code. That's not the issue.

That's he's been working on that. I'm not sure for how long Um, but that has a lot to do with the past due balance that we have with him the issue is um We need well, he first suggested that we get an audit Um to make sure that the smart wallet doesn't break because if it does and obviously with the political nature of our app um, you know if we have somebody come in and Purposely try to break it um We need ethereum evan is asking in the main chat um, so So why? Velo suggested an audit is because that way with the nature of our project somebody comes in tries to break it on purpose People would lose users would lose their funds flat out lose their funds. Uh, so that's why he is so worried about that We obviously cannot afford a twenty thousand dollar audit right now.

So what we have is Uh some volunteers from some of our other contractors huge huge companies Um, very very brilliant guys willing to volunteer their time to go through the code read through it and see if they see anything um that You know anything that comes to their attention that they think uh needs to be changed After we do that we're going to have a few people from the communities Open up a few new wallets with not much funds in them and we're going to have them try to break the app That way we see if there's anything a user can do to break it and then after that Velo will go ahead and approve us once he thinks that the smart wallet is safe to Put on the app So but it is done. Yes, the smart wallet is awesome And it really would make everything so much easier would get rid of the whole gas issue on the app, which is huge So that's why we keep going back to that Another thing is the gift cards the gift cards.

I thought it would be something so easy Um, we have been working on that process It's a very very long one and we should be have we should be getting a quote On what it would cost to add fjb gift cards to the app by the end of this week And I will update you on that. Uh, we are hoping that it's something that's going to be doable uh for us to do asap And we will do everything we can to get that because getting that would be a game changer, especially with this time of year And that would definitely help us one get the word out as far as marketing Uh, but to really help us as far as funding goes so we can get going and get back on track All right The next one Somebody asked about the lp lock.

Is it locked? No, the lp is not locked yet What we did was pull the lp from deep lock, which is the third party Which we were all Praying that we could pull that because the website has gone offline a few times Also because their twitter got restricted Their telegram got shut down a few people Made new telegram pages talking about it saying they lost funds. So we were Really stressing about that, but thankfully we were able to pull the lp out We did transfer it to a brand new dev wallet with new keys that are safe and secure um so that that's that we haven't relocked it because Uh, the team really wants to make sure that the third party just with everything going on With everything going on with deep lock and so many other crypto Excuse me So many other crypto Third parties going belly up.

This is a huge concern to us. We don't want to lock the lp With a third party where we're not going to feel Like it's safe or secure. So that's why we moved it to a brand new wallet So now we have a new dev wallet a new marketing wallet a new charity wallet And we also went ahead And locked bmb's wallets both bannon and boris's wallets to make sure that those keys are secure But also hoping that it would show something to the community if boris and bannon sold their keys that right there would eat up um the lp So that that counts for anything.

We did also go ahead and lock their wallets and we will be transferring Those coins to new secure wallets where we know Everybody who has the keys to these wallets And that's why the lp Hasn't been locked. It will be locked. The plan is to get it re-locked and we will keep you updated on that All right.

Somebody asked about Um, actually a few people asked about if we've thought about uh business loan Or some sort of funding to get back on track um We have not but that's why we're pushing so hard for the fjb gift cards The smart wallet for the easier app purchases and the merch Just because we're not We're less than 20 grand In debt, which obviously is a ton But we've had no problem before getting funds built up You know hundreds of thousands of dollars was no issue for us so we know it's very doable and Really the debt we have isn't absolutely insane. We do think Uh and believe that if we get that smart wallet With the fjb gift cards and the merch I think it'd be the perfect time of year and for us to start also kicking off grassroots marketing So, you know, we set up a booth um At what have you any rally great that trump is going to be doing continue doing these rallies. That'll be great for us, too um, and you know sell them for 25 30 pop that eats adds up easily and Kind of get back on track from there And also, like I said the smart wallet, which is a huge one Fixing that gas issue making it a lot easier.

So people aren't getting frustrated on the app while trying to purchase Okay Next one We already talked about the payment smart wallet gift cards transact updates Um, so a few questions about that and wondering about a deadline So I last I told you with transact and fireblocks keep going back and forth Transact tells us fjb needs to check with fireblocks Which is who helps? translock transact off ramp It's just another third party And fireblocks says no, you're good check with transact so now Transact and fireblocks have agreed that we need to speak to fireblocks. Uh, my last email with them was this morning Agreeing to a meeting.

I have not heard back, but I will keep you updated as soon as uh, they set up a meeting I'm, not sure if they'll be gone for the rest of the week, but I haven't heard back from them today um They emailed me this morning so they should be in the office But i'll keep you updated on that Okay um another big question understandably so Was the voice call? Um from bannon or boris a lot of people understandably are taking this personally Um, I want to make sure that You are not taking this personally um Your feelings are valid. I understand why you feel that way um, but please keep in mind just the political climate we're in right now and Kind of what came out with fjb and our missing funds Really came at some of the worst time Um some of the best also because I would much rather that happen before we have a huge marketing push in our war room Um, but in the worst way as far as how busy uh, bannon and boris are um, that's unfortunately the downside of having You know such high profile folks on the projects.

I do want you to know it's not a lack of me trying They are really just that that that busy Um, so getting something scheduled. Um, they are more than willing. That's not the issue They are more than happy to they always have been um, just getting something scheduled Has been very very difficult But please do not take it personal.

Just keep in mind everything that's going on in the country It is not that they don't care about the project or don't care about you It's just that in the midst of everything else. They're looking on they figure at at they figure okay, this can be Pushed to the back this can wait You know this this can wait a day this can wait a week this can wait a month versus everything else that is So so time sensitive and so critical right now, so please do understand that Again, your feelings are valid. I totally understand why you feel that way, but please just keep in mind just how How crazy everything going on?

In the country is especially right here in maricopa Um, so I know they are working on that but even their assistants are um beyond slammed So just please keep that in mind, um, I will get them on as soon as possible weekends are usually off Uh days for them and obviously the holidays that doesn't help either I do appreciate your patience and i'm sure they do too Um, another question was about the outstanding outstanding gosh, I can't speak today Um bills and invoices somebody asked are they all paid? No, they are not paid.

Um, we do have some funds I'm sure you can check or you have checked in our marketing wallet And the charity wallet we are legally not Touching right now, but the marketing wallet, um, we do have we just don't want to clear that out in one go um One we don't want to obviously drive the price down and kill that But two we just need to have the funds there In case we get some crazy emergency and we also have to pay Monthly expenses that can't wait like the uh web hosting and you know emails and that kind of stuff um, but we are Making payments to velo. We're scheduled for payments now and That way we can get the smart wallet and hopefully the fjb gift cards as soon as possible Okay Oh, oh another one.

Um, I think zenny asked about our website. Um claiming Claiming some kind of the I think he's you're talking about the purchases zenny if I'm not mistaken

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, the automatic clearinghouse Yes, um, so I said no way is there going to be wire transfers but the website says at least ach

[Speaker 1]
Yes, so I did ask on that, um, that is Back from when wire when we were doing everything with wire that is not current and we will make sure to update that I will check with uh fireblocks In our meeting once they get back to me Um on that and see if that is an option for us But the website claim that is old from wire that was never updated Thanks, of course anytime Uh, the last question I got was about partnerships how many other partnerships is Are the team currently considering?

Um off the top of my head. We have one two three Three I can think of off the top of my head. Um the crypto space um and The political space.

Oh my gosh. It's almost impossible to get a hold of people and um, Yeah, so i'm just waiting to uh For people to get back to me or you know back and forth Um, but we will update you as soon as anything is finalized. Um, super exciting I know it's super frustrating because We've been very busy on the back end.

Um, but I really can't wait to For it to show results and all that hard work to pay off and all you're waiting to pay off Okay, let me see if you have any questions Z money says i'll pitch in to help cover gift card stuff if needed You could easily raise 20k in the community in a day if fandom came on voice and pumped us up Absolutely, um, I am trying very hard to schedule that and as far as the gift cards, um, Yeah, I hope to get an estimate by the end of this week the guys. Um, we're working on With for that are very reliable So I have no doubt that it will be by the end of the week that we get an estimate on that Go trucker says would you explain baby fjb? I have no clue what it's about Um, it's just another coin that we've partnered with they Are going to be our charity reflections arm um So you can by having their coin you earn fjb reflections.

It helps us because they buy fjb And pay eight percent tax on it they will also be Sharing the charity wallet and transferring it to an fjb charity wallet Where they have agreed to let our partners announce the charity Um in our name in partnership with baby fjb Um, I know a lot of people were unhappy about that. That's understandable But we have talked about charities before and reflections and a lot of people were split There's people saying this, you know charities is why they got onto the coin When are we doing the next donation and there are people that are saying they want to make charity on their own um, so this is you know, this was a decision made to Give the option for the people that do want us to donate to charity. We will still be Through the partnership.

We will still be making those donations as Coming from fjb You know like any relationship. It's a give and take with the business and that's something they baby fjb has agreed to and For those that are wanting to do charity on their own or don't want to donate you don't have to Uh, they also are a they Well, I know they've not been Uh done social media for a while, but they plan on getting back on social media and they also do memes Which is what we used to do fjb here, which does help spread the word as far as You know the internet goes Is baby fjb in any way affiliated with grant or non now no No to my knowledge neither grant or non Um or are affiliated with baby fjb and all the the contract for Baby fjb has brand new keys I think the only thing left is the discord and I haven't checked on that in the last few days So i'm not sure if the baby fjb has been transferred from non Will the gift card purchase fjb at the current price when the gift card is bought or the price when the gift card is loaded Into the app. Ooh, so we've spent the last two days working on this um And we will let you know once that is finalized.

It's it's crazy. Um, I love Learning how stuff works. So it really is been truly fascinating and eye-opening because to me I thought it was like oh you add in you know a button and Just like you would purchase anything else on the app But it's much more complicated than that there's um Somewhat of an idea I can I mean I can go through it if you would like This is kind of the most updated idea I have not I have I I do not when I say that, uh, i'm not taking credit for this.

This is uh People much much smarter than me I just give our like front end input, you know Like i'm I know as much as a boomer does so so I give out like the the dumb question And then they you know, then we go from there. Um, but let me go in here so I can read a little bit of What we've reached so far and again, um, do not quote me in this As you know, this is just letting you in on what's going in on the back end. We this might not be This might not this is not set in stone by any means so, please don't hold me to this again This is just sharing with you.

Uh what's going on on the back end right now? So, uh in person the buyer will swipe a card we're talking this is we're talking like a you know You go to a rally. There's a fjb booth, right?

So in person the buyer swipes a card Um It a trade then happens via the app with a delivery wallet Write down the amount on the card and make note on a piece of paper. This is a fjb employee Unless we can code a specific field For a specific login for the employee on the app. So then the field would go straight to the database Of course that's preferable we'd like to make it as Automatic as possible Then the gift card will have a redemption code on it.

The redemption code redeems to the app wallet It's redeemed from and the database stores redemption code and number of fjb coins. It's supposed to disperse The wallet address isn't needed in the database since the user hasn't created a wallet yet as long as the redemption code Is you know non-sequential so anything like one two, three four We shouldn't have an issue with this the app then generates the code and shows it to me so I can write it down That way it's recorded directly into the database Then we can use a label printer to print the codes and stick them on the physical cards And then we can collect an email with it in case there's any issues And then we're hoping we can format a success Screen in plain text where I can copy and paste it into the label software to print So you'd have transaction number amount of fjb Redemption code and then an easy copy and paste print label stick on To put on pre-printed gift cards And then we can have the success screen send an e-gift card directly from the fjb domain Which will just say something like hey buyer. Do you want a physical card or do you want us to email it to you?

uh to your person that you're gifting it to um, so that Is what we've been working on the last few days again, please don't hold me to that. That is not set in stone. We're still uh working with the devs to find the best way possible without Breaking the bank something affordable and being on such a time crunch Might not be the absolute best way, but hopefully something to get us started for the holiday season and rallies Okay When will baby fjb be available in the app?

We have not started that and um That's not i'm not sure if baby fjb has decided on that yet You will have to uh speak to them All right, i'm concerned about baby fjb And any rugging when we launch will they lock lp for an extended period for our appearance? It might make us look bad if they did rug. No, we will make sure uh fjb will make sure that our legal agreement with Baby fjb with them getting on the app covers us and them so that does not happen Um We are trying as you see even with the third party and locking the lp.

We are being very very cautious and Extra careful about our funds and the security of our funds and any accounts. It has been an absolute nightmare um As far as not just our funds go but any other accounts we have with logins Um, so we are doing everything we can to not repeat that um, that's another uh Aspect of everything going on behind the scenes Uh, hold on. Sorry.

Somebody I think needs to be muted um Okay That's another aspect of what's uh been Keeping me really busy behind the scenes is getting all our contractors to sign Ndas to sign legal Papers for us to protect us. So we are being very very very cautious and very careful about that um And again, this is also, you know, even with huge third parties With locking the lp you just never know. We are in a crypto winter and We will make sure That we do everything we can to make sure that our funds are secure and to protect all of you and your funds Can name be changed from baby fjb to something more professional sounding?

uh, probably discuss that with Jl young and moku See what other ideas you have somebody says fjb jr Um R fjb. Ooh Reflections fjb or republican fjb. I know a lot of or right wing fjb Trying to think of all my r's Yeah, fjb jr is kind of cool Retarded fjb.

Somebody says oh, that's a mean Um Yeah, I think that's all the updates I have as far as volunteers um We have somebody amazing working on our website. I actually am still waiting for something to send him To allow him to make the changes he needs to make To polish up our website and make sure it's all updated. So that's been amazing Um, I do need a volunteer graphic designer of some sorts Um, my husband can help a little bit, but he's also so busy this time of year with his job.

Um, so if anybody's out there, um And again, we I mean, I don't want to It's not we can't afford to pay you something. Um We just cannot pay the prices we have been paying But that would really help out as far as merch We have a few really cool things. Uh, we are just working out the pricing so I can get that um Approved right now.

We just have the printify standard pricing on there, um I don't know if that's Something people are used to paying if that's everything everybody would be okay with but i'm just going to get that approved before sharing I've been working on that all day. We have t-shirts sweatshirts Um, let me see. Let me pick up the I can share a few but then i'm not sure I think you guys can google image search on them Find it because the store is not ready Uh wrapping paper for christmas christmas ornaments koozies water bottles stickers magnet Um, let's see.

What else we have. I figured we just start it asap. Um, like probably tonight or tomorrow We'll be sharing it with you And then we just keep adding stuff hat coasters sandals Let's see.

What else? Um, I think that's all I think I covered everything so far that we have on there Um, but yeah, I figured we can get that started and that would help us raise funds and help people uh buy Christmas gifts gosh, I don't know um And uh help us with funds in the meantime and then we can Add stuff every day, of course always open to your input So let us know if there's anything, you know specific you want us to add on there.

We'll go ahead and add that um but That's as far as that goes somebody said Sean says I could do stick figure graphic design Mm-hmm awesome Go truckers says thanks to you paradox and everyone behind the scenes holding the together for us Without you guys, we would be helpless appreciate your hard work Appreciate that. Thank you. Um There is a lot behind Going on behind the scenes, um, but we have got a ton more volunteers and everything's really been going Very smoothly, which is amazing um, like I said, just a lot of work that should have You know been done in the beginning just foundational work and a lot of paperwork to make sure that that everything funds Are safe and secure and that we're all covered legally with our contractors to our contractors have all been super amazing Very gracious. Um And so so helpful. We are grateful for that and grateful Wow, i'm having trouble speaking today Um, no more iced tea for me And it's like this.

Uh, I don't know my mom got it for me. I didn't want to break her heart I don't usually drink this. It's like a pure leaf Uh, no sugar unsweetened lemon I usually like to brew my own tea um But yeah, we really appreciate that.

We don't take it for granted. Um, that's why when this all came about Uh as far as our missing funds And the team said oh no, you know, is the community going to be so discouraged we need to end this That's why my first thought and I made sure that they knew no way this is If there's a community that can get through this it is all of you And we appreciate that and we don't take it for granted and we appreciate your patience as we Really make sure that we are super safe Legally and as far as our secure funds from this point moving forward including the lp lock Um, baby fjb offer still stands. I have enough baby fjd and tip cc To set up several more fjb Okay, I guess uh enough to jigger Okay, so if you'd like evan is gifting baby fjb it sounds like I think correct me if i'm wrong So if you'd like to join the baby fjb discord, uh, yes, evan says yes, uh ask evan for it I don't have it on hand right now, but I can get it for you guys, too um And he is wanting to gift some baby fjb to set off the reflections Jose says are bannon and boris helping with the bills? Um, no, they are not we are doing that all uh Self-funded Yeah, just um, I think a lot of people who have multiple businesses Can agree that you like each business taking care of itself um, and I think I think we're very close, so I don't think 20k is Huge let me see who's It's gonna be sorry it looks like oh i was trying to meet somebody but I think they're already Oh, there we go Muted dawn um, yeah so, um It's not a ton. I think we can do that with the smart wallet and the gift cards and the merch I think that's more than doable With the money we have come into the project that 20k Is absolutely a hundred percent doable.

That will not be a problem not to say That i'm not super angry that we are 20k in debt. There's no reason we should be um But we will we should have no problem getting this again coupled with that. It's honestly like god is on our side Even as far as our contractors they have been so amazing and so understanding And that's been really great Okay Need marketing to get gift cards and merch going won't sell itself.

Absolutely. And that's the plan That's why we're really the first Thing on our to-do list is getting that smart wallet or fixing the app gas issue Any way we can because there's no Reason to market when people are going to get on the app and get the transaction failed message because they don't have ethereum And that's just going to frustrate people and put a bad taste in their mouth Instruction video. Yes, that's on the list.

Um Of we're hiring out for that. Um, but if anybody here wants to do it we would be more than happy to Accept that can you get two excel tall hoodies? We are working on the tall ones.

Um By working I mean finding them. It's just the issue with we're going through printify now And a lot of the companies don't have tall shirts so it's it's a balance between uh getting that and getting um, The frankenstein arms no joke and uh getting something with decent quality one paradox promotion to french fry cook Huh? I don't know.

That must be an inside joke. I don't know it Okay Um, I think that's all the questions. Um, i'm pretty sure I everything I got in my inbox I answered um If I didn't get right back to you, I think I answered it on the call But as always reach out to me to paradox to any of the mods or ask in chat And we will go ahead and get you covered Um heath says voice chat friday.

Yeah, we can still do one. We are sorry. Those are my puppies.

Uh wrestling I got one puppy and Then he was lonely and the older dogs didn't want to play with him. So then I got him a friend So it's a real zoo here Um, but yes the voice chat on friday, we will try to figure out a time where everybody's available It might be different than usual. Maybe Um, the only thing I have planned is going to watch the soccer game Will we see the social media posts rolling out again, yes, absolutely.

Um, that's just another Um thing with that and why that's taking a little bit longer is making sure we have certain guidelines Set in place to protect us Moku says feel free to dm jl and myself if you have any questions that we can answer for you in regards to baby fjb Um, yes, absolutely. Please. Don't um, actually thank you for reminding me.

This is something I did want to Touch on a little bit, please If you have i'm so sorry, you can probably hear my puppies.
