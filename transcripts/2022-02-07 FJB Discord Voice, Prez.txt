Dubstep Music Don't you know pump it up. Don't you know, bump it up, you got to bump it up. You know, I was just, I was jacked up, I was juiced up, I was fired up tonight.

(0:46 - 1:02)
It was, I don't even know what it is, Monday night, Monday night, 7.05 p.m. Eastern, February 7th, I'm all fired up, I'm jacked up, so. I'm, I was like, you know what, I was on a phone call before about this. We're working some things out.

(1:02 - 2:47)
We have some great things, I'm absolutely fired up. You know, I said, I'm getting I'm getting on VOD, one of these in a while. I miss Discord, I miss hearing that song, I miss getting fired up, seeing I'm just really fired up, I'm juiced up. 

I don't know what it is about, I think I'm just so excited about this project, because I've been seeing some silliness happening, and you know what, and I'm the number one, I think I think one of the important things I've been talking about is day one energy. I think I've been reiterating that so much, and I don't even think I've been living it as much as I should. Because if it's day one energy, then I need to get on Discord voice, I need to play Pump It Up, I need to get fired up. 

I need to get fired up. So I said, day one energy, I need to start practicing what I preach. And trust me, you guys know we are working around the clock. 

We were up at 4am Eastern, Donny was up, Fscomo was up, Rendog was up, we were dominating StockTwits, and you know what StockTwits did? They censored us. We were by far number one by 9am. It was 6.15am and we were number one. 

6.15am. StockTwits, I saw us go from number one, way higher than Peloton. What did Peloton have, 20? We were at like 21. You refresh the screen, boom, we're at like 17. 

I'm like, oh yeah, how the heck did that happen? I'm in between sets of the gym, pumping out StockTwits, getting an account banned, another account, getting that account banned, another account. I said, you know what, that's gonna happen. They hate us because they ain't us. 

That's what they do. They hate us because they ain't us. So they censored FJB, they still couldn't stop us.

(2:47 - 3:31)
They posted a tweet out to a million people with FJB coin on there, but little do they know that FJB obviously means what we all know, but it also means Freedom Jobs and Business. So do they want to censor that, like Canada censoring the truckers? Do they want to do that? Fine, go ahead and do that because FJB donates 10 million coins to the Freedom Convoy, because that's what we do. We do not stop. 

Any single opportunity that we can get to move this thing forward, we do. We do not stop. We do not stop. 

We do not stop. We are fired up on our end. We are working endlessly for this app. 

Trust me on that. The new website looks fantastic. Shout out to the community for that. 

We have a fantastic web developer here. The website looks baller. It looks absolutely stunning.

(3:31 - 3:42)
If you haven't checked it out, FJBCoin.org, you know where to go. Number one trending on StockTwits, what, twice in the past couple of days? You know what? 4 a.m. tomorrow morning, I'm going to be up and at it again. I'm going to be hitting StockTwits again.

(3:43 - 5:46)
I don't know who wants to come with me, but I know Donnie's going to be there. They're probably going to shut us down again. You know what? You want to know what? Shut us down? Whatever. 

Shut us down. I don't care. We're going again. 

So StockTwits, we're hitting that again. We donated 10 million coins. 10 million coins. 

You saw it all over the socials. You saw the post. Keep shilling that. 

Let the world know that we're helping the Freedom Convoy, because that's what we're about. We're about freedom. We're about jobs, and we're about business, because that's total BS. 

That's absolute crap what's going on in Canada, and it's disgusting. It's censorship to the T. GoFundMe, I don't even want to start about GoFundMe, because it's horrible what they're doing. Absolutely horrible. 

It's pathetic. It is crazy. So, what FJB does is what we do best, and we make things right. 

We donated 10 million coins to them. We want this thing absolutely everywhere. We want everybody to know that we're stepping in to help, because that's what FJB Coin does. 

That's what this community is. We were built on that. We were built on donations. 

We were built on the community, and we will not stop giving back. You guys are awesome. You guys are incredible. 

I'm fired up. I wanted to be here because of that day one energy. That's a funny picture of her who sent that, but I wanted to be here because of that day one energy. 

I wanted to show you guys that I'm still fired up, because I've seen some people post messages saying, oh, is Grant still excited? Is he still here? We're not doing voice sessions every night. I am totally, totally, totally all in on this project still. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't. 

I think that I built enough trust in this Discord and in this community for you guys to know that I'm putting everything into this coin, and that I will not stop until this coin is a top, not even just a top 50 coin, but a top 10 coin, that in the textbooks in 50 years, when they're reading about the whole crypto wave, and they're reading about basically the new age gold rush, they're going to mention FJB. It's because of these voice calls on February 7th at 7pm. It's because of these things that we're in that realm with Bitcoin.

(5:46 - 6:25)
We're mentioned with Ethereum. We're mentioned with these coins on the Mount Rushmore of crypto. That's what we're working for. 

That's what we're working for. We're working to give back, and we're working for uncensorship, total uncensorship, because we will not stop. FJB is freedom, jobs, and business, baby, and you also know what that other meaning is, and we are not stopping. 

We are not stopping. FJB, we're going to be a top 10. I cannot wait, because we will not stop. 

Just wait until you guys see this app. It's going to be easier than buying toilet paper on Amazon. Getting coins for FJB is going to be easier than buying toilet paper on Amazon. 

I can assure you that. I love you guys. You guys are awesome.

(6:25 - 6:29)
Please keep that day one energy up. Keep it going. Keep it rolling.

(6:29 - 7:23)
Please, please, please, because we are not stopping. We are not quitting until we are mentioned in every single household. We are going to be a household name. 

When people say, I don't know anything about cryptocurrency, but I know about FJB, that's what's going to happen, because that vision that I had 108, 109 days ago, I still have that vision. I still have that vision. Keep this thing going. 

Keep this thing moving. Love you guys. Keep pushing. 

I know sometimes it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but stay patient, because this thing is going to be well worth it. What is it? Fortune favors the bold. Fortune favors the brave. 

Fortune also favors the patient, but also the people that go out and do something about it. That's what you guys are here doing. That's what you guys are here and you have been doing. 

Everybody, have a great Monday night. We aren't stopping this thing. See you guys later.
