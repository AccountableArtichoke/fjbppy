(0:01 - 0:27)
All right, happy Friday. I hope everybody is doing well. Happy December 2. I am very sorry we did not hit the testing deadline in November, but we are hitting some major accomplishments behind the scenes.

(0:28 - 0:42)
And I'm very, very, very excited about it. Everything on the technical end is going perfectly as expected so far. So that is wonderful news.

(0:43 - 0:56)
Feels good to be here. And I will let you guys know as soon as we can share that all with you. Oh, shoot.

(0:56 - 1:12)
Oh, shoot. Somebody's saying audio is very low. Is everybody having that issue? Using the same everything that I usually do.

(1:34 - 1:57)
Everybody else hear me? OK, perfect. See if you can bring your volume up, voodoo child. See if you can bring up your volume up in Discord.

(1:57 - 2:04)
But everybody else's volume seems to be fine. I'm not doing anything different. And I'm in my usual spot at my desk.

(2:04 - 2:16)
So yeah, everything is great. We had some huge developments this morning on the technical side. Feeling wonderful about that.

(2:20 - 2:34)
And that's it, really. We are waiting on some tweaks to the announcement video, our voiceovers. We went through, honestly, probably a dozen of them.

(2:34 - 2:43)
And they were all very terrible. So just getting some tweaks on that. And then you all can start testing.

(2:44 - 3:03)
But we couldn't start testing without giving you guys everything. So when you start testing, you're going to know what everything is that we've been working on. So that's why we need to have that announcement video absolutely finalized.

(3:05 - 3:22)
At this point, we're thinking we might keep it on a Tuesday, Friday schedule. So even if we end up being wrapped up Sunday, we might wait till the Tuesday. But I'll keep you guys updated on that, depending on if it's like a day difference.

(3:24 - 3:34)
But charts are looking great. Not too shabby. We think we're at a yearly high.

(3:35 - 3:44)
I'm thinking off the top of my head. I'm not looking at any charts. So I think we're at a yearly high.

(3:45 - 3:55)
So that's exciting. Yeah. Boris and Steve are excited.

(3:57 - 4:09)
Our devs are, I think, very, very relieved. Our divisor is very relieved. Yeah, it feels good.

(4:09 - 4:16)
It feels good. It's been a long ride. And I know we're not quite done yet.

(4:17 - 4:25)
But it does feel really good. And I can't wait for you all to see it. Again, I think it'll be a great, great month.

(4:27 - 4:39)
I have not received any questions. I have received you guys' SomeWire accounts. I think we've resolved all of them now.

(4:39 - 4:49)
So if you do have funds on Wire, you do still have a few days. Please let me know if you need help with that. Finally, got a good contact.

(4:49 - 4:59)
So let me know if you need help with that. Also get your funds off XT, off LBank. We cannot help you after any point now.

(5:00 - 5:18)
They can decide that our delisting is finalized and those coins they're keeping. So please get your funds off LBank and XT. If you know anybody that has FJB, definitely coworkers, family, let them know because you never know what they could have.

(5:18 - 5:35)
There's still quite a bit of coins on there. And the sheets they're giving me, most of those are pretty tiny wallets, probably leftovers from transfers and stuff. But there's still quite a bit of pretty large wallets on there.

(5:35 - 5:48)
So please get those funds off. We cannot help you after they decide that they don't want to give you your funds anymore. That we've been delisted long enough that they will not give you your coins.

(5:49 - 6:06)
So, how was the TPUSA meeting on Wednesday? Are we spending the five figures to attend the event? The meeting went amazing, better than it could possibly have gone. They have been super, super, super gracious with us. I think we can probably thank Steve for that.

(6:07 - 6:26)
And they're really bending over backwards for us. So, right now we have a dev team that started today to get the app portion wrapped up as quickly as they can. They are estimating three to four days.

(6:28 - 6:53)
We hope they can hit that deadline, but if they cannot, I'm not too stressed about it. Again, I'd rather not be at the TPUSA AmeriFest as a booth rather than have a non-working app or have people have negative experiences. And I think we all know at the end of the day, War Room is our bread and butter there.

(6:54 - 7:09)
So, I will keep you updated on that. But the meeting went better, honestly, than I could have ever imagined. And they are being so gracious with us and literally just doing everything they can.

(7:10 - 7:32)
But again, we still need to have everything working by a specific date. Otherwise, it's just a waste of all your hard-earned money to go ahead and be there if we're not just going to see any ROI on that. So, everything is done, except the how-to and the launch videos.

(7:32 - 7:48)
Um, pretty much. There'll be some steps that just need to happen live, but everything else is pretty much complete for testing. So, yeah.

(7:49 - 8:05)
It's, uh, it was a good morning, even though I had, like, a mini breakdown. It rained here last night, which it hasn't rained in so long. And, uh, my internet, uh, just, like, abruptly stopped when I was on a roll.

(8:05 - 8:12)
And so, I waited, like, an hour for it to come back. It didn't, so I finally went to bed. I wake up in the morning, and my internet was still not working.

(8:13 - 8:32)
It wasn't working until, I don't know, I want to say maybe 10 a.m. So, I had a mini, mini breakdown. And I can't just go, like, anywhere because, obviously, I need, like, pretty secure connection. So, my last resort was that I was just going to go to my parents or my sister.

(8:33 - 8:40)
But that's when it finally, my internet came back. So, crisis averted. But it was quite, quite the night.

(8:44 - 8:50)
That's weird. Russ is saying, ultra low volume. Try turning up your volume in Discord, Russ.

(8:51 - 9:02)
There should be, like, a little sliding bar. Are we going to have to wait for the app to be finished before task reveal? No. No.

(9:02 - 9:23)
We are not waiting on the app for task reveal. Let's see. There's still a volume bar, right? I think there is.

(9:23 - 9:30)
There used to be. Let's see. Hopefully, it doesn't kick me off.

(9:30 - 9:35)
I'm going to get on Discord. Oh, my. Oh.

(9:37 - 9:51)
Sorry, that's my super dog barking up there. Okay, there's another. There used to be a bar at the end, but.

(9:54 - 9:58)
Oh, oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry about that. One second.

(10:03 - 10:32)
Hey! Hey! No! Sorry about that. Okay, hopefully, everybody can hear me better. I don't know why anybody's having issues.

(10:32 - 10:48)
Let me try burning up the volume as much as I can from my end. I'll try to speak louder. Yeah, so I think that's good.

(10:49 - 11:12)
Again, we have all wire. I have proof that all wire funds have been recovered by all the users I've made aware. Oh, is anybody in here that was having issues with the white screen on their app? Could you log in and tell me if that's fixed? We did push some updates in the past, like two hours.

(11:20 - 11:33)
And let me know if you're still getting the white screen in your app for the few users that were still having that issue. We did actually, I should log into my app. We did just push an update, so it should have been updated.

(11:41 - 11:58)
Let's see if my accounts go, okay, the. That's weird, the logo looks strange on my phone anyway. Yay, perfect, okay, so we have one white screen fixed.

(11:59 - 12:14)
Well, that's good. Let's see if my transactions are still failing. Let's see if that's working.

(12:15 - 12:30)
Doesn't look like it's gonna work, because I know, because it takes too long. Yay, we have another white screen fixed. I think they should all be fixed, crossing my fingers.

(12:32 - 12:59)
The devs have been working on that all day, even though I was freaking out, because I didn't have the internet. I think I'm gonna try to start, somebody said Verizon's really good too, in my neighborhood anyway. Awesome, cool, so white screens so far have been fixed.

(12:59 - 13:19)
If you guys have any other issues, we are aware that transactions are failing, devs are working on that. If you have any other issues, or any new issues, please let me know. Sounds good, before and after, awesome, thank you.

(13:20 - 13:47)
What else, what else is going on? Any other questions, I'll check my email. Yeah, so I feel like it's been a week. Yesterday, I pretty much lost it on Apple, and then today I lost it on Cox, which is my internet service.

(13:47 - 14:05)
So I'm hoping tomorrow that doesn't happen. Hopefully there's not another tech emergency. I don't see any emails.

(14:11 - 14:47)
Buried messages, and Telegram, I don't think I see anything. Just a bunch of exchanges that want us, rather, that want our money. Flute, why you gotta be inappropriate? Wait, I might tip all, I don't even remember.

(14:56 - 15:18)
Let's Google it, it'd be exciting to be able to tip again. Be excited about something. Our dev, our main dev should be feeling better.

(15:19 - 16:23)
He has had COVID. COVID, that didn't work, how do I tip? I forget how to do this. What else, any other questions? Tip, tip, active, using, tip, excuse.

(16:24 - 16:49)
I like good messaging. These things are good, that's not what happened. And black charts don't look too shabby.

(16:51 - 17:07)
I don't know how, I should look at the volume. How much we had in sales this week. I wanna estimate like, say 15, 15 to 20K this week.

(17:08 - 17:50)
Does that sound about right? Oh, I think I found it. I think I found what I'm trying to do. That was supposed to work.

(17:52 - 18:35)
Our bot said that was supposed to work. Oh, that worked, yay, finally. Was that you buying back? No, I have not bought back.

(18:35 - 18:50)
Who bought, when, when was it? A few days ago, the crazy buys. I haven't been tracking who's been buying unless you guys tell me, so. But no, I have not bought back.

(18:54 - 19:25)
I feel like it would be, I feel like it would be unethical, kind of. Because when I do, then people will assume we're going live right then and there. Or if I don't, and people buy right after me, and I don't know, something were to happen, they'll claim that I, you know, was giving them financial advice, I don't know.

(19:30 - 19:48)
Okay, Russ, we still have, let's see, Babby's house. Let's get to the bottom of this channel. That's Russ right there, 4529, that's a nice, nice little wallet, gee.

(19:51 - 20:11)
Holy moly, holy smokes. No, I don't know who the buyer this week. I'm sure people here track it.

(20:12 - 20:28)
It was not me, though. I'm sure somebody knows. A question I have, is the USDT and the app tied to Ethereum? Yes.

(20:31 - 20:44)
And we are adding, we're adding other options to the app. We have a lot of great plans for the app. Just gotta get through the basics right now, and then we'll be adding.

(20:45 - 20:57)
But yes, that's why the fees to buy USDT are pretty high. High. Ethereum's a high-maintenance fee.

(21:02 - 21:22)
Yeah, that's pretty steep. And then if you use the smart wallet, it'll likely be a bit more too than the expert mode. Oh, that's actually what I was gonna check.

(21:22 - 21:37)
So we need to, the little, I don't know if you guys saw it, the little tool tips we added at the bottom of the app. Let me see if they pushed that through yet. I don't think they did, but.

(21:43 - 22:16)
Okay, so we still need to change that, because it's, the area you click on is like a little bit north of that little question mark. If you get, I'm getting DMs of the app asking you guys to enter the seed phrase to recover your wallet. If you do that, enter your seed phrase, not your VEST keys.

(22:31 - 22:56)
That's weird, I wonder how it got that. What do you mean it won't let you enter? Like it won't let you type in anything? Thank you, Voodoo Child. Do you wanna try exiting the app and getting back in there? Okay.

(23:05 - 23:34)
Yeah, the, it's, so we need to, the devs are working on that. You need to hit your screen, it's not, we need to make the clickable area a little bit larger, especially for most everybody, I think. But it's not on the, for me anyway, on my phone screen, I have a, I have an iPhone, I don't know what this 14, the larger 14, whatever that is, 14 Max.

(23:36 - 23:49)
I gotta click like a little bit north of the question mark, but it took a little bit of practice to do that. So just make that clickable area a little bit larger so that you can pretty much click anywhere. So.

(23:52 - 24:10)
Oh, perfect, awesome. That's weird, yeah, I heard Ultra Suede saying you have to press and hold. You don't do that on my phone, so I wonder, I wonder if that's like on different operating systems or what, but for me, I just have to click pretty quickly.

(24:12 - 24:25)
It's a beautiful chart, though. I think it looks really pretty, and our little card stack looks really pretty and very modern, it's crazy. It makes our old app look like it's like 20 years old, I think.

(24:26 - 24:33)
I haven't been around for a voice. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I don't think I've seen you for a long while.

(24:36 - 24:40)
Press and hold doesn't work for me. Yeah, it didn't work for me either. I wonder if it's an Android thing.

(24:45 - 25:20)
But excited about that, excited about the logos and the name changing, because I've been looking for my app typing PatriotPay. My tags in Telegram are still not working, so if I miss your tag, I'm sorry. It's been a bit, I see drama.

(25:21 - 25:36)
Well, you're welcome for the entertainment. Can always count on us for some action in here. I don't know.

(25:36 - 25:56)
Well. Advisor is, I think he's pretty happy with how everything's going. Just gotta, we'll just take prayers that it keeps going as smoothly as it has been on the tech side of things.

(25:59 - 26:21)
And yeah, it's so close. Part of me wants to say we pulled it off, but I think we'll wait until we're absolutely live. High-level recap.

(26:22 - 26:42)
We had some big developments this morning, tech-wise. Everything else we need to do from this point on to start testing is gonna have to be live. I'm just waiting on announcement video for the most part.

(26:43 - 26:51)
App devs are working on the app still. They did push some changes a few hours ago. I wanna say about two hours ago.

(26:54 - 27:25)
Is the blockchain advisor still around as well? Yes, that is who I am talking about. I think he's very, very pleased with how everything's coming about. Definitely, I wanna say it feels accomplished, but I feel like we should wait until we're live to say that, but it does, it feels great.

(27:27 - 27:41)
And the charts, charts look good too. Not too shabby. Need to check to see what the volume this week was.

(27:42 - 28:17)
By the way, did Universal Funds sell? I remember I've been waiting for the twos or two-two, double-two, I forget. Excuse me, I think it was always .0002 or maybe two-two, I forget, and that was somewhere in there. Invest support.

(28:24 - 29:05)
Yeah, if you all are not seeing your coins in your app, make sure you get to the bottom and switch that toggle. I'm glad we got everybody's wire funds straightened out. We still have till Sunday, and I think they work weekends.

(29:05 - 29:16)
I'm pretty sure, especially if they made their deadline of Sunday. Okay. So do let me know if you somehow think of some funds you have on wire.

(29:17 - 29:27)
Make sure you go to your bank statement and send me that transaction information. It should have, it should be on your bank statement. It'll say wire, and I believe it's San Francisco.

(29:28 - 29:39)
Make sure you send me that info if you're sending me that. Again, get your funds off XDNL Bank. If you know anybody who has FJB on those channels, make sure to tell them to get those off.

(29:40 - 30:01)
Time is really running out on that. We may have a few days, so if we cannot help you after XDNL Bank, decide that they are done and we are completely delisted. Other than that, don't share your seed phrase with anybody.

(30:01 - 30:07)
If you need help, we will never DM you first. Admins will never DM you first. They'll ask you to DM them.

(30:08 - 30:19)
We don't have a support handle by any means. And don't click on any weird links. If you're ever in doubt, please just ask in the chat so everybody can help you.

(30:22 - 30:31)
Don't ever send me your seed phrase or your pin. Please stop doing that. Certainly don't send them to anybody else.

(30:31 - 30:41)
I think you're kind of getting lucky if you're sending it to me. Definitely don't send it to anybody else offering to help you. And I think that's it for now.

(30:42 - 31:16)
If you need anything else, feel free to email, DM, tag me, text, call, whatever you need to do so we can get you taken care of. And then you have the app support channels in both Discord and Telegram now. So if you have any issues or if you run into anything, please let us know to help us get this app working and ready to launch it, to share it with the world, to grow the community.

(31:19 - 31:40)
Homestretch, again, please accept my personal apologies. Not testing in November, but it really is a, yeah, we can't, there's certain things we just really just cannot skip, so. But yeah, I think that's it.

(31:41 - 31:54)
You all have a wonderful night. Nice charts, nice job on the charts. Whoever you are doing all the buys, I'm gonna go check the volume though to see our volume.

(31:54 - 32:09)
I think our transact volume's gonna be crazy compared to the last few months. But yeah, I'll see you guys later. I'm gonna go eat dinner and head to a hockey game, so gotta go bundle up real quick.

(32:10 - 32:13)
I will see you guys in general chat. Have a great night.
