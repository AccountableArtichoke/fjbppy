Happy Friday. Hope everybody had a good week. I hope, thank you Stacey, I hope everybody's moved their funds out of Smart Wallet.

(0:19 - 0:41)
If you have any funds left in your Smart Wallet, including PPY, please go ahead and transfer it. Try to do it before the end of the weekend, for sure. Send out a few more reminders.

(0:45 - 1:32)
Trying to make this drink, but please move your funds out ASAP. If you do have PPY in there, go ahead and send me your transaction link to your transaction or even just your wallet address so we can get you taken care of. The sooner you do that, the better, but definitely try to get it done this weekend. 

It should only take really just a minute from your time. Let me know if you need any help. I'll be happy to walk you through it.

(1:36 - 2:51)
Move those funds, whether it's USDT, BNB, anything else, and PPY. So whatever funds you have in Smart Wallet need to be moved out. Now, a few of you have reached out to me with only a few bucks in there and are having trouble. 

So the issue is if you only have, especially anything on the Ethereum network, if you have just a few bucks in there and the gas is going to cost you more to move those funds out of there, then you're not going to have a successful transaction. So yeah, let me know if you have any questions or need help there and I'll be happy to help you get those funds out. Please try to get it done by the end of this weekend. 

Remember, if you do have friends or family, please let them know. Forward them my announcement or my contact info so I can help them go through the steps. You don't need to do that.

(2:52 - 3:34)
I know you all are busy too and I know it takes a long time sometimes. So feel free to forward my information, but don't do like you did with the LBank and XT stuff. Don't forget that one co-worker and that one friend. 

Please go ahead and forward that to them so that they can transfer their funds out of the smart wallet. That's so good. Okay, so the dev is still working by looking at some of your transaction of the transfers.

(3:35 - 4:40)
The dev's been working on some things this week as he's seen those transactions. Just a few little tweaks that way we make sure those are taken care of before we switch from Ethereum in the app right now to the Polygon. Basically just making sure we're getting taxes and gas calculated correctly so you guys aren't getting charged too much and so that the Patriot Pay wallets aren't getting charged it because eventually then they run out and if you guys aren't being charged enough for your gas and then that's when it sort of breaks. 

When the smart wallet function breaks so to say because there's not gas there to pay for your transaction so you can pay it back. He has been working on that. Thankfully everything's gone smoothly there.

(4:40 - 6:14)
We will give you guys a few more days to move those funds out and then as soon as we get right now we're just waiting on a contract from our new log account and wallet creation service that we're using. So if you've all kept up with the voice chats you probably remember that we have the contract we just needed the date on there to start. It is a pretty pricey service so we didn't want to start that service you know if we had started it when the dev finished the work it would have been a few months ago and that would have been a few months of service fees paid when we weren't using the service when we couldn't use it. 

So now we're just waiting on a contract back with the correct date on it so we can sign that and deploy that to you. In the meantime the dev will finish these gas estimation and tax estimations with the smart wallet. I'm also working on a function where we can sell part of the team funds instead of when we manually swap right now it goes ahead and empties the entire team wallet.

(6:16 - 43:06)
And once we're more steady we'll probably just keep that on auto but we do we would like to keep some coins so we'll be adding that function for us to be able to keep some patriot pay coins. Right now it's been easy to go ahead and pay out contests and things like that because we haven't burned all the unused coins yet so we've had that there but once we're done with the burn and paying everybody we won't have anything left in the main coin wallet so we'd like to still have some patriot pay and not have to not have to buy it. So he's working on that function and what was the third one? I forgot my notepad in the kitchen when I went out there for ice. 

It's getting so hot here by the way. Smart wallet oh and then moving like I said mentioning the moving the ethereum stable coins to polygons so that'll happen as soon as you all move your funds out we want to switch over so that anybody coming into the app and anybody that doesn't you know know a ton about crypto which will probably be the majority of our demographic that way when they go ahead and purchase usdt or usdc or you know any stable coins they're not paying a hefty fee with that ethereum and wondering why they're you know they ended up with 80 something dollars instead of the hundred dollars they just pay so I think that'll be great for everybody all around actually um can you tell if there are any people that still need to transfer um so yes however we can only tell we can only tell a smart wallet for the time being anyway um if you've transferred out of there or yeah transferred out of there um so if you haven't if you just get on your uh in your excuse me on your smart wallet and not I'm not even drinking alcohol I'm having like uh this active um got too many dms coming in at once um so yes we can we can't see all smart wallet accounts because of the way the smart wallet functions so the smart wallet address um the way that whole process works uh only happens after you all make a transfer out of your wallets um so if you go in there and just say buy something you don't um we can't see that we can't see that you have a smart wallet account yet but we'll give you guys a few more days to do that again if you know anybody um that had the patriot pay fjb app at the time uh please let them know don't wait till months later seven day outlook please asking for a friend um I haven't heard of any issues of you all running into issues uh trying to transfer your funds um I'm guessing those of you who had it's been user error because when we went ahead and walked through the steps it worked for you um so the only bugs we've had are really not bugs uh but more so adjustments that need to be made with gas and taxes um and those are issues we can see on chain so that's been nice for our dev and our advisor um to just watch that closely from there uh with all your transactions and get those solved or changed um so seven day outlook everybody's gonna listen and contact me if they have issues if they need help to move their funds out of smart wallet and then we're waiting on the wallet creation service uh I don't I don't estimate it would take them very long at all as soon as we get as soon as we sign that contract as soon as we receive it we'll sign return immediately um as soon as our api is activated we have that all already built and ready to deploy we've already um we've already tested that yeah uh so then we'll deploy that all to you now do keep in mind and I'll make sure to once we announce this to remind you all do keep in mind once you create well do keep in mind with this update with the new account creation wallet creation service you are going to have to make a new account now this account can be it can should be able to use the same email um you're using right now and I will double check on that um for you I'll give you again very detailed instructions but just keep in mind you are going to have to start a new account if you want a new app account and then currently this service doesn't have an option where you can access an outside wallet from this account does that make sense so you're you're not going to be able to make a new account with the new service and the patreon pay app and then access um your trust wallet or your um other account uh your expert wallet account so we had you guys move your funds to expert wallet and write your seed freeze so that's something that's just an account you can access from trust wallet um instead of having to act as the patriot pay app um so keep that in mind uh the the service does plan on having that function added uh before the end of the year so it will keep you updated on that um the nice thing is though you will if you do choose to make a new account using the new service you will be able to access that account from say uh metamask so that's nice um and it will be very very easy um so once you all test that hoping there's no bugs that need to be fixed from our side or theirs um we will then deploy our new on ramper um and have you all test that um with the wallet uh new wallet creation service i don't imagine this really is so straightforward um i don't imagine we'll have many bugs there um with the new on ramper um i do imagine we probably have more things there if any than the new wallet creation service just because um you guys will need to go through kyc there and obviously just the way that links in with buying you know patriot pay and limits and having that integrated with change now so there might be a few adjustments that need to be made there um but that's why we'll have you all test it and we'll go from there like i said it worked uh flawlessly when we tested it but it's only a few of us so of course it's different when we have several of you testing it and people in different states and you know different banks and different ids and all that but i think that'll hoping that'll be all in seven days depending on how each deployment goes because we don't want to deploy an update with if the update before is still having a ton of bugs that way the dev um it's easier for the dev to figure out what the heck he needs to fix and where you guys are having issues um what streb former president said after that guy set himself on fire that's awful um um once we switch over will there be an option for any stragglers to still transfer yes as uh mentioned before um that will be there will be a back end way but um um yeah unfortunately that depends heavily on third parties so this is why we need you all to move your funds out asap um yeah so we just don't run into any issues there um okay answer this yeah so the last day we're hoping that you guys can get your funds out by the end of this weekend and we will with what i've asked we will have an option for stragglers but we're not trying to get into it with uh third parties or past partners um so we'd like you all just to get your funds out asap if you know that friend or that co-worker and i know obviously if you're forgetting but uh yeah try to get my contact info to whoever um do you know that held ppy so we can take care of them um on-ramp deployment in april uh can or if everything tests uh as well as it should then yes we can't move on though to the on-ramp deployment if um the wallet and account creation service isn't uh working as it should but again should be pretty straightforward after we move smart wallet fjb do we need to start a new app address could we stick with trust war yeah so after sorry uh after we move smart wallet fjb do we need to start a new app address no you don't need to you can stick with trust wallet or metamask or do i need to start a new address to access my smart wallet fjb no that's why uh so the whole point you need to move your smart wallet funds not just your patriot pay but any funds that you have in smart wallet again unless it's just a few dollars and gas is gonna cost more than the funds in there so then your transaction is unsuccessful um but otherwise you need to move all funds out of your smart wallet to any other non-smart wallet preferably decentralized trust wallet metamask what are all the other safe pal or just an expert mode wallet because again expert mode wallet uh you won't be able to access using the app but you can use that you can access that uh through trust wallet or safe pal etc i sent you a dm if you can please read what okay if you can send me because that's a screenshot uh if you can send me the wallet address because if she also holds a baby fjb because that with that small amount that tells me that she may have gotten that fjb from reflections from baby fjb and that likely happened after the so that likely happened after we pulled lp and before we airdropped um especially with that small amount so that's likely what happened because unless uh unless you were a member of the scamming crew uh yeah unless you needed to pay us back some funds um absolutely every person received an airdrop and if you didn't then you got a very special number airdrop kind of disappointed none of you figure that out i had bet that no one would figure it out that was like my guess with the team but yes i guess even the favorite child disappoints you sometimes um but yeah send me that wallet address as a copy and paste please because that's a screenshot guess i can screenshot it and copy and paste it uh if you can wait for me after the uh the voice call i'll uh check it out um awesome i will i will check all your so i haven't um gone through your smart wallet uh transfer dms um if you did transfer your ppy out of your smart wallet make sure you also dm me your transaction or your wallet address so that i can have that get it all figured out send it and then dm me back oh you sent it to her okay i'll i'll check that um i dm'd you also how many smart wallet transfers have been made i'm not sure i could check the blockchain and find out no one says this nonsense i don't think so i i had high hopes that you would fit there's actually a few things but i'm surprised nobody's figured it out yet there's something that's like uh been out for months that nobody's figured out yet i imagine i would have heard about it by now and then the air drops too did anyone else have ppy disappear from their smart wallet i made two accounts with the app one i kept as expert the other okay so when did you last see a fjb balance and make sure you send me if you don't see your ppy in your smart wallet and you did have fjb before uh please dm me your wallet address if you haven't already that way we can get you taken care of is there a reason to move ppy to the app if we have it in trust wallet no okay yeah there's no reason to move your coin and um so actually in the current version of the app you can actually enter your trust wallet seed phrase into the patriot pay app and access that um we won't have that option once we with after the next deployment takes place but for the time being you can if you felt like it all done using cnc did i miss when bnb will get their uh it'll be by the end of this week they got a they got a few days left or i guess what less than a few days depending on what time zone or what you consider at the end of the week no i did not uh i did not have a previous working relationship with bnb before uh fjb uh i came across um fjb actually after i just uh lost my business i closed my business down several months later after coven when we uh figured that covid wasn't gonna be uh just two weeks or two months and uh sadly we were a very healthy lunch spot uh for the for the offices around the people that lived in the area uh weren't our target demographic uh it was mostly everybody who worked there who was now working from home so yeah closed my business um and then i came across fjb i think second day on a local uh local investing group andy had posted about it and then bnb came around um i forget if it was late november when i got in contact with them or early december but yeah that's how um yes please do dm me your smart wallet address um how did you manage to get in contact with them um actually i didn't it was um classmates of boris that got uh in touch with the old crew with the founders of the coin so it wasn't me who made the initial contact although uh boris lived here at the time but i cannot take credit for any of that god you guys have been uh so much nicer in dms and support tickets although it's a bunch of new accounts so i don't know if it's all of your friends and co-workers or or alts some of you made but either way i'll take it so you're thinking maybe monday for the um so trying to think if i've ever had weekend contact i don't think i don't think this company works weekends um honestly i don't think we've ever had any contact on the weekend from them um but yeah all i'm waiting is for them to send me the updated contract uh we will sign it as soon as we receive it and they um activate the uh obviously we need to make the payment um but i am very excited for that and excited for you all to see just how easy it is um how many various kinds of transactions in total do you figure will need to test before finalizing the app um i don't think we have a number um just as long as everything's moving smoothly because um we'll essentially continue testing it um through we'll make some contests um for new account creations uh new account purchases to make sure to kind of help you all test that um but even the way we're going about marketing um should help us uh test very gradually um to figure out any bugs but again with this it honestly should be the the wallet creation we expect to be so straightforward there shouldn't be much um for the devs to change their um the on-ramp or maybe a little bit different just because the way it's integrated and then you have a lot or a little more um i guess factors there with uh the new on-ramp or change now and then a few different uh things we have going on the app on how do you purchase uh ppy and then of course the other coins um and then you know add in wherever you guys live and kyc and all that kind of the way uh tranzac you know down to like tranzac's screen did this on the iphone it was too large on the android you know uh the little details like that so i imagine we'll probably have a few things possibly to change there with all your devices and uh everything there do you expect the contract and payment and implementation to happen to be next week for our new wallet creation yeah yes uh they they they're usually pretty quick i'd expect that uh early next week unless something drastic has happened on their end they're a pretty awesome company um i have not bet met both i've actually never met boris in person um is there any specific marketing that you're planning that will get the community excited beyond the big bannon war room promotions yeah i think um i don't know i've been trying to prepare everybody for i think we've gone through that but um um but basically how how gradually we'll uh start marketing so that we can um slowly work out all the bugs because we definitely don't want another um wire fire situation um did i miss it or has any uh on-ramp company been selected to replace transact yes um we have the one we've already implemented and then we have a plan b two companies actually in the run for plan b um that we're working on but yes the transact replacement is the one that we already have deployed and have tested that we plan on deploying after uh the new wallet account generation services deployed anything else oh i do have a question uh has anybody had bnb in their smart wallet before like bnb coin have any of you had any a bnb balance shoe did i get disconnected hello okay that's weird uh okay what the heck something's been on in okay looks like i'm connected again i think it's my vpn again um but has anybody moved bnb from their smart wallet looks like nobody has okay if anybody did have bnb in smart wallet please uh let me know reach out please that's weird i'm having people say they can't hear but i am connected now
