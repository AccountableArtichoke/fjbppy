Two of the most influential people in the country, in the entire country, on live. Live, live, live. On Discord voice. 

There's no other coin like this. It really is amazing for this to happen. So we're just going to be waiting a minute or so while we get all of the technical difficulties out of the way. 

We are going to get them up here live. Everything is going to be perfect. Everything is going to be set. 

It gives everybody another few minutes to be joining tonight, which is awesome. I'm pumped. You guys should all be so pumped. 

I love doing this. I love it so much because we get just more information. We get to hear right from them. 

It really is amazing. We got some people in the other general voice, so we got to get them to this chat. Stand by. 

How's everybody feeling tonight? We got a Thursday evening, 6.17 p.m. Eastern. I know we have people from all around the world, from Australia, Ireland, the West Coast. We have everybody here. 

So we are just getting this all figured out, all ready to go. I see that we have Boris in here. I do have Boris. 

I'm inviting him up to speak. We're also getting Mr. Steve Bannons as well. Did you get it? Hello, Grant. 

Boris, how's it going? Happy Thursday. Happy Thursday, team. How's everybody doing? So excited to be here. 

What a great week we're having. Such huge news announced this week with the mock-ups of the app. We're absolutely crushing it. 

Couldn't be more excited. We're growing this community. There's much more news coming in the next couple of weeks. 

We're doing exactly what we set out to do, which is combining the primal scream of FJB with making this the currency for the movement, which is unbelievable and exciting. Absolutely. Like you said, we have tremendous news. 

The app is monumental. I can't name another project that has done what is going on in the crypto world, what we have done in the first 95-ish days. It's really incredible. 

And it's because of the community. The community is so strong, and we have to keep growing the community and keep pushing. I just got a text. 

I think that we have to add him in here now. One second. Stand by for just a second. 

I'm looking. The crowd is large. Love it. 

Yes. I'm scanning through to try to figure out where he is. So he can look and look and hold him to request to speak so I can see his hand being raised.

(3:21 - 3:42)
I think this is the biggest community we've had yet on here, guys. This is so exciting. It's awesome. 

It's incredible. We had Eric on here also earlier this week. Love it. 

So we've been going. We've been absolutely going. I'm going to mute myself for just a second because Steve's guy is calling me, but I'll be back in one second.

(3:47 - 4:21)
Hey, guys. I'll talk to you for a little bit while Grant is getting Steve on. So here's what I want to say, that from the moment that Steve and I joined this partnership, we became part of this movement, become part of this community. 

All our focus has been on growing it, on making it bigger, and on, let's be honest, getting in the face of Joe Biden, getting in the face of the woke liberals, and providing a solution, a long-term solution for the MAGA movement from BNT Platform, BNT Bank, and that's exactly what we're doing. So proud of this coin. So proud of this movement.

(4:21 - 5:06)
I think we all know what happened to the other coin in the last 24 hours. Not so good, but that's what happens when all you want to do is play on memes and be funny. Well, what we're doing is we are expressing a very serious statement, expressing a very serious primal position on how we feel about Joe Biden, how we feel about the woke Democrats, but also building out this community, and we're going to be building it in a way that's really revolutionary and crypto. 

I love the mock-ups of the app. I urge you, if you guys have any ideas, absolutely let them be known, and we're going to take this home, and we're going to grow it in a way that's very, very exciting. Okay.

(5:07 - 5:10)
Boom. I see Steve. There you go.

(5:11 - 5:45)
Hey, guys. How are we doing? Steve, we're doing great. We're here with probably the largest audience they've had on one of these Discord Lives. 

I was just talking about the huge news we had this week as we're building out the community, and we announced the mock-ups of the app and how it is going to be so easy, so direct to be able to join the community to buy FJB. That's really been the biggest feedback we've gotten is that there's been some steps, some difficulty in becoming members of the community. So that was our focus from the get-go, and we're so proud of the progress.

(5:45 - 7:29)
Steve, with that, over to you. Yeah. No, I think we're building the infrastructure. 

This is a long-term play. It's to make sure that we can do transactions with this and eventually become an alternative store of value. So you've got to do the building blocks. 

That's why I think Eric Finman is a perfect, a great, as a strategic advisor, great augmentation to the great management team we've got, and we're going to be doing a lot more things like this, right? It's do the building blocks that makes this community robust, makes it resilient, and makes this an alternative, not just coin, but alternative currency for both transactions and ultimately store value. So I think, listen, you see the jam that the government's in right now with this complete nightmare where they have no real alternatives. No alternatives are going to be easy alternatives, so I think people, more and more and more people are going to say, hey, I've got to figure out some alternative way to do this. 

And at that time, we want to make sure, both for the ease of getting into the community, for the ease of getting coins, obviously we're doing a lot, but also for making this a robust alternative and having this accepted by retailers, have it accepted by people, is obviously our next big focus. Absolutely. Grant, I'll throw it over to you. 

Any questions that you've gotten from the audience, any input, any perspectives? I think it's a good opportunity for Steve and I to engage and talk about what the community has on its mind. Absolutely. Yeah, thank you guys for joining.

(7:29 - 8:12)
We are so tremendously excited, by the way. And if you guys have any questions in here, please, please, please shoot them in the chat. I've seen one reoccurring one so far today. 

And I think it's going around on Twitter that Joe Biden is trying to come down on Bitcoin. He's trying to regulate it. And he's saying that there needs to be executive action taken on it because he doesn't trust the form of currency. 

And people are asking what the common American can do to stop this because it seems like tyranny. It seems like he's trying to suppress what people want. He's trying to suppress new forms of currency while the U.S. dollar is not doing well.

(8:13 - 11:15)
That is a fabulous, that is a great question. So if the community didn't get a chance, I know a lot of you guys watch War Room, but if you didn't get a chance, please go back and see War Room this morning because it's one of the most important additions we've done. My interview with Christopher Leonard. 

Now, a lot of you guys who watch the show remember about three weeks ago, Politico did an excerpt from a book. Leonard's a business reporter. And if I can make a recommendation to this community for a book that you guys should get tonight and read, it's called The Lords of Easy Money, How the Federal Reserve Broke the American Economy. 

And to me, for anybody who wants to fully understand crypto and where the future of cryptocurrency is and the future of this community, read this book because it will show you how everybody in this nation under 40 years old is fucked. It is the Federal Reserve turned into a money printing, a money creation printing machine starting in 2010. Part of that was to save the Obama administration and save the elites in this country. 

But as importantly, it was to crush the Tea Party movement. The big decisions were made literally the day after the Tea Party revolt of 2010. And why does it have relevance today? You will see that this is really one of the main drivers for the Trump revolution, the financial crash in 08, and then the solutions for the financial crash, which were literally just to print money, but in the process, do rolling devaluations of this currency to the American middle class and working class. 

And this is why I'm saying that they're in a jam right now. There's no easy way out for where this economy is right now unless they want to continue to print money and to have these massive deficits, which I just don't think are politically feasible right now. So what does that mean? That they have, as I keep saying, they have forced the American people to look at two things, either precious metals as a hedge or cryptocurrency either as another way to do transactions, right, or as a potential store of value. 

And yes, I think right now that they're going to be doing everything. The Chinese central bank is, remember, they've outlawed Bitcoin. They're going to have a digital yuan or whatever, RMB. 

The U.S. government, you just saw this paper, everybody should read the paper that just came out the other day. I think they're going to try to very quickly, to the degree possible, try to start regulating Bitcoin and alternative currencies. I don't believe there's the political will to let it happen. 

Right now we have a blocking ability, and this ought to be a central issue. And if this community helps us make it, it will become a central issue in the take back of the House in 2022. Because right now, from the debanking, the deplatforming, all that, but most importantly, not to allow Americans to have alternative means of transactions and potential alternative means of stores of value, because it is mathematically impossible for that to be part of the dollar.

(11:15 - 11:43)
Remember, the purchase price, the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar is down 98% since the Federal Reserve has been incorporated back in 1911, 1913. In addition, I think it's down, the purchasing power of the dollar is down, I think, 8% just since Biden came into office, or from right before he came into office. So no, this is, it's going to be a huge issue.

(11:43 - 13:48)
It's one of the reasons I wanted to get involved in this, and particularly in this coin, the FJB coin, because one, not just a meme, but of our attitude, because I knew that Biden and the globalists have to, they have to, they have to get their grips now on currency. They already have the central banks, but that game is, that game is about played out. And they're at the, they're in a cul-de-sac. 

So they have to take control of alternative means. And this is going to be a massive global fight. I think the probability we'll be able to do it is, even with executive orders, to really enforce it through the courts. 

And that's why, and that's why this is going to be such a big political battle. So how would I tell you to get involved? Light your fucking congressman up, light your senators up, join Getter, get on the War Room Posse, be putting stuff up on our, on this channel, also on Telegram, everything related to this. Let's turn this into a, not just an economic community, but also a powerful political community, because this is the future. 

This is the future right here, there's no doubt. And we're going to be on the winning side of this, but hey, it's going to be a tough fight, because you can tell, you've got, listen, think about it. When you control an apparatus that can just create money out of thin air, and that's what they do, they just create it out of thin air, and give rolling devaluations to the people that put in all the labor, you're clearly going to try to keep control of that. 

If somebody comes up, hey, I got an idea, let's have an alternative digital currency that is not bound by your rules. First thing, how do we stop that out? These guys are like revolutionaries in 1776, right? How do we disembowel them? So no, this is the political fight of our time. That's why I got involved here, because this is going to be central to liberty going forward. 

Absolutely. Following up from that, the next question that I saw that I liked was what you mentioned, I think you mentioned it the other day on War Room, the value of the U.S. dollar decreasing by 98% in the past 100 years or so. Somebody asked, due to this, do you see FJB rivaling the U.S. dollar one day? Well, I see it being an alternative currency.

(13:49 - 14:08)
When you say rival, can it rival the U.S. dollar? Remember, right now, the one export we have, okay, let me say it a different way. The reason the United States is not Argentina is for one reason. It is because of the U.S. dollar, right? It's the prime reserve currency.

(14:08 - 19:04)
Every transaction in the world essentially has to be converted into dollars. It's one of the reasons that the Chinese are so focused on trying to get the digital-backed R&B to be accepted by the Gulf states, the Gulf Emirates, particularly Saudi Arabia, doing this huge deal with the reason they want the mullahs to do the output deals for oil with Saudi Arabia or with the mullahs in Persia. They want them to take a digital-backed R&B. 

Everybody's trying to figure out how to get off it, right? Number one, because we continue to do rolling devaluations of them. Number two, they don't like the control we have. Now, I think it was in May of last year, the total cryptocurrency transactions were greater than, I think it was on May 4th or 5th of last year, were greater than the entire transactions in dollars. 

I think it was over 3 trillion that day, which was a major emphasis. There will be a number of cryptocurrencies out there. I'm absolutely convinced. 

And the reason I've jumped in here, although I've owned other cryptos, I'm out of them now. The reason I'm involved in this is the fact that I think this is going to be a major alternative. And I think it's going to be the MAGA alternative, MAGA, which is 50% of the American people. 

And I think going to two-thirds of the American people pretty quickly. I believe strongly there'll be a number and a select number of cryptocurrencies out there as alternatives to the dollar, not for everything, but for certain things. And I think FJB is definitely going to be one of them, because I think our attitude is that we're the guys that stood in the breach and said, no, this regime is illegitimate. 

It's illegal. What they've done is outrageous. They've tried to destroy this country. 

We stopped them in their tracks. We're going to have a massive political victory before us. And once we do that, we're going to put these guys on trial. 

We're going to impeach Biden. We're going to impeach the rest of them, Merrick Garland and the whole rest of them. FJB in this community will be at the vanguard of this. 

And if we continue to do, I think what Boris and Finman are doing every day is looking how really you make the coin and the community itself more robust and more resilient. You make it easier for people to get involved. You make it easier for transactions. 

You start to build the depth of the capital market here. You start to get it so that NFTs can be done off it. You make it so that retailers accept it. 

So we understand there's a lot of work. There's a lot of pick and shovel work that has to be done here. Every day we're trying to do it and do it with the best exchanges and the best people that make it easier to use credit cards to actually buy this, make ease of transactions and transparency paramount. 

It's awesome. And another question, because we are a community in the Discord and the Telegram and the War Room Posse and things of that matter, people ask because they see the country, the way it's going, and it's just how downhill it is. And they said, what can we do to not only help this country, but the project and the community, the everyday coin holder that's already in the coin or looking to get in the coin? How can they help out? I think that's the overwhelming theme. 

Everybody should be right now, whether you're coming together, you're part of the War Room, you're part of this community, is be a force multiplier. This doesn't cost you any money. Right now, you don't need to spend any money. 

What you need to be is a force multiplier. And how do you get to do that? First off, you immerse yourself in this community. You immerse yourself in the War Room. 

You read all the things we put up. You get into these rooms. You start communicating with people. 

You start connecting with people. You start building a cadre. And in that cadre, you become evangelists. 

You get out there and tell the story. You say, hey, people are being debanked. You've got Mike Lindell, who's a billionaire. 

He's being debanked. You've got people being deplatformed. You've got an out-of-control Federal Reserve and a globalist elite that have this ability to just print money that are destroying the U.S. dollar and destroying our ability to have a store of value and the ability, ultimately, to do transactions. 

We are building something that's an alternative to that. So you become an evangelist for this. The way you do that is to learn as much as you can learn, communicate, connect, and then get out there and push the word out to people. 

If you believe in something, you've got to believe in it. That's why I say immerse yourself in the details. Ask the questions. 

Become as knowledgeable as possible. The way you fight back is quite simple. You become a vanguard. 

You become a cadre that gets out there and pushes out that, hey, we're not going to tolerate this illegitimate regime. We're fighting it every day, whether it's getting to the bottom of 3 November, whether it's getting to the bottom of the Wuhan lab, whether it's getting to the bottom of what the Feds did on 6 January, or explaining what this community is, what this coin is, what it means. And you'll get people excited about it and get them in, get them to buy some coins, get them in part of the community, get them into understanding what's going on.

(19:04 - 20:32)
And then we start doing NFTs. We start doing, we start getting it not just easier to own, but actually easier to use in transactions. Support those retailers, support the people that support the community. 

So it's a process. And that's why this is not, for anybody out there, this is not a real, there's issues with bots like there are in any of these, right? We're cleaning this stuff up. This is not a get-rich-quick scheme. 

This is a community that's building something for the long term, that's robust, that's resilient, that has staying power. And so if you want to act, what I tell people, become a force multiplier. And a force multiplier is really an information node that pushes information out. 

Remember, in life, people respect and admire people that are fervent believers in something and understand it and can make it accessible to them, particularly if it makes their life better. And what we're talking about are things that not just save our country, but make everyone's life better and particularly make life better for working class people in the middle class. Absolutely. 

That's awesome. Boris, you have anything to add to that? Boris is currently muted. Boris is out becoming a force multiplier right now. 

I think he is. That's a great question. I think it's just, look, this is, trust the process. 

This is, every day, it's a grind. Think about it. You guys watch sports.

(20:32 - 22:01)
What is the thing about sports? It's reps. It's teams coming together. But it's building, not just off momentum, but off grinding. 

And it's doing it over and over and over again. That's why certain teams play well in January, right? And certain teams don't. That's what this community is. 

That's what WURM is. I'm very proud that we punch way above our weight. We're going to punch way above our weight in this community. 

So the thing is now, take it upon yourself. Learn as much as possible. Connect. 

Get some people into the community. Get some people to buy some coins. Get some people that are sharing the information. 

Get people up to speed on what crypto is. Get people, I'm saying, read this book, The Lords of Easy Money, or go to, I put it up on my getter all the time, articles to push out that how the Federal Reserve and how the people that control the money supply are screwing you every day and screwing working class people every day. Get people, once people understand it, once people, remember, the one thing that the apparatus has never wanted to have is for people to really understand money, to understand banking, to understand how that ties together with the federal government, how the federal government finances itself, to understand capital markets, to understand the bond market, to understand the stock market. 

They want to keep everybody ignorant of that. That's why they make it so obtuse. It sounds like quantum mechanics. 

It's not quantum mechanics. It's all pretty straightforward. Anybody with common sense and just a fundamental basic knowledge can understand this.

(22:01 - 22:09)
That's what you should do. Make it, take it upon yourself. Good things are going to happen.

(22:11 - 22:41)
I want to echo everything Steve said. Steve is the tip of the spear in this movement, in the MAGA movement. The War Room Show has proven to be such a juggernaut. 

I said this on the show today, the most actionable audience, really, I think, in the history of media. What we've seen happen, I've said this before, I'll say it again, is that 2021 was the year of MAGA. 2022 is the year of MAGA on steroids under the leadership of President Trump.

(22:45 - 23:36)
The community, our movement is only growing. Why is it growing? Because of action. This is the purpose of that primal scream of how we feel about this movement, how we feel about it right now. 

We're saying, fuck Joe Biden, fuck the Democrats, fuck the libs, fuck the woke bullshit. We are focusing on the future. It's the combination of that primal scream of how this community and making us the currency for our movement, for our community.

(23:36 - 24:13)
I think the app, the direct opportunity to join the movement, to buy the coin through the website is going to be revolutionary. We're only going to build from there. It's only going to get bigger from there. 

You've seen this, the dichotomy couldn't be clearer in the last 24 hours in what's happening with our movement, the FJB movement, and what's happening with the joke LGB coin that they had. They try to pump it, dump it, whatever they're doing with it. They're not viewing that as a serious endeavor, as we are seeing this as a serious movement, as a vital movement, and as a movement that takes our MAGA community into the future.

(24:21 - 27:00)
Sure, sure, sure. Okay, let's do one more. I got one more. 

I got an email today, actually, from somebody saying, hello, I am an avid watcher of The Real Room, and I love the FJB idea. The only question I have is I'm unsure on crypto and would love to know more about it. Do you have any recommendations of something that I can read or watch to get a better understanding of the coin and cryptocurrency as a whole? Thanks so much. 

Keep fighting for America. Well, I mean, there's a whole host of articles and videos that we can put something together. I think the community ought to also put their thoughts in the best articles, the best videos, we want to put it out so people that as you become an evangelist, we have something people go through. 

A number of articles, I think, explain crypto pretty well. I think it's one of the big things we have to, particularly older people that may not be that, was it facile with technology or understand blockchain or anything like that. I think we have to go out of our way to get back to the fundamentals and really explain this. 

But yeah, there's a number of great articles, a number of great videos out there from various people, and I'll pull them together and give them to Boris, and we should get that to people and we should go out of our way to explain it. To me, we should conduct regular seminars. This is the way you build a community. 

There's a lot of people out there that would love to know about this. They feel intimidated or scared. They just put a report out today. 

I saw Axios, the corporate mouthpiece for the Washington Convention on Thinking. The evening Axios markets summary, the number three story is scams have gone up. The FTC, I think, or the SEC has looked at scams. 

And of course, they're not focused on the stock scams and everything that Wall Street's doing. They went immediately to crypto. So they're going out of their way to try to crush crypto. 

We just got to understand something. The powers that be, the central apparatus wants to kill crypto because they understand crypto is a major foundational element for the liberty movement. And they want to de-platform everybody from Joe Rogan to Mike Lindell to President Trump, to everybody. 

They want to de-bank people and they certainly don't want to see the growth of crypto. We got a fight in front of us. But hey, I like our odds and I like the people on our side of the football. 

So I'm ready. I'm down for the fight. That's why I got involved in FJB.

(27:00 - 28:58)
I can't think of a better thing to fight for in crypto than something that says, fuck Joe Biden. Absolutely. Thank you guys so much for being here. 

Any closing words, Boris, before we hop off today? I just want to say I want to thank this community. And I'm always so proud to thank the War Room audience, thank the MAGA movement. But I want to thank this community, thank all of you, not just for getting on today, but for being so involved, for posting the memes, for posting the information, posting your feelings and your strength in this movement. 

And let's continue to fight. It's all about the fight. We're not backing down one inch on every front. 

And this is going to be a major tool, major weapon that we are using as we grow the FJB movement, as we grow the MAGA movement, and as we take ourselves into the next year, five years, 10 years, and into the next century. Steve talks about 100 seats, 100 years on the house. Well, that 100 years is going to be the 100 years of MAGA. 

And I'm convinced that FJB is going to be a huge part. Thank you all so much, and God bless. Take to whatever you're on, call somebody up, let somebody know about FJB, because we have to become multipliers to let the world know what we're doing and why we're here. 

Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Rock and roll, guys. 

Thanks so much. Thank you so much. Have a great night, everybody. 

I'm absolutely pumped. You guys are incredible. Thank you so much. 

Good night. Talk to you guys soon.
