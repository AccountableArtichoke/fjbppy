[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Okay, so who are the current stakeholders in the project and what methods of communicating updates to them have been put in place? I'm not sure if this is talking about BNB.

Again, team texts are constantly ongoing on a daily basis, minus the weekends. What is the timeline for making a decision regarding the LP by end of year? Crossing our fingers for that.

What is the expense percentage breakdown by expense category? Not currently available. I do know our development and legal costs are the largest by far.

Is there a new path forward by quarter on what actions objectives are planned? Yes, we hope to have a out soon. Relatively soon, just a few priorities beforehand.

Not that the white paper isn't a priority. But kind of things that kind of need to take place beforehand, so to say, like the tax structure, revamping the website, social media, firing that back up, the app, Ethereum gas issue with the gift cards, applying to booths at events, partnerships, basically all these things that take time and need to be planned ahead of time. Basically, we're doing work that should have been completed in the last 12 months.

So we're trying to get that all done as quickly as possible. And also a lot of still organizing, just a lot of admin work, paperwork, legal paperwork to make sure everybody has that signed, that kind of stuff. Next question, off ramp update.

Somebody says as per a transact tweet, they are suggesting mid Q1 2023. Matters needing resolution. Basically, we're just waiting on a proposal or quote from Fireblocks.

They're not the easiest to get a hold of. So last I spoke to them was yesterday. We have so we had a few questions about the legal proceedings.

Have official proceedings toward regaining missing funds commenced? IE have documents been lodged? Not.

No documents actually filed yet. There is an ongoing investigation with an entire team working on this. I got great update about that yesterday.

So I am feeling great about that. It is definitely not being ignored. It's definitely not getting brushed under the rug, which is excellent to hear.

And we will keep you updated on anything we can. But this is as I said way earlier, this will take some time. And the investigation is ongoing before they file everything.

We will let you know as soon as anything is filed. Anything I'm able to share with you, I promise I will. But I am absolutely pumped about that.

Please do make sure in the and it would definitely hurt us. We don't want any, you know, kind of defamation or anything like that. I'm very, very excited and very hopeful about this.

Next one, Velo and Dev Priorities. Somebody says they understand that Ethereum gas issue is urgent. What else are they working on?

The list from a month ago was must haves. I'm not sure if this is talking about the list that was before we discovered our funds were missing, but we've changed a lot of that. So right now, yes, that is all they're working on.

And I know it sounds like that's crazy, like, oh, that's all they're working on is the Ethereum gas issue. But yes, the smart wallet is a big deal. And we have several people.

Sorry, just counting in my head. Yeah, reading going through that code and reviewing it. And testing should be this week.

Again, we are adding a few more devs to help out to get this process rolling a little quicker. But obviously, other devs to have other projects. An example, one of the devs we have working on this was supposed to get back to us at the end of last week.

They ended up getting back to us yesterday and today because their other project took longer. You know, this is just kind of part of the game. I understand I'm asking for a lot.

You guys have been beyond patient, which I appreciate. But that's just kind of comes with it. So yeah, I think that answers that question.

Somebody says also, there's a rumor that Velo is done and we have a new dev want to ask about that. Nope. Velo is still here.

We are adding new devs to help. And we are still in negotiation with everybody else. So yeah, Velo is still here.

I think that's all the questions that I had answers to. Let me know. Let me see.

I'm going. Let me know if you have any other questions. I do appreciate your patience.

I think we're going to take advantage of this bear market and really, truly become the best coin and app we can. A lot. I know a lot of coins that I was in.

And you know, these alt coins have really ended these last few months. Just they really just couldn't keep up. And I think we owe that to you, the community.

We are doing the best we can with what we have to work with. And of course, our volunteers. Volunteering their time and tremendous skills.

And I think a lot of it has to do because we're all here because we believe in the same values. And I really do truly believe that'll pay off. In my opinion.

Will it take time? Yes, absolutely. I've said that for, you know, quite a while.

We've been knocked down time and time again. And it's going to take time to not only clean up everything, but work on these foundational items while still moving forward. But I think we're really doing a great job and getting a ton done.

Should have this stuff been done, you know, five, six, seven, eight, twelve months ago? Yes, absolutely. I agree with you.

But that's all we can do now is move forward. And we honestly have been. I have tremendous faith in that.

I think everybody on the team right now and every volunteer truly has that goal in common. And I think that's a huge deal. Yeah, a lot of that is even goes back to like these things taking time on the back end, drafting the appropriate legal paperwork, you know, to our contractors and to our volunteers, to getting accounts properly set up because they weren't set up correctly.

But I really, truly still believe this is the best position we've been in for a very, very long time. I think it's good to remember that all of crypto is in the bear market. So taking advantage of this and helping, you know, us build back up and taking advantage of this time while everybody is down.

I think it's going to work in our favor. I really, truly believe that, in my opinion. It's going to take time and I think we're getting better every day.

Somebody says, will the white paper and new website be released before the end of the year ish? The website definitely will be absolutely the white paper. I'm not sure.

I'm not sure we'll be able to get that before the end of the year. If you anybody here listening would like to volunteer to help write, if you're any kind of good writer, or edit the white paper, please reach out. Taking any kind of volunteers, that would be a huge help.

How are we paying for the website? We have a volunteer working on it as far as hosting and everything like that. I'm currently paying and will be reimbursed through the marketing wallet.

Currently paying through my personal bank account. I think that's what you're asking. What is this Kanye?

I didn't watch it. Ed says, would we launch without off ramp? I believe so.

I don't think that's a huge deal. I know they really wanted that because they didn't want the left to go after us. But I don't, I'm not sure it would be in my opinion.

I think that would be fine. You know, just go to BNB and then off ramp. I don't think that's a huge deal to swap and then off ramp.

But that's just my opinion. All right. Any other questions?

I'm pretty sure I went through all of them in my inbox. If I missed you, please feel free to. Oh, somebody said does the app approaching launch ready?

Yeah, it's again, the smart wallet is really, really huge deal. I think that'll be, I think that'll be huge. I'm not sure what bugs will come up after that.

But I don't think we'll have a problem. At this point. We're just hoping that funds can cover this cost.

Any word on the rally booth coming up? I think you're talking about the Phoenix one. I sent them an email this weekend.

And then again, yep. And then email yesterday to follow up. I have not heard back yet.

If I don't hear back from them directly, I will have BNB or somebody from BNB's team hook us up that way. Because right now we're just sending emails directly from the FJB emails. I'm hoping that they're not just completely booked.

I need to figure out how to do music on telegram. Like we do on discord. Go ahead and play take down the CCP.

I see a few people off ramp or not. We are waiting for fireblocks to get back to us with a quote. And transect says they're off ramp will be live soon.

I contacted them regarding that today to see if that includes us. How are merch sales? How's merch sales gone?

Pretty good. Awesome. I figured we'll probably start a contest tomorrow and run it through maybe either Friday or Sunday for the weekend.

And I think it'll be cool to do a maybe like a raffle like you get a raffle ticket maybe for each 10 bucks we spend and then we'll do like 1 million FJB giveaway or something like that. We're I think Yeah, it's great. And I think it'll be great to help us out of this, you know, little debt hole.

Our social media should be fired up starting December 1 or by then. So that's super exciting. I can't believe it's almost December.

So we're super excited for that. I'm sure that'll start bringing some people in again. I think I think quite a few people.

That's how they heard about us. And I'm excited for everybody to get their merch. I actually still need to order mine.

I just haven't made the time. I'll probably do it tonight actually. And I actually need to.

So I'm applying for an event. Well, I'm almost done with the application. I'm waiting on a we need a photo of our like a booth setup.

But this one is in April. So it's crazy how far ahead of, you know, of the events they want these done. But I'm really excited for that one.

So if we get that one, which I hope we do, then we'll have to order pre-order merch and gift cards, which will be so awesome. I think it'll be great. It's a festival that's for maybe five days actually.

It's either Wednesday through Sunday or Thursday through Sunday. Well, Bannon shall merch for FJB with all proceeds going to develop the coin that fights for America. I hope so.

I think that'll be really cool. We're trying to get Bannon some shirt and pins. A lot of that is hard because if you have pre-existing contracts, it'll depend on what those contracts, you know, those contracts can prevent you from shilling other things.

But we're hoping for my pillow code. That would be really cool. We're waiting on that.

We did get an update from them today, so I'll confirm. And a few other partnerships. Really cool.

I had a long call yesterday with a somebody most of you know. That's really, really awesome. And he's, he feels great about this bear market.

In a way, sucky because he too has lost a ton of money, but he's not one bit worried. You know, he's watched this play out several times over. And he's just says, do you know what?

You guys need to hang out and take advantage of this and do everything you can do in this year or two to prep for the next bull run. And, uh, he, I think, uh, makes a great point. We also have a really big call still coming up this week that we hope something comes out of too.

I'm really excited for that one too. So a lot of things happening. I think everybody kind of, uh, cool down for a few days, got off the computer, spent time with family, which is great for our bodies and our brain chemicals and our hormones.

And subconsciously, I think everybody feels, it seems like everybody feels a lot better, which is awesome. Okay. I don't see anybody typing anymore.

So I think that's all the questions. Um, and I think that's all the updates I have, um, looking through my list in case I missed anything. I don't think so.

I don't think so. We're excited. Um, I think you all will love the new tax structure.

Um, partnerships we have coming up, I think will be amazing. And I think firing up social media will be really, really fun again, um, for us just to go out, chill, um, watch the left lose their mind. It'll be really cool to watch them on Twitter because before we got shadow banned and we'd have so many bots reply.

So I'm excited for that. Awesome. Well, thank you all again.

I will be Friday. I think we'll have our scheduled regularly scheduled Friday night date on discord live voice. In the meantime, I'm here.

So feel free to DM or ask any questions in chat. Again, sorry, sometimes if I see your questions in chat, I'll just save them. Um, if I'm not having, you know, the time to reply and that way everybody else can get those answers and help everybody else out.

Keep everybody else in the loop. I appreciate you all have a wonderful night. Thank you.
