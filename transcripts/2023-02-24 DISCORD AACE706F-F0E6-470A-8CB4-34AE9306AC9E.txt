[Speaker 2]
All right, I got the recording going.

[Speaker 1]
I'll wait till 5 30, well 7 30 most of your time I think.

[Speaker 2]
How's everybody doing? I'm almost done with my energy drink. I have pop-ups from telegram.

Somebody's very unhappy. This is why I never never go to discord channel. Oh okay.

[Speaker 1]
All right, well it's 5 or 7 30 eastern. Happy Friday. Thank you for your patience while we got on here, while I got on here and gave everybody an update.

Kind of clear everything up as much as I possibly can. So please don't go after me for any lack of details. But I told you all before the end of the year and when the year started that we are, I am again trying to figure something out with B&B so we can get on some sort of schedule so we're not left in this limbo and we got that done.

So you know unfortunately sometimes you have to take a step back to take a step forward and I understand that the lack of details for the community have been very very frustrating to say the least. I do sympathize with you. I also understand why it's so easy for most to make me the scapegoat.

Although things might look that way I can promise you that's not the case. Yeah so B&B are very happy with FJB as it is. They are very happy with the news article also and they wanted actually within the last hour to make sure that I let you all know that.

They have been super involved. They are making commitments and putting those in writing. Somebody says what news article?

The ABC article and then a few have picked it up. I know Rolling Stonehouse, a few others. Sorry getting back to um so anyway within the last hour they wanted to make sure to let you all know that tonight.

I got a few questions and DMs regarding why have B&B you know kind of been away for a while and honestly that's just they've been that busy. Again I did let everybody know in the new year we are working on a schedule to make sure we don't have this issue of being in limbo and we've got that figured out. We are just working the fine details and we will have a schedule for how involved B&B are which is very I'm sure you've seen by the everything you've seen on War Room.

There's nothing as far as me against B&B. I know I've seen that swirling around. B&B are very aware of that and I've seen several people also write to Boris.

I think his assistants should have gone gotten back to everybody by now and let you know to contact me whether that's through DMs or our official FJB email just to make sure that we all have your ideas in one place. Yeah we still have the you know we still have the group overseeing everything that will uh Boris's team is very aware of and again I think you'll be getting I think you all will be very pleased with the future and like I said what was promised as far as B&B having something scheduled for how often we get to see FJB mentioned. You know a lot of people have mentioned oh my gosh how do we not have these TPUSA contacts and um other contacts like that.

Everything like that is being planned and we will keep you updated on all of that. But again they're both very happy. Yeah that's Legata posted Rolling Stone.

They posted I believe pretty much the same article that FJB they wrote about FJB or ABC's article. So yeah I hope that like I said I understand that some of it might be a little confusing but the good news is we do have a plan and B&B have been more present than ever in doing uh what the community has been asking for and I think you will see a lot more of that um and I think you'll be very happy about it. Let's see let's um they're gonna do something.

Somebody says are they gonna do something besides War Room? That did nothing. Yes obviously I did let them know our app is not very functional right now so they did not want to tell their War Room viewers to download the app because that wouldn't make sense for us.

But we will be getting on social media and War Room getting out more information on Baby Steps. But we are on a schedule we will share that as soon as we can and it's a great start. Can you update on I think you're asking about the missing funds.

I do not have an update on that. I will let you know as soon as I have an update and as soon as I can share an update. What was the announcement you posted and deleted twice all about and why did you sell coins?

I sold coins to help fund the project and my announcement was deleted so that's something I am not able to discuss but like we said um yeah B&B are honestly more involved than they've ever been as you see and I'm more involved as I've ever been. I am not going anywhere. I've said that over and over again in my announcement.

I never hinted at me leaving or ever thought about that. I did have to sell some coins in case we needed funds. Why it's been months I believe regarding the missing funds.

I cannot answer that but I'm sorry I wish I had an answer for you but as soon as I can share anything regarding that I will. I promise I'm not trying to hold secrets or be secretive but there's only so much I can share so please don't kill the messenger. How would you selling coins help fund the project?

Yeah everybody wants I think Sherlock answered that. Nobody wants FJB as payment or if they do they want that as some sort of tip and I need to continue paying folks for their work. Can you provide an actual update?

Big plans is not acceptable. Please don't kill the messenger. I can only share what I am able to so I know a lot of people were asking for clarification and that's what I'm providing so I'm sorry if that is disappointing to you.

I think again it's clear with us being mentioned on war room B&B are here and I am too. With the marketing wallet now have a lot of money to pay for devs. When do we get the app fixed?

We're interviewing devs as we speak. When big plans after small plans. B&B are busy people.

We are getting everything in writing so we can move forward. Somebody says should honestly ditch the app and use that money for marketing. When call center.

Finn is a great man. Somebody says I don't want to be a Debbie Downer but this seems like the same voice call. I mean I'm sorry you feel that way but we've also not been on war room several times in the last year so I just wanted to clear up and B&B wanted to clear up to everybody that they are still here.

They are not leaving and we are getting a plan for the year like we promised like I promised to you back in January. We're heading towards the end of February now. I told you I apologize it was taking so long but it was us you know we didn't want B&B getting on for one week or one shill.

We were really trying to get something scheduled for the future so we are not in limbo any longer. So it's not a one-time shill a one-time appearance and I think that's a big step forward guys. Sounds like more on the way after discussions are finalized.

Yes like I said everything has been decided on we are just getting everything in writing and I'd like to get that all in writing before we go ahead and share with you. Diesel says no updates no news. I'm sorry you feel that way.

Ben has a girlfriend. You talk a lot and then at the same time say I'm sorry you feel that way again. I understand your disappointment and I understand emotions are still high but a lot of people have been asking for clarification of the last few announcements and that's the information I can provide right now.

Please don't kill the messenger. I understand that's a part of the position I'm in. I totally understand that and I totally understand why a lot of you feel this way but this is what I can answer right now.

They are going to work us into they're actually even have that answered right now. They are going B&B are going to make sure even with you know the the midterms in the past and now they have the 2024 Trump campaign they have promised and I do believe it to work us in where they will still make FJB a priority moving forward. Who owns the rights to FJB?

B&B do as of now and for the foreseeable future. Why post the announcement and then delete? Like I've said earlier I'm sorry I cannot share any more details with you.

If I could I would. Just know that B&B are here and are still the owners. I think they've shown their involvement in the last week and a half or so and they and that's just the beginning.

So FJB is staying no name being discussed anymore. The rebranding is still the plan so that way we can move on with marketing. The whole reason behind rebranding is so we can actually be accepted.

A lot of vendors although they did not give us an answer nobody has given us that reason. We do believe that many people although they you know think FJB is cute or fun and funny don't want to be associated with that due to other vendors they have which is understandable. I'm not sure who you are Goku but I am not able to answer these questions I'm very sorry.

FJB and Trump 2024 campaign yep they are working on the 2024 campaign which is a huge deal. They do not show any involvement a few blurbs on war room. So again I know our mentions on war room have not asked folks to go ahead and download the app or I mean I think Bannon has said to buy FJB but if you know anything about marketing then you know about repetition.

We are on board and with weekly shills that will get done. The more people hear FJB they hear it again and again and again the more they hear it the more they're gonna start wondering about that. So I understand you know the price didn't blow up after one or a few war room shills but this is why we're getting something to make something happen on a weekly basis.

This is a long-term deal. You will keep asking what? I've already answered your questions two times I'm not sure who you are but please come back with your regular screen name.

I've been doing great curious if you all have heard from Grant at all lately. No I have not. He does not have any involvement as far as I know.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry I'm still reading through everything.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have an estimate of when the scheduled shilling starts or war room? It already has. We are just as you see we've been mentioned the last few weeks.

We will share in more detail after we get everything in writing. Is the project team hiring for any positions besides app developers? I know right now we're definitely looking for a dev and we have a few volunteers.

I don't know that we are hiring for anything else but please reach out to me in dms or email. Estimate of when everything will be in writing complete? I would guess in the coming week.

Has a developer been found for the app? No.

[Speaker 2]
If you know anybody reach out.

[Speaker 1]
Is a marketing wallet being readied for app development? Yes absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
We already have let's see and then somebody was interested in an event coming up or they needed let's see about 150 gift cards so that should be nice.

[Speaker 1]
That goes through. Will LP be locked when everything in writing completed? I do not have a time for you to be completely honest and I don't want to give you a wrong time estimate.

How one sell somebody sold 80 million coins and then bought back in at 300 million coins one hour later? Was it you? That was not me.

I'm not sure who that was. I'm sure you can ask the wallet trackers but no that was not me. I just tuned in.

Is Velo still a developer of our app? Velo still helps us. He is a little bit too busy.

Are we doing a full launch on war room? We are going to have scheduled appearances on war room on a regular basis as promised. How they know?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. How are they? I don't know what you're talking about.

[Speaker 1]
Oh probably the 80 million. I'm not sure and I honestly don't know who that is. If you do know feel free to DM me.

Baby FJB Connection still in talks? Yes absolutely. I believe as soon as they're ready to have their accounts they can be added to the app.

Would the team consider moving to a different blockchain? One where investors wouldn't have to pay a fee for transactions with the blockchain? Totally gasless.

More than BNB? I mean anything's a possibility. If you have any ideas go ahead and DM me or send it to our FJB email.

ETA completion of our app for real? I can't answer that and to be honest even Velo couldn't answer that when he got on our last voice call that he joined just because I mean bugs will come up. Our app was fully functional and then some bugs came up so it might be something super simple.

Oh goodness. Who are all these new names? Was Velo contracted and paid by the hour or by the project?

Hourly. Did he not complete the app because of contractual dispute or because it was beyond his capability? No absolutely not.

Velo is a genius and there was no contractual dispute as far as I know. No absolutely not. He's a great great guy.

When you say scheduled appearance on war room does that mean like five minutes at a time like how they do with Birchgold? Those details have not been made clear but as soon as they are I will share that with you. How much FJB do we pay BNB for scheduled appearances?

Oh boy. Hi Ronnie. We doing any more charity donations?

We definitely can. Absolutely. When popcorn is.

I don't know you're not ready. In your view is the project in a good position? We have been on a roller coaster not a good ride for a long time.

Yes I absolutely agree with you and I do thank you for your patience. I think and like I said earlier I think sometimes we have to take a few several steps backwards to take some steps forward and I think really we are finally at that place. I think the war room appearances are a huge indicator of that and that's just the beginning.

I think that's yeah instead of just something that's scheduled and something that got moved along I think that's a huge huge indicator being mentioned on war room. Yes I understand we didn't see a huge spike on the charts but again that's kind of how marketing works. I read a few comments on the social media the war room social media where they will all will also excuse me too much celsius energy drink be posting about fjb on the war room social media and folks are asking on there where they can buy it little by little.

I think that will be great for us especially when we are featured weekly and multiple times a week and that way we can grow organically slowly and this will this is good for us in many ways. I understand we'd love to see you know a day like wire when people are coming in like crazy but I think this will be great for us like Velo said even as far as the app goes because we can find bugs and fix them before thousands of people are just left in limbo like they were with wire. Okay who's this guy we're gonna I think it's time to goku this is your last warning sir I'm not sure who you are but I'll be banning on the next one.

You had no idea war room was going to happen I was very aware like I said I'm sorry I cannot share the details but please do not kill the messenger. I promise you that the community has has and will remain my number one priority although it may not seem like it that is all I can say the community's best interest remains my number one priority and B&B know that uh and know the facts and that's why we're all still here love you too. Is Dev Newman still involved?

Yeah so uh no man I think he yeah I think you pronounce it I actually think it might be not man the way you actually pronounce it but I'm not sure totally assuming um but no man no man um or Newman uh has not been on discord I did try emailing him this morning so we hope to hear back he is on the east coast so but he was an uh he is an amazing dev. Any word from Transac about off ramp? Um no we have not received the last update we received from them was that they will keep us updated um as expected it's taken longer than we expected kind of like a lot in the crypto world or really in any business world right and again I do want to say I do apologize for the roller coaster of emotions but I can promise you that um everything has been done for the best interest of the holders and the coin although it may not seem that way um and you know sometimes you don't have all the facts and I understand how frustrating that can be um but uh I am being 100% honest when I say that and B&B are very aware of that.

What triggers selling from marketing wallet? I don't think anything just triggers that I think we kept that those numbers in there for so long uh we're just trying to sell on a regular basis so it's not so much of a dump and that way it doesn't impact the charts as much. Will we be waiting for off ramp before scheduled launch on war room?

No uh not to my knowledge. Transac tax going away we are a working with them on that it's been a few days I believe it should be but I will update you as soon as that happens also I know um MP uh thank you have a great night oh I just freaked out for a little bit because I thought my recording stopped but it did not. Finishing my Celsius probably shouldn't not this late uh and now we will go back to doing Tuesday and Friday voice chats uh just as a Q&A update we'll uh start that back up as of tonight.

Are tax wallets multi-sig wallets or single owner controlled? Uh single owner controlled and I do want to reiterate again that um B&B and their team have been more active than they have been um the entire time I've been here which is I mean honestly since since I've started uh at least since August and I say since August because before that I was only in certain uh text threads with them you know like FJB social media and FJB um where now I'm in every single uh text thread with them and I can tell you um they've been more involved and more happy about the project than I have ever seen them um and I'm being completely honest about that. Sarah you put up a message that suggests FJB is being sold reassigned you then sell a bag straight after at the same time the coin tanks and there is no current reason or answer being given for any of that this is people's money not just some gig yep I understand that since I've spent over $150,000 into the project also uh do you think this is acceptable can you understand how people think this stinks? I do think this is acceptable yep because again I gave my reasoning in the announcement that I needed to sell my coins to uh continue funding the project I have put enough of my own funds straight from my bank account to pay the bills so um I wanted to offset that a little bit and uh that needed to come from my FJB wallet that was down gosh knows how many percent I don't want to calculate it but yes I absolutely think that is acceptable unless one of you is willing to put the funds up to continue paying the bills and fund the project can you understand how people think this stinks?

Absolutely I do um I have said that several times throughout this voice and I understand uh everybody is upset because you don't uh have all the details or the facts and unfortunately I cannot share all of that uh but I can assure you that the best interest of the community and the coin has remained my number one priority um and I was honest about that I was 100% honest about selling my coins to be able to continue funding the project um when I've spent more than 150k and sold my coins for close to nothing um I was at a point where it's like all right I'm gonna ride this out even if it goes to zero because I'd lost so much at that point um so it truly was not to oh get my coins out because what is 10 12 grand it truly was so I have some funds um with the plans at the time oh thank you that's nice why isn't marketing wallet funding um it is at the time our marketing wallet did not uh have much uh thank you applejack I am not perfect by any means but uh sincere and genuine and uh honest and integrity are qualities that I uh love about myself not her money track it back I'm not sure what that's about you are very welcome Cajun dog thick skin yep

[Speaker 2]
do you have an ownership position with FJB apart from your coins um not at this time

[Speaker 1]
why say B&B are gone if you were honest um I cannot answer that

[Speaker 3]
um

[Speaker 2]
uh why can't you explain why you are using your own money instead of B&B uh thankfully we do have

[Speaker 1]
the marketing wallet uh back and hopefully uh all the marketing and war room shills will help us with volume so I no longer have to do that or to the extent I have been doing um that's really just all the answer I have will the tax be restructured before scheduled launch um I am not sure but I will keep you updated this uh past two weeks or so have kind of um been a whole new start in many ways for FJB and I think uh it's been very very good even if just the appearances on war room when did Don Jr. purchase the coin I'm not aware of that when launch uh I will keep you updated we are getting uh everything in writing um interviewing devs and seeing if we can get some of our devs that have previously worked uh on the app back and uh we'll keep you updated why did I sell to continue funding the project like I did in my original announcement it killed me to sell um I was absolutely sick to my stomach and cried a few times that morning before I sold it was not what I wanted to do especially with as much money as I've put into that do you expect more regular voice chats to start again soon now that you're ironing out details yes absolutely we um sorry I mentioned that earlier we will start that back up this as of today when youngest bitcoin millionaire come back oh I love Finn I wish he would come back um Finn was is great he is great he is very honest he has great connections um and he has great integrity I wish I wish the community got to see a little more of that from him so Russ I really you know I love you but you gotta stop that man you are being a complete downer and it's not helping the community unfortunately I understand you guys are beyond frustrated um that's also another topic guys um not I mean it needs to be a whole nother topic we'll make an announcement but uh doxing people and sharing people's addresses from this point forward in case you're not aware will get you permanently banned from all fjb platforms um no matter who it is that is uh not okay I understand we play like the discord versus telegram thing and there's times discord says oh I defend telegram and telegram says I defend discord and vice versa um but I try I've tried to be as fair as I could I've you know uh do the voices I split them up um I understand it's kind of a fun rivalry but please keep that in mind and just try not to take it too far I know a lot of times it's in uh good fun but keep that in mind for new folks coming on um and what's in the best interest of the community egghead is absolutely correct on that are we launching soon how far off are we from completed a project I wish I could tell you um but I think this is the biggest step we've made in a very very very long time um I mean just the times we've been mentioned on war room period I think says enough and again I totally understand that oh well that didn't do anything to the charts but again with the way marketing works uh repetition repetition repetition I think we'll start it all up and uh even getting us on the war room social media for you know the people that may not have the time to watch the show or just watch a show here and there may have missed us uh or missed the you know quick mention of fjb um we are getting there I think this is the biggest step we've made in a very very long time again I did promise you that we are getting something scheduled um on a regular basis so we don't have this ongoing problem and uh we did that and I think um this is huge I think having us be featured um you know weekly and few times a week is is a very very big deal we're also very excited to uh start getting b&b's contacts sounds promising so in a nutshell everything formalized with b&b within a week uh in writing yes uh devs coming back on to fix app yep that we have the funds for that and then war room weekly shills imminent um absolutely as soon as we have that all in writing I will share all the details with you um also war room social media having regular fjb posts and posting the clips that way we can get out there and tell people how to buy and you know each I'm sure you all know how that works each one of those holders telling their friends um is what we're going for the more people start hearing fjb coin fjb coin that is the goal with the rebrand again it will be keeping fjb coin we just need to uh rebrand or focus on that freedom jobs business or completely rename that as far as the app just so we're not fjb at events and so we are actually allowed at events social media facebook also yes we have a facebook page what other integrations are to come for the app payment gateways etc as soon as we get a dev on we will get them on a voice and they'll do a much better job than me at explaining that uh to you all well we're still the fuck joe biden coin right um but like we discussed I want to say in the last voice um unfortunately we are getting denied left and right for being fjb understandably um even at these conservative events but what will we be uh I'm not sure I don't think that's been decided yet we kind of had more important things going on in the last few weeks
