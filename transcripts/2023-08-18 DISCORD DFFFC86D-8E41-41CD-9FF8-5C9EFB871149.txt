[Speaker 1]
Thank you, Rand. Make sure I'm recording. Awesome.

Happy Friday. So, figured I'd jump on here. Sorry, it's a little bit later than usual.

Completely my fault because I usually go to the gym right before and I sat there for an hour in the parking lot before I finally went in. So, a little delayed by the time I went and grabbed a coffee and dinner and got home. I actually did get home before 4.30 my time, but I wouldn't have had time to do everything else and sit down. So, I hope you've all had a great week. I know it started off a little crazy with the CoinGecko and Transact stuff, but I think everybody's squared away. We're squared away with that.

Everything is updated. The few meetings I had this week went very, very well. So, that's amazing.

We have a few more next week. One for just some updates with Transact. Another one for a third party that our task reveal depends on.

So, I will update you with that. Right now, they still haven't scheduled a date, but I'll let you know as soon as that's scheduled and then I'll let you know how that turns out. As far as XT, if you have any coins on there, please get those off.

Transfer them into your Trust Wallet or any other wallets you have. You will not be charged an 8% tax for moving those off XT. I know a lot of people were concerned about that, but please do so.

They don't have a hard date. That's what they're telling me and if you can't manually do it on there through their website, just go ahead and contact support. They should be more than happy to help you with that.

If you have any issues, please go ahead and send me your info and I'll get them to get that done for you. Just make sure to get your coins off XT the sooner the better. So, we'll do that.

Let's see. Same thing with Transact. You don't need to move funds obviously from there, but if you are having issues with Transact with your account being disabled, go ahead and send me a message with your Transact email and they'll go ahead and take care of you.

I think they already took care of the first batch earlier this week. I think we have one or two still working on that. I've turned in all the other emails I received this week.

So, go ahead and send me your email if your account is disabled. Make sure you do call your bank first because a lot of times the reason Transact is blocking it is actually they're not blocking it. It's your bank blocking it.

So, make sure you call your bank. There might be two different departments you talk to. One's going to be the fraud department.

The other one will be a different department that specifically they block you from buying crypto. So, make sure there's, I know for my bank, there's two different departments you actually have to. The first one just ensuring them that that's you making the transaction.

The second one to allow you to use your own money on crypto. So, I would make sure of that before you go ahead with the Transact. But either way, send me, feel free to send me your email if you're having issues with that.

The same goes if your buy isn't going through on Transact, please make sure you check your bank account first. A lot of times that payment is no longer pending and it's actually back in your bank account. So, make sure to check that too.

I've gotten questions regarding our social media or you know, people wanting us to go a little quicker on there. With the rebrand will be our social media will all be revamped. We just don't want to confuse too many people right now that are going to be wondering what the heck is going on.

So, once the task is released, then we'll go ahead and make the full switch over and start letting everybody know. But that way we're not confusing everybody that's following us on the socials. A lot of people follow us on there, but don't really come in the chats like you all do for all the updates.

That's that. Any other questions? As far as the task goes, we are still on track.

Again, we just have a major meeting this coming week and that'll determine for sure the timing on that, but so far we're still good to go. Yeah, I'll let you know if that changes as promised and definitely after the meeting we have next week. I don't think I got any questions actually in DMs. I did get back to most of my inbox. I still think I still have like a dozen messages to go through. But I've cleared those out. Will the meeting determine when the third party gets the go-ahead?

Yes, that is one of the key third parties. So it's a big deal because if they need more time, then we're going to need more time. Ultra Suede says you can check the status of Transact orders by logging into global.transact.com and clicking order history tells you if pending or failed. Thank you. Yeah, I think and don't get worried if your order takes a bit to fill. I know during the weekend I got quite a few messages of kind of concerned people.

So, you know and again, don't I mean feel free to DM me or tag me anytime, but just an FYI. It does take a little bit especially if Transact needs to refill because they do that manually, so at least at least right now. And as you know, they're in India, so sometimes it takes a little bit longer, but we spoke to them before about that and once volume, once our volume increases it's a little bit more steady.

They'll go ahead and get that automated for us. So that'll be super nice, too. I'm assuming everybody saw the new logo from last voice call on Tuesday.

It seems like most are liking it. A little bit nicer than the eagle head that was ripped off of someone. Telegram.

Telegram keeps archiving a lot of my ideas. Nope, doesn't look like I have anything there though.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you, Stacey. Have a good night. I'll keep you updated on the Transact account, too.

[Speaker 1]
Bye, have a good night. I'll call for his glory. I think we need her to do a few prayers for us.

She's back. Anything else before I get off here? Oh, I still haven't heard back.

I'm not sure if I imagined you guys aren't on here, but the person that was emailing me for support I didn't hear back of how everything went. I'm assuming I just answered everything and you got it figured out, but in case you're on here, please let me know. So that we'll make sure you're taken care of.

Sorry, just jumped on. Still looking good for August. Yes, so good so far.

I do have a meeting this coming week with the third party and that'll be a big factor, a major factor. So if they need more time, then we will need to push it and we'll need more time. Right now, that's definitely the biggest factor by far, but I'll keep you updated.

[Speaker 2]
Still August 18th. And we've got 31 days, so yeah, two weeks minus one day. Dev testing has been completed.

Team testing has not. We are waiting on Dev now.

[Speaker 1]
Just making a few little changes. Don't worry. They are not They should not take very long at all.

It's very, it's not, I should say it's changes to tiny little details. It's not changes of major functions or anything like that.

[Speaker 2]
Beautiful.

[Speaker 1]
Other than that, there we go, we got a prayer. She heard me. I thought all for his glory left.

Thank you. Questions before I head off. That seems like everything.

Please remember, don't, I don't recommend, highly do not recommend using the app to do anything right now or finding back ways to do things yourself. I don't recommend that at all. If you do get charged the 8% tax for accidentally selling or accidentally transferring your coins, we cannot reimburse that for any reason.

So just, I would just not mess with that. And also, of course, remember to not give your seed phrase or click on any weird links and don't send any of us money. Very likely if me or any of the other admins are asking you for money, or a seed phrase, or asking you to click a link, that it's not one of us and a scammer.

So just be careful, please. I know we had an unhappy user this weekend, but transfers do get taxed. So just be careful with that.

DM me or tag me if you have any other questions. And I will get this posted in case you all want to listen to it. Oh, I've gotten a question regarding Baby FJB.

I think I saw that in the chats a few times, too. We will update you with everything as soon. We've not forgotten about any of the details we've shared before.

So everything will come as we update. Also, I got some questions in, I think, Telegram. Of course, Russ asking about merch.

That'll be updated, too, as far as the website goes. Same goes for the roadmap. Same goes for the white paper.

Those both will be released very, very shortly after we go live. That being, again, that we edited those. I edited those many, many times as we kind of switched gears.

So it was just taking up too much time to keep changing. So we're just waiting until everything is absolutely finalized to make those changes. And I think you guys will love it.

So, I hope you guys have a great night. Have a safe night and a safe weekend. And again, I'll be on here if you need anything.

Feel free to DM or tag me. Thank you guys for letting me be a little bit late. Have a great night.
