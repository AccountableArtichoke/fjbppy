[Speaker 1]
All right, so I don't have any huge updates, minus we keep getting back feedback, different feedback from B&B, which is great news. As late as or as recent as this morning, they just want to know all the details and make sure, you know, just ask a lot of questions, which is good news, not only for the coin, but for all the holders and future holders. This is the most I've ever seen B&B be involved in everything, and it's amazing.

So Boris is in New York. Like I said, last heard from him this morning, got back to him right away with the questions or answers that he needed, so we anticipate probably hear back from him later tonight. Obviously, he's had a very long day, so we do appreciate your patience.

Again, kind of the downside of having somebody so big and prominent in our space, but I just want to hop on, answer any questions that you all have. Yeah, let me know. Can we see the full revised white paper?

We have the roadmap. Yes, and remember that is the proposed roadmaps. There might be little changes, and then the same with the white paper.

As soon as everything is a hundred percent approved, and then some of the changes, like the really big announcement needs to be made first, which again, should be, everything definitely should be this month, completed this month, unless there's something absolutely insane, but as soon as we get the go from B&B, yeah, I'm told. I'll just stop there. Sorry, I just don't want to give too much information, but we will have, so as soon as the first major announcement is made, is when we'll be able to release the white paper.

B&B have the revised white paper, just like they have the roadmap that you all saw, but we're not releasing it in case there needs to be any changes, and again, with a big announcement on there. When do you think the big reveal will happen? If everything goes as planned, it should be the first half of this month, but again, that's still really depending on B&B, because we can't get started until we get the full approval there, and have everything approved.

So, are the devs working on the app? No, because there's a lot of changes they need first, they need approved first, and then after that's done, then they can go ahead and continue with everything else on the app. Can we afford some new graphics on the final version of the roadmap?

Oh yeah, absolutely. Yes, yes, yes, and I think, I think there'll be a lot of new graphics. I think most people are wanting a new logo, but we'll see about that.

I think we can find a logo that better fits versus all the blue in our logo. I like it, but I don't know, maybe play around with the colors. Can we get Bannon to mention us again on War Room as I'm passing, like he's done in the last month?

Yes, absolutely. Of course, I think. So, regarding War Room, and regarding having B&B come on just to speak to the community, we, or B&B rather, just wanted to finalize everything before getting anything set in stone, as far as when they will be here to speak to you all.

But I'll keep you updated. Can you describe a bit about what version 3 of the app will have? Since that's still being finalized, I think let's wait on that, just because I don't want to tell you something.

Sorry, I guess my window's open in here. My husband must have opened the window in the guest room. So, back to my train of thought.

So yeah, so I just don't want to give you any information that doesn't, you know, if we don't end up getting that approved, but we should have that very soon, and I think it'll be, it'll be great. Continue making everything very, very simple. I know I've read a little bit in the chats this weekend, maybe even yesterday, of, you know, holders saying it's still, the app is still pretty difficult for a person who's a crypto novice or, you know, somebody who might be a little bit older, which I completely understand.

We want to make it so that somebody like your mom or dad or uncle can get on there who truly has, you know, very little knowledge of crypto or technology in general, and that they can do that. So that is the goal, and I have faith that we will get there within quarter two for sure. That's a huge, huge, huge priority.

I also saw like, oh, how come we started, you know, our goal was getting out to the, you know, the older generation, the war room, a lot of the war, you know, of course there's people our age, but there's a lot of war room viewers that are more mature, and now we're talking about college campuses. Well, we could do both, you know, there's nothing wrong with doing both and getting that huge demographic, especially right now when a lot of people, I feel like more than ever, are into politics because of the way, you know, the country and the world is going. So I did want to make that clear, make sure it's clarified for everybody that that is still a top priority.

That has not changed, you know, just because I said, oh, we do want to get out to colleges and, you know, pass out $5 crypto gift cards, FJB gift cards, that does not mean that we no longer want that more mature war room crowd. That is still very much the goal. Just kind of expanding our horizons.

Roadmap mentions reflections. Can you provide more details on how that will work? Yes, as soon, again, as soon as everything is finalized, I will definitely keep you guys updated.

I just don't want to share anything that's not finalized just because I don't want to, you know, I don't want people to say I was lying to you or hyping up anything or anything like that, but I think you guys will love it. The team we have working on this is a team that I very much trust and I think they are very, very knowledgeable, very level-headed and are determined to do what's the best for not just the coin and not just for the current community, but also for new holders, which in turn really just ends up being great for everybody. So I'm really, really proud of the team we have on board that is making the final decisions on all that.

Yeah. Can we fork to Bitcoin? Bannon hates finance.

Now would be the time. Yeah, so forking, like we've mentioned before, is definitely in the cards. We do want to make sure we can afford that to keep the exchanges.

You know, as we grow bigger, sure, we do have the app, but think about how many crypto holders we also will reach in the process that will go to XD or LBank or any of those exchanges that we're on. Gosh, what other ones are we on? Are we still ProBit and WhiteBit?

I know we got off one of those, I think. But that is definitely in the cards. I think that is something we'll definitely be doing in the future, is forking.

Was the roadmap surprise to be done in quarter two, quarter three, or quarter four? Do you just, do you mean the big announcement that was, I'm not sure what you're talking about, sorry. If you please clarify that.

Will Reflections be paid in FJB or something else? I believe Reflections will be paid in FJB, if that does not change from now. Currently, that's what the plan is.

Are Reflections a replacement for staking? They're not, I mean, we're going with Reflections versus staking, and I can get you more detailed answers on that, but our team did decide that Reflections would work in the best interest of holders, the coin, and new holders versus staking, and I can get you more details on that. But one of the many, many reasons, I very much trust the team we have in place, and I believe you guys will too, once you see everything.

How will old holders be benefited? I think they should be favored over newer holders. Well, I think older holders, you know, getting in early, I think a lot of people got in, are still getting in at great FJB price, and I imagine that will help because, you know, it's a percentage of what you hold, and the more you hold, I mean, like any other crypto, I think, right?

Whitebit is gone. Okay, that's what it is. I feel like it's been so long since we lost that listing.

Thank you. Oh, the big announcement. Okay, so the big announcement, quarter two for sure.

100% and the very, very beginning of quarter two. We are just waiting for BNB's approval. They did approve it a few weeks back, then came back after we turned in everything, and just wanted more information, which to me is great news because I've honestly never seen them be so involved, so I think that's great news.

Reflections is better than staking. Yes, absolutely. Farkas and Wolverine say staking usually requires coins to be locked up for a period.

Staking is security. Reflections works like a reward program. Yeah, and the crypto education will go ahead and include, I think, you know, we'll start at basic.

Very, very basic for somebody like my grandma, and then as time goes, we would love to continue the education portion of the website and the app, and I think everybody will benefit from that. Will version 3 of the app be built on top of the current app, or are we looking at pivoting to ready for market wallet app? No, it will be right now.

The plan is for it to be built on the current app, just to update through what we already have, which what we already have is great, but just some changes there. When do you expect marketing to kick in in earnest? Quarter 2?

I would say, yes, definitely. Right now, we're at the middle to end of quarter 2, depending on how fast we can get everything done once we get the approval. I'm very, very excited.

It's been a very difficult few days just waiting. I'm just ready and excited to start. Are BNBs revision significant or minor?

They are more legal based, just to make sure we protect ourselves, the coin, community, holders, everything. Sorry, I'm not sure if that answers your question. Legal, stupid.

You know, that's what happens when you have somebody like Boris as an owner, but it's, I think, for the best, right? Sucks to wait, but I know it's the right thing to do. Did you guys see A Kid Rocks?

I don't know if you posted it on others, but I saw it on Instagram. Where is it? Let me see it.

With the Bud Light stuff. Thankfully, I don't drink Bud Light anyway, but... Oh, somebody posted it in Discord.

Gotta go check it. To be honest, I haven't been in Discord for a few hours. I was on...

Oh, I do see it now. Oh, you posted it. Bob.

Bob. Bobby. Bobby.

That's how my parrot says Bob. Her old owner was Bob. Bob died.

So she always... I think I posted a video of it in Discord, actually, in like the... I don't know if we still have it, the pet channel.

Yeah, we do still have it. And then if you don't answer to Bob, she'll go Bobby, and if you don't answer that, she'll go Baby. All right, any other questions?

I didn't get any DMs of questions. Has work on the new website started? No.

We want to make sure everything is approved before we start on anything, minus the white paper and the roadmap. That's where a lot of the work has been going. But yeah, other than that, we are holding off.

Just to make sure. Anything to report on meeting with Transac? Oh, yes.

So Transac meeting went very, very well. I mean, okay, so let's start. Good news, bad news.

Let's start with the bad news. Well, not even... not really even bad, I should say.

But remember, they were trying to get the US off-ramp live for quarter one, correct? We were told that it's just taking a little bit longer than usual. Well, it's stuck.

So the off-ramp is stuck in... you guys are gonna hate me. It's stuck in...

this is Transac, though. This is not FJB. It's stuck in legal and compliance.

Now, they have no sort of timeline on it. They, to be honest, did not seem super confident about it. So I'm not sure if that's, you know, looking to be a lot more challenging than they thought, or if it's just going to take longer.

But I am told that they will keep us updated. Once it passes through legal and compliance, then they'll go ahead and get it out for their product team to push it through, right? So that's kind of the, you know, bad ish news.

I just want to do all to be, you know, aware of that. Keep that transparency going. Now, the good news is...

yep, you're right, Ed. The good news is we're not waiting on off-ramp, right? So that's great news.

But other great news is they're actually working on... so on the refills we had an issue with, and, you know, holders are having an issue with the times these refills take from Transac. Well, they're actually, I'm sure you all have noticed, lately they're refilling twice as much.

So they used to buy about 4 or 5k worth of FJB at a time. They doubled it to 10k. Now they're buying about 20k at a time, and they plan on continuing to do that for the time being.

Now they cannot automate the FJB buying process, even though they have about 96% of their coins automated. But what happens is you need to be on a major exchange like Binance for them to be able to do that. The great news is they are working on something like that, something like a DEX auto aggregator with, you know, right now they need to use that manual intervention with FJB.

But they are working on this, and they will have it automated by next quarter, or that is their goal. Again, for the time being, they are doubling their Transac buys. So that's great, and they are more than happy to work with us.

They were very, very kind, as usual, very helpful, and willing to continue to do whatever it takes to speed up the refill times. So please let me know if your buys are taking longer than expected, just so we can keep, I'll try to keep an eye on it in here. But please let me know if that is becoming an issue again.

I haven't seen many comments like that lately, so it seems to be better. But yeah, I think that's great, great news, and next quarter doesn't sound so bad. Wolverine says my last buy was the fastest ever.

Awesome, great. Yes, they are, they're very, very willing, and they did also say once our volume does increase, which we do anticipate on our volume increasing, that they would be able to do more. They'd be willing to do more, which we've discussed that before, you know, business is business.

It costs them to do business, and it costs them to make that automatic, completely automatic. So yeah, so I think that's great, great news from Transac, as usual. And they'll keep us updated on the off-ramp.

Again, I'm really not too worried about that, but you know. Have you restarted applying to events? We are waiting on the name change first.

Once the name change is finalized, we will go ahead and do that. Oh, We the People posted that video. Yeah, I hope that they see that in their sales.

I have no doubt. So yeah, as soon as our new app name is finalized, there's gonna be a lot of, I will be very, very busy. You said you thought first two weeks for big announcement, will that include the new name?

Yes, absolutely. Yes, yes, yes. At this point, I mean we could do the name as soon as it gets approved, or we can wait till the big announcement, either way.

But that way we can get everything started too, as far as website, merch, and everything else we can do in the time being while we wait for the big changes to take place. I made a decaf coffee. That's my drink of choice tonight.

Does the new app present any challenges to Google Play or iOS app stores? Nope, absolutely not. Should not.

Yeah, it will all just be improvements, nothing crazy. What's great about our app is that they can make all the changes through the web app, which is great. You don't have to push it through the Google Play Store or App Store.

I think Spesh was the one who did that. Do you have an idea of cost on all the big changes? Not completely, no, because there have been a few changes in the past few days.

How do you feel about Sam asking for a friend? Oh, Sam's amazing. Where is he?

He's not in here. I think Sam's the one I'm supposed to have babies with, right? Pretty sure.

Yes, I know all the names. I'm so bad with names. I know all the names next to the avatars.

And then I get confused between you guys' Discord and Telegram names. Some of you. Discord, because you change your names all the time.

I feel like you don't do that as often here, though. Yeah, I need FJB to go up so I can afford babies. All right, anything else?

With Reflections, a new contract. Can we dump BNB chain? So a fork is definitely in the plan eventually, but we do want to make sure that we can afford the exchange relisting fees, and those are kind of expensive.

But at that point, we have been in discussion about switching chains. I believe Optimism is one from several months ago. I don't know how you all feel about that, but I think that was one of the top contenders.

Sam is the eternal crypto cheerleader. Sam's so sweet. Win Moon, win Lambo, win baby.

That's all I want. Voodoo Child says, Mother Epper gets hyped when buying. Gets me hyped when buying.

I was laughing today because Stacy said she was draining the sack. It was so cute, though. Where was it?

Let me see. I forget what she said exactly, but it was so cute. So she goes, on that note, I'm gonna take a bite of the sack.

I thought it sounded a tad harsh when I was typing it and figured I'd just go with it anyway, lol. That was the cutest thing. Dallas says, Sam, she's ready, bro.

Oh, goodness. Win FJB meetup. I think events will be very, very fun.

I really can't wait for that. Just need to get this approved. Let's see, what time is it on the East Coast now?

8 o'clock. Start bugging Boris. What's the benefit of optimism over Binance?

So I honestly will have to look through my notes because that's been a while. I do know that optimism is very fast, very cheap. I remember that off the top of my head.

If somebody else in the chat wants to chime in, feel free to. But I know I do remember that. Binance, just because Bannon is not a huge fan of Binance, but I don't know, I feel like if you really look and dig deeper, Binance doesn't seem so awful.

But I'm sure you all know a lot more than I do on that. Stacey says, I'm not an event type of person, but I would love to meet this group. Yeah, me neither.

I think that's why we're all in here, just in our little basements. Pierre says, optimism gas is like a penny versus BNB is like 30 cents plus. Would LP move away from BNB?

I'm not sure about that and I do not want to give you the wrong information, but I imagine you would pull the LP from BNB. That is just an assumption, excuse me, from all the talk we've had though. I'm sure somebody will correct me if not.

[Speaker 2]
Bitcoin substitute? What do you mean?

[Speaker 1]
How long is LP going to be locked if fork is down the road? I think we will have to decide once we, I would say at least probably at least three months. I know in the past we have locked it for six months, so I would say between three and six months it would be my guess.

Oh, you're saying would we move LP to Bitcoin? I'm not sure about that. I have not heard that being discussed.

All the talk about Sam today and he's not here. LOL, star of the show. Don't know if this has been asked, just got in, but will reflections be paid in FJB?

That is currently the plan, yes. If that changes, which it may, I will let you know. All the Sam talk got Stacey hot and bothered.

Dallas. Oh my goodness. Guys.

Drinking tonight. Stacey, is your dad a holder? Wasn't he in the chats before?

I think he was. I think, I think I DM'd him at one point. I was trying to remember who it was the other day.

Sorry, Farkas. I'm going to mute you. Yep.

Holder. He's been in here before. Okay.

I thought so. Cause I think he DM'd me once like my daughter Stacey said something. He was so cute.

I know. I feel like I'm the only one without kids here. Soon.

He's 69 and not always sure what he's doing. Oh, that's so cute.

[Speaker 2]
Goodness.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Ronnie's love notes. I know. Does Ronnie come into telegram?

See some names like that I'm confused about.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if you guys have a, you know, Stacey's extra funny today.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Anything else? I'll definitely keep you guys updated.

Um, if I do hear back from, um, B&B tonight, I will make an announcement letting you know that everything was approved. Um, if it's tomorrow again, I'll do the same. Uh, yeah, that'd be super, super exciting.

Um, to get started on that. Sam, you guys are crazy tonight. I should've had a drink.

It's okay. I love Stacey. So on to the next one, I guess anybody else want babies?

Make that a portion of the app? FJB babies. All right.

Well, if there's no other questions, I will head out. Um, as always, please DM me if you have any questions or just tag me. Um, yeah, but that's all I have for now.

I will keep you updated. Uh, like I said, even if I hear back, uh, late from Boris tonight, it's already pretty late there right now, but, um, yeah, I'll just make a quick announcement letting you all know everything was approved. I will get the recording up right now before I forget.

Uh, and I will talk to you all soon. Have a great night.
