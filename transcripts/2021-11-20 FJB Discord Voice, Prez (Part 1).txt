So it was good I've been on the call this morning with a bunch of lawyers a bunch of people getting this thing all figured out all squared away Things are looking really good so far Wish I could give you some more clarity on that which I can give you some definite answers, but sometimes soon you will know What's that's the best part about this thing? So that's a great news. That's that's one number two You guys definitely saw the publication if you haven't seen it if you haven't tweeted it four times yet tweeted a fifth time The post-millennial had a great piece on us with a really beautiful headline Highlighting the fact that we've donated $50,000 in the past 28 days. 

That's how you get a hook. That's how you get people involved It's how you get people interested and it's a big shout out a big Thank you to all of you guys for doing that You guys are the other or the one person that's able to do you guys are the one group that's able to do that because There's no other community out there that's able to do this, which is unbelievable 50k.

So it said to rock who's it was a great part of this community's been here since the beginning so far We have raised fifty one thousand one hundred and fifty four FJB for whistleblower relief each one that comes forward is offered ten percent of the current total So that it continues to grow in value and never runs out word will get around Let's say you turn this country in the right direction expose corruption from the inside out He's like the movie inside job where the guy's robbing the bank from the inside. 

That's unbelievable So he is the man to rock. That's a big shout out. I wish we could do like the clapping in the background But to rock man, you know what because of that Want you to think about it today pick a donation pick a charity of your choice.
