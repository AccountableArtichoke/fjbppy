So I said, we'll push it back like 15 minutes, but it actually ended earlier than typical. So it was good. I've been on the call this morning with a bunch of lawyers, a bunch of people getting this thing all figured out all squared away.

Things are looking really good so far. Wish I could give you some more clarity on that, which I can give you some definite answers, but sometimes soon you will know what's that's the best part about this thing. So that's a great news.

That's that's 1 number 2. You guys definitely saw the publication. If you haven't seen it, if you haven't tweeted it 4 times yet, tweeted a 5th time.

The post millennial had a great piece on us with a really beautiful headline, highlighting the fact that we've donated $50,000 in the past 28 days. That's how you get a hook. That's how you get people involved.

That's how you get people interested. And it's a big shout out a big thank you to all of you guys for doing that. You guys are the one group that's able to do that because there's no other community out there that's able to do this, which is unbelievable.

$50,000. Yeah, $50,000. We donated.

Someone just said that. That's unbelievable. Someone said check out Turok's news.

I read that before. Let me see. Let me see.

Let me see. I screenshotted it. So it said Turok, who was a great part of this community, has been here since the beginning.

So far, we have raised $51,154 FJB for whistleblower relief. Each one that comes forward is offered 10% of the current total so that it continues to grow in value and never runs out. Word will get around.

That's how you turn this country in the right direction. Expose corruption from the inside out. He's like the movie Inside Job, where the guy's robbing the bank from the inside.

That's unbelievable. So he is the man. Turok, that's a big shout out.

I wish we could do like the clapping in the background, but Turok, man, you know what? Because of that, I want you to think about it today. Pick a donation.

Pick a charity of your choice. I'll donate $500 to it tonight because you're the man and you've been such a tremendous part. I'll donate $500 of my own money to a donation of your choice, a charity.

So you're the man. You're awesome. This is the weekly pick.

I'll do this once a week. I'll pick somebody in here, and I'll donate $500 to their charity. Last week, we donated to Alzheimer's.

It was beautiful. It was awesome. That was really awesome, really tremendous.

So we'll do that this week. So this week, Turok, think of a good one. Think of somebody that needs help, and we'll do that.

What else we got going on? We've been talking to some influencers. We're trying to make some progress on that.

We have those NFT, it's basically like Discord scraping, we call it. Going to NFT group chats, going to NFT TikToks, things of that sort. Try to pull those people in.

So that's still been going. That's still been going up. That's coming now.

Are we worried about being misquoted? I don't think there's any misquote. I don't think there's anything there.

But that's the good thing. But that piece was awesome. More publications are coming out.

And that's the thing that happens is it's a snowball effect. One person writes about you, then it keeps going forward. It keeps moving forward.

Article was a big step, Donald Pump, you're correct. It was one of those things that one person writes about you, starts a snowball effect, like I was saying. We're trying to get some things lined up with them as well.

We've been sending that publication out to a bunch of people, which is really incredible. I love that a lot. Probit, any information on Probit?

Probit has been absolutely frustrating. I posted that screenshot yesterday. I got into a verbal argument with the guy because he was just being a numbnuts.

And I was saying, hey, we need to post this thing because you said Wednesday, and then you said Thursday, and then you said Friday. And now your people are off on Friday. I didn't know you guys were taking off on Friday.

And that's the most annoying part. But we are waiting on an update. And then we got into an argument because you said he was lazy.

He's like, I'm not lazy. I sleep less than you. And I was like, okay, whatever.

We'll leave it at that. They're still going to be posting us. They're still going to be putting us up on the exchange.

I don't have a current update right now. But that's the annoying part. But we're going to get that.

I'm not worried about it at all. We're going to get that. It's going to be awesome.

Next thing, what else we got going on? We have WhiteBit. WhiteBit we're really excited about.

They have 2 million active traders, 2 million. You just need a VPN. It's so tremendously easy, which is awesome.

It's absolutely awesome. And we do donate worldwide. We donated to WCG 420.

I donated to the Alzheimer's of Canada, actually last weekend. So it is essentially worldwide. And this is just the start.

We plan on doing anything that's going to help people. So that's the greatest part about this. Everything has been awesome.

This community has been tremendous. The shilling has been fantastic. What else was I going to say?

WhiteBit. WhiteBit's coming. They give us the preliminary date of Thursday.

But as we know with exchanges, it's not on us. It's on them. We give them all the necessary paperwork.

They do the implementation. We wait for that. That's okay.

It's all right. We're going to be fine. So we're waiting on that.

Hopefully, fingers crossed that this Thursday would be awesome for Thanksgiving because we drop it on Thanksgiving and people are with their extended family they haven't seen in a while. They tell them about this coin. Boom, we double holders.

There's a whole lot of active trading going on WhiteBit and also with Probit, which is really great overseas in Asia, Switzerland, New Zealand. They have a lot of active users around the world. And this is a freedom movement around the world, which is really awesome.

What else we got going on today? We're sending out some emails to some PR places about that piece that Post Millennial dropped. Yeah, I have a lot of phone calls today.

I'm going to be talking all day long. It's Saturday, but we're not stopping. We're definitely not stopping.

And I want you guys to keep this thing up. It's a Saturday. The market might be a little quiet.

That's okay. Typically, we have like a Saturday morning sell off and we wake up and it's like war of the worlds, but haven't seen anything of that sort, which is awesome. We kind of got that out of the way on Thursday, I think.

But what I need you guys to do is just continue to get the word out. If you guys are somewhere this Saturday, you guys are at a brewery, you guys are at a bar, you guys are at a restaurant. Tell somebody new about this coin.

Tell somebody new about this community. Tell somebody new about the $50,000 donation. Tell somebody new about this thing because that's the way to do this.

We've grown organically since the start. Basically, all 6,300 plus people that are in this coin that are in this community, almost 4,000 followers on Instagram. We've grown that organically.

We haven't bought anybody. We haven't bought any followers. We haven't bought any members of this community, any members of the Telegram, any members of the Discord.

So hats off to you guys for being here and sticking around because this is day 29, day 30. Can somebody verify that? I'm getting my days mixed up.

But this is growing organically, which is incredible. And once we get one bit of gasoline put on this fire, it's going crazy. So I'll make it short and sweet today.

Keep shilling. Tell somebody new today on this Saturday about this. If you see somebody, if you're doing something, tell somebody new about this coin.

Let's keep this thing going. We're not stopping for anybody. We have huge news on the horizon.

I'm very excited to share with you guys. Just got to get that finalized. That's what I'm working on back here.

And let's keep going, man. Let's keep going. All right, everybody, have a great Saturday.

I will follow up later tonight, probably. So have a great one. Talk to you.
