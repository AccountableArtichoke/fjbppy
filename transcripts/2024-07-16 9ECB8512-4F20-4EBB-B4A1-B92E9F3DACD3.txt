How's it going? I feel like I'm doing this for the first time ever. Trying to make sure everything's good.

Alright. Awesome. Happy Tuesday.

I hope everybody had a good and safe weekend. Alright. How are you feeling?

Awesome. I'm so great. Thank you so much.

Um, yeah, I actually have been healing faster than I ever expected. Faster than everybody else. I'm looking at, like, in some groups and stuff.

I'm into online with, like, the same stuff that I'm dealing with. And I owe it to ketosis. And, of course, God.

So, yeah. Had a refeed yesterday and getting back into ketosis today. And everything's going wonderful.

Saw the doctor yesterday or the day before. He was actually in shock of how quickly I'm healing. So, everything's great.

I appreciate it. Freedom 2024 says can't hear. Hmm.

Closer to the mic. Let me see. Not sure I can get close.

Like, you know, I just have these usual headphones. Is that better? Maybe I'll try speaking louder.

Maybe check your settings on your telegram. That's weird. A lot of people are saying they can't hear.

Okay, hold on. Okay. Is this better?

That's weird. Trying to find if there's something I'm missing. No, my usual headphones.

Let me know if you can hear better now or if I need to grab a different set. Maybe my headphones, while they sat here not being used, something happened. Okay.

Weird. Sorry, I don't know if something was covering the little mic section, but let me know. And if that happens again, I can switch them out.

Okay. So, the devs are doing great. We're done testing our admin section from our side on the app.

We're also done testing the classified sections for you all. We just have a little tweaks. They're working on just four security reasons.

And I don't mean security reasons, of course, as far as your coins or wallets. But this is more the political target and the trolls we kind of get. Something very minor.

Basically, when you all put a classified add-up, it has to be approved by an admin. Right now, the way it is, you can edit it after you post it. And it's just editing it and letting that edit go through without an approve.

So, devs are just working on that to make sure we fix that. So, it either needs to get approved or just make you delete and repost the post instead of being able to edit it. Because I'm sure, as you all know, we are very popular.

We have a lot of people who love us and a lot of people who love to hate us. So, very awesome. It looks amazing.

It looks phenomenal. Very excited for this. Of course, there will be a minimum.

As you all know, the price that we set to make it all easier for you all right now is in dollar amount. We will also add an amount that shows you the PPY amount. But of course, there will be a minimum there just because, as you all know, there is a minimum to transfer.

As the value of PPY increases, of course, that amount may or may not fluctuate. We'll update you on that. And of course, we work with our partners as they continue also adding different features and options.

Of course, we'll continue to adjust. But it looks really cool. And this way, you all can list items that you can actually sell to other patriots and ship to.

A lot more features going on there as we grow. We also plan to add basically just more layers of protection for all you guys, including an escrow kind of feature. That way, you know, nobody gets scammed.

You pay for an item, say you don't receive it, you know, your coins are gone. So a lot of room for growth there, which will be really, really exciting to update as we continue to grow. Other than that, let's see our app users.

The number of app users we've had has officially tripled since before we started our social media marketing. This is wonderful news. This week, we will have an email going out to all these users now to specifically push buying PPY.

As you all know, if you've seen the ads on social media, you've seen that we've had our influencers push for everybody to get on, to try the app, to create an account. And we have had really awesome, really, I mean, more than we expected, especially with just the introduction response. So very happy with that.

Definitely better than we expected. And of course, we continue to, we will continue to build off of that. Our two influencers this week will also continue marketing again.

And again, we will push out an email to all users, which you all will receive if you have signed up for the app. Let's see, what else? Give me just a second, actually.

Got a dev going on. Not received. I do need to catch up on DMs from you.

From what I saw in the previews, I think I have replied to all the high, high priority ones. That means you all needing help with, you know, or issues with the app, transactions, anything like that. Please forgive me as I take a little bit more time to get to everything else.

When will we start showing up to all the Trump rallies? That's being discussed, obviously, due to current events. I don't hear anything.

Sorry, I'm not sure why the sound is being weird today. Not doing anything differently. How many more influencers are lined up for this current?

We have several more influencers. We will be pushing more. We'll continue with these two influencers while we start marketing buys first to stress the app before we continue to add any more influencers.

We're getting plenty of traffic this way. Just got to see how the transactions volume starts once we start marketing that. When can we purchase coffee and other products?

Also, are we going to be able to post things up for sale like Facebook Marketplace or any approved vendors? The coffee and dog treats are what we're waiting on right now. We expect to have both of those listed by the end of the month.

We are just waiting on the vendors to get everything to us. The other items we have so far, like the Shark Tank product from the owners that have been on Shark Tank, that will be posted by the end of the month. I lost my train of thought.

We've had a great turnout from other vendors this week. We'll see how soon they can get us their items to make sure we can test them. Make sure that the quality check passes of items that we want in our marketplace.

Quality to have available to you all. As long as they're ready, depending on how fast they can ship us their products, we can get them on again by the end of the month. As far as you all posting things in the marketplace, it'll be exactly like a Facebook Marketplace or an OfferUp or anything like that.

Your posts will just need to get approved. There will be two sections now when you go to Marketplace. There will be a business section and a classified section.

The business section will be from approved vendors and the classified sections will be from other users. We will just have to get those approved. Or rather, you'll have to get your listing approved.

Just don't post anything stupid. Talkmon says he'll go to another Trump rally. Me too.

I'm thinking he'll make it back to Phoenix at least a few more times if it's anything like last election cycle. I'd also like to go anywhere that's not hot and not really, really cold. I'd like to make it out to Florida.

I wonder where we have like... It'd be interesting to see where geographically we are as far as PatriotPay users. But yes, I would personally love to attend a few more.

The Marketplace will start selling stuff by the end of the month. We're just waiting on vendors at this point. Are we working on the direct listing of PPY in this app?

Yes. We're actually just waiting on a legal detail there. As soon as that's approved, it should be less than five days is what we're given.

But it's an important piece of the puzzle. The OfferUp Marketplace type section is already complete. We're just fixing a little detail there.

Sorry, you probably didn't hear that or weren't on the beginning of the call. But a little detail right now is when you all get a post approved, you can go back and edit it. And it doesn't make you go through the approval process again.

We need to change that because there are trolls. So we want to stay compliant and we also want to keep you all safe and happy. So just Deps are working on editing that.

It should be a pretty easy, quick fix. Will all transaction and classifiers be with PPY tokens? Yes, absolutely.

So it'll say, here I'll screenshot you guys my version of the app. So the price it'll tell you is in dollar, just so you all have a better idea. You don't have to calculate versus PPY, but you'll be paying a PPY.

And then you'll also be able to message the poster too. We'll give you guys an option to add your own post. Show you like this and like this.

A little sneak peek for you. That's the desktop version, obviously. So when you go to add, it'll actually...

It'll automatically enter your wallet address. Then you'll just have to put in your image, name, description, and price of the item. So go around your house and see where you're going to start.

Posting up for sale. Does anybody live somewhere where there's really cool succulents? I guess I'd buy those.

A succulent collector. So if you live somewhere that has really cool ones, or you just have them outside, lucky. I'd be willing to buy those.

That's my current obsession. To use Marketplace. Yay!

Yeah, it's really cool. For Marketplace, you will need to use Expert Wallet. And that's only because...

And of course, with Expert Wallet, you're going to have to have somatic rate for gas. And this is because the way the chat system works between the wallets. So again, as other companies add on different features, of course we'll be able to build on that too.

And continue evolving. But for now, your listings will be in Expert Wallet. Because of that.

And we'll add, we'll make sure to add little notes and stuff too. If you don't follow the chats or new users that are trying to use it. Potential seller, what would I need in Expert Wallet to get started?

You don't need anything. You just would need your Expert Wallet. If somebody is going in to pay for it, it's going to automatically take you to Expert Wallet.

So if you try to pay and you don't actually have funds in Expert Wallet, it's going to tell you that you need to add funds. And take you to add PPY funds. But the reason this is, is just because of the system we use for the wallet-to-wallet chat.

Which is really cool. Because then you can message other users through their wallet address.

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Will your address be saved in an aftermarket place in Classify? I'm not really sure how to answer that. I'm trying to say, will our app wallet get funded when people buy?

Yes. So if you post something for sale in the marketplace, somebody buys your item, that transfer PPY is going to go to your Expert Wallet. And you'll have PPY in there.

You message them, they message you, get their address, get their P.O. Box, however, and send them their item. I guess unless it's an item you can virtually send to. Or a service.

Maybe you sell a service. Maybe you're a web designer. You don't even need to leave your basement.

To make more PPY. Okay. Could you make it so that it's only saved on our side of the app and hidden from you guys, nothing against you guys?

The wallet address? I mean we can, but it's going to be on the blockchain, so there's not really a way to escape that. Sorry.

How come the buys on the app don't show up on Deckscreener? I've bought several times on the app and I don't see the buys anywhere. This is because your buys are going through change now.

So that's a third party who refills their wallet and then sends the PPY to you. So you can see it through transfers. But you won't see it as a buy.

A lot of times. Sometimes if change now is out and they need to refill, then you'll see their buy too. Our physical?

Yes, we don't see your wallet-to-wallet messages. That's why we use the system we used. If you all only see each other's messages and you only see each other's wallet numbers, we might be changing the details of that as far as how the wallet address shows up in your inbox.

But yeah, it's a pretty cool feature. It's really awesome. Our devs are amazing.

And our advisors are amazing. They worked together on that and I think it's really cool. So all the new people coming in from advertising won't show when they're making buys?

You'll see it again if you look at the transfers on Decks. You'll see those buys and you'll also see when change now refills. So what happens is change now has a pool of PBY.

Say they buy $1,000 worth of PBY. As soon as that runs out, they'll be refilling their pool of PBY. So the more users we have buying, the more transfers change now will be making to those users and the more buys that change now will be making.

So you'll see it more as larger batches of buys to fill that pool to pay out those people buying. That's the way change now has it set up right now. That's the quickest way we can make that happen.

We are also working on integrating other ways into the app. I will update you on that as soon as that's finalized and once devs are working on it. How is the traffic from the advertising?

Our number of users in the app has more than tripled as of today since we started the influencer marketing. So that is great. What we'll be doing next is sending out an email that you all will receive too, more so focusing on the buying of PBY.

Really cool. Really, really awesome. Anything else?

We still have a few stragglers emailing that have not imported their PBY in their app. So if you know anybody that had FJB in their trust wallet, feel free to send them over so I can walk them through that. I thought we'd gotten the last of those, but it seems like there's still a few more that came out this last week.

Again, this is if they had... Oh my gosh. Ah!

Hold on. Oh my gosh. Where did that come from?

There's a freaking spider on my desk. Some kind of spider. Okay.

Gosh, I lost my train of thought. Okay, if you know anybody that had their FJB coins in a decentralized wallet, so this does not count if your coins were XT or LBank or the Vest app and you don't have your seed freeze. But if you have it in Metamask or Trust Wallet or your Expert Wallet in your app with your seed freeze, please have them reach out to me so I can get them the information to import their PBY so they can see that in their wallet and they can enjoy it and maybe use it for transactions.

Sorry, Mike. There is no way, unless you want me to run out of the room and just leave the voice chat. You have to go.

And my plants are all inside for the summer, but I didn't think there was any bugs. I mean, they've been inside for a while now. So I don't know where this little one popped up from.

House spiders. Yeah, I don't know what kind of spider that was. It was small and it was pretty meaty.

Like white and black spotted. No clue. The white spotted jumping spider.

Is that really it? No, that can't be it. Oh, it looks like that.

No, it wasn't like that. I don't know. I did it ASAP so I didn't pay too much attention to what it looked like.

Okay. Anything else? Is there more advertising coming this week?

Yes, we'll have our influencers do another push and then we'll also send out an email ourselves to get PBY. So we can, so far, like I said, we've tripled, more than tripled our app user count. But we've got to get those buys or at least really any transactions tested with a little bit more volume.

So we'll have that email go out this week. Sooner than later. And then we'll have our influencers do a push more towards the end of the week as usual.

Any idea on how to encourage buys? Like match buys for the first one up to a certain amount. Oh, like are you talking dog bone?

Like buy 10,000 PBY, get 10,000 free. If that's what you're talking about. We're actually working on a few different like third party services to figure out the best bet for that.

The trouble with that is just the unfortunately the abuse that comes with that. So that's been the biggest hurdle there as far as any kind of promos we want to do. You know, whether it's sign up and get $5 of PBY worth of PBY or whether it's, you know, buy 20 bucks, get five free, anything like that.

Just unfortunately opens the door for scammers. That's been our biggest hurdle in trying to find a third party to integrate into that. So as a follow up, the price may go up in the app, but it won't push the coin up on quote sites since it isn't going through the DEX screener.

So yes and no. So change now. Right now I think their pool last time I checked was like anywhere between $1,000 and $2,000 that they hold, right?

So yes, correct. If we have like a few $20 buys right now and change now, just refilled. They have a pool full of $1,000.

Then you will not see price increase most likely because those are just going to be transferred from the change now pool to those few buyers. But what ends up happening is you will see the price when change now refills again. So that explains it.

And with volume, that won't really be an issue. I mean, it hasn't opened at this point, but I totally get where you're coming from. Will the marketing email also mention the option of donating to Trump's campaign using PQI?

Yes, absolutely. And then actually we have our donation promo will be included in that email where our percentage of our donations will be going to for the next short period of time here. I'm hoping we can help out the victim of the unfortunate event that took place this last week.

So I'll get you guys the details as soon as we have that finalized. Hopefully we can do what we can to help there. I think there's no better cause right now.

Awesome, cool. Yeah, let me and feel free to DM me too if you have any questions, any other questions regarding that mark. But on the decks, you'll be able to see the transfers.

We can also add the transfers with the we did with the previous bot. I'm not sure if this bot does it too. So I'll check on that too.

As volume increases, we might be able to add transfer alerts in the chat too. So you all can see those. Anything else?

Well, that seems like everything. If you all think of anything else, please feel free to reach out. I plan on getting to my DMs by the end of the night.

I'll also try to get to paying out all the contests. I think we're a few behind now. And then we'll do a contest for this week.

What kind of contest do you guys want? Or do you want one? Let me know and we can do that.

No, I am not at the convention, unfortunately. I would love to be there, but the timing worked really well to get surgery. I've been waiting for a while for what I really needed to do.

Unfortunately, I am home, but I can't wait to attend. It would have been perfect because it would be nice to get out of the heat right now when it's the hottest time in Phoenix right now. But it's also nice just being at home and recovering.

Oh, thank you. I appreciate it. No, we have not sent out refunds yet for that.

That is on my to-do list. I have not forgotten about that. To go through you all's transactions and make all your PPY refunds.

I do appreciate your patience with that and the contest payouts. I'm good on the lowdown. I'm not sure when I can be out and about again.

I'm doing everything I can back into ketosis today. I'm feeling a lot better than I thought I would be. Even the doctor has ever seen.

That's great news. I'm just trying to not stress too much so I can do most of the healing right now at the very beginning to be able to move forward. Thank you all.

I appreciate it. Thanks. Dogbone and Linda and Mark and everybody.

Thank you all for all your patience. I appreciate it. We will get caught up.

I will get caught up on everything here. Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime. Please remember again to not share your information with anybody.

If anybody comes in the chat that has a profile that looks like mine or that looks like another admin is asking you to send money. Know that I will never ask you for money. No other admins will.

They always catch you on a bad day obviously. Don't ever fall for that. They're always very frantic and I need help right now.

I will never do that. No other admins will do that. Please be very careful and be very careful connecting your wallet to anything.

The app is nice because there's not really a way for you to connect your wallet from the Patriot Pay app to some other sites. But definitely be careful because I know a lot of you have your wallets also in TrustWallet or Metamask or any other third-party decentralized apps you have out there. Just be very very careful of that please.

The code that you get emailed for your app logins, that is pretty much like your seed phrase in a sense. If somebody does ask you for that, don't ever share it. If you do share it with somebody, it shouldn't really allow them to log in.

But you never know, you just don't want to risk that and don't want you to get unhappy with that. So just keep saying, make sure to keep your funds secure. Again, I know a lot of you are learning crypto and it's very exciting.

So you want to explore other crypto coins out there and stuff like that. But if I wanted to do that, I would just make a completely different wallet and connect with that wallet that doesn't have your PPY in there just to be extra extra safe. That's what I would do.

Again, just make another wallet that you connect to other sites you want to learn or try out other different kinds of crypto coins with. If you do that, it's not worth losing your coins. I know it's been a few weeks now since we've had somebody from the community lose their coins, but it's always very unfortunate.

And I'm sorry, but when it happens, there's really not much we can do. So just please, please, please be on the lookout for that and don't ever share your information. If you're ever in doubt, just ask in the chat.

Ask in the general chat. Again, I know usually if you're having that bad of a day, you're not thinking things through. They always catch you when you're having a bad day or when you're sick or something like that.

But just to be safe than sorry, just always double check in the chat. And somebody is usually around to help out. So thank you all so much.

I'm going to go cook my steak, top it with a bunch of mayo I just made earlier. Actually, Stacey gave me an idea. I ended up making mayo, mixing it with guac.

I'm going to top my steak with that. I'm very excited. Probably also have some fish that I seasoned.

So I'll do that and then I'll get back here. If you guys want a contest, let me know and we'll get one started. Otherwise, I will plan on seeing you back here Friday, and I'm sure before then.

You all have a wonderful night. I will post a recording as soon as I'm done with dinner here. I'm just starving.

Thank you guys.
