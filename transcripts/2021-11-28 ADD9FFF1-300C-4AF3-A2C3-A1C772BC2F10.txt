(0:00 - 22:48)
I don't know my headset is right now and I'm a headset guy. Hey get back down there music Try to get try to sneak sort of pull a fast one on me Yes, you hear me. All right. 

All right. Nice cuz I don't have is it like clear or is it like blurry? Is it cloudy? What is it? Good. Good. 

Good. All right unreal what's going on everybody. How are we tonight? How's our as our Sunday going? I know the WFT did not play today. 

So it was a good day because they didn't lose but they're playing tomorrow We've got some Seahawks fans in here. So maybe we'll do a little friendly donation wager going on tomorrow with the WFT But what's going on? How's everybody doing? Hopefully you guys had a good weekend In regard work. Yeah, we're you're working. 

We're all working. This is a 24-7 type of gig and We're not we're not stopping we are not stopping I told myself that I would take a rest day when this thing gets its legs and there's been no rest day yet And there will not be a rest day until this thing yet gets it going gets it rolling Because we're not stopping but I'll let you guys know. I don't I don't need one. 

I don't like to rest I like to fucking work. We're gonna keep this thing moving. We're gonna keep this thing going to the fucking moon Exactly. 

Exactly Donald pump. That's a great point And be a whole lot of rest days a whole lot of rest days, but We just pull this up pulling in telegram. Do-do-do the whole thing with telegram and discord Telegram is such a different crowd than discord. 

I have no idea why but it's such a different crowd and Oh speaking of that so this week coming up I actually so I have LASIK surgery on Thursday So I'll probably be inactive. I haven't got the LASIK done yet I've had a bunch of appointments because of the dilate and the dilation was all screwed up and I messaged a couple weeks ago About it, but I haven't gotten it yet I had to get postponed for a couple different things and then now I'm finally getting it on Thursday So that's that's locked in as of right now I've canceled them on them twice for things with a coin So I think they'll kind of get pissy with me if I cancel for a third time, so I'm not canceling it I don't think I'm gonna cancel again. So I'm getting the LASIK this Thursday. 

I'm getting that I don't know what time exactly it's that I have it in my calendar somewhere but I'll be so I'll be inactive for like a couple hours with that and then I think that my vision is gonna be alright and I can 100% do a voice session that Thursday night 100% but I think I'm getting laser beams in in my eyes I think I'm going to get Like I'm gonna be like Cyclops. So that's gonna be a good thing. I'm excited for that But as everybody in here gotten LASIK, what's the what's the typical turnaround time like? Let's see if anybody posts in here because I feel like we have a big way of a hundred If some people in here LASIK is a great call a couple hours. 

Perfect. Yeah, I've heard a couple hours I've heard some people had some adverse reactions in terms of like a lot of swelling and stuff The doctor might the doctor that was talking to was like, oh you can't go to the gym for like four to five days And I think you're on crack. I had I had shoulder surgery Last January I tore my labrum so I got it done and I went to the gym the next day with my sling on and I was walking on the Treadmill and they kicked me out of the gym because I was like like stumbling on the treadmill But make sure you loop up your eyes and I think I got all crusty I hope that it's it doesn't get all get all crusty. 

But uh Yeah, I think I'll be good. I think I'll be good for like the night I'll probably after the surgery just because I just wanted to let you guys know if you guys are wondering where I'm at on Thursday I gotta figure out what time it is You can get it. I'm 23 You can get it whenever it does. 

I don't think there's there's a There's an age limit for it. But um, I hope my eyelids don't stick to my eyes, but I'm excited Well, but yeah my Thursday we're gonna have a this week's gonna be tremendous. This week's gonna be fucking sick I'm not worried about it at all There's gonna be this is going to be the most exciting week yet 100,000% of the coin this is day 35 see I'm getting mixed I need to start I'm gonna all my in my office I have like a wall right in front of me and it kind of like goes on a diagonal I'm gonna throw a big thing right up there and say day whatever and just keep adding keep adding keep adding But 100% is going to be the most exciting most exciting week. 

I read tend to take her I think you put Vaseline over your eyes before bed. Even if you don't have surgery, I think you just do it for fun but um This person's answering nice. Sorry for the late response Okay, I've been waiting for XT XT is being a pace. 

So I think XT is 13 hours ahead Yeah, so, okay Let us know so we've been like working with them in this morning And then they kind of ghosted us because we had to set up some accounts for them and stuff like that But we'll probably be working through the night trying to make sure that everything on XT is all set Because they've even tweeted it. They've said everything you know what I mean about XT. So that's the balls in their court That's that's reason number one of the reasons why this week is gonna be so tremendous because if you guys forgot XT is live tomorrow a United States trading platform like we've mentioned before like Billions of dollars being traded on there. 

It's going to make this so much easier and I honestly think that we probably have over Like a thousand people in the bullpen like you know what I mean? Like when I say it has people in the bullpen, I mean that people that want to buy they're just not allowed to But Not allowed to but they just don't know how to is what I mean But once we get on XT, it's gonna open this bitch up so much so much so much so much So so F go you can use KYC that just makes it so you can I think deposit right into there But you also don't need KYC you can you can buy Bitcoin on Coinbase and then send the coinbase Bitcoin to your XT and trade it from there What else we got doo-doo-doo Didn't see if you answered earlier any word on coin gecko coin geckos be a pain in the ass We've reapplied twice now still nothing. I hope it's I hope so all your birthday tomorrow money on my mind Happy birthday. Happy early birthday but Yeah, we've yeah Barley's corrected. 

There's been some there's been some a little a tad bit of political pushback I would probably say one exchange that really give us any issue The thing is money talks and money's green. You know what I mean? So they don't give a fuck once this thing starts really taking off I guarantee all those exchanges that were on the fence about us are gonna come back around say oh we need them So I don't I don't understand why that They wouldn't want us because we are going to be one of if not the most Popular coins Q coin is something that we're working on Q coin is like our in my vision Is like our Super Bowl It's like our pinnacle of where we're going to go to because Q coin is tremendous as a top-five exchange. It's Chinese own They won't give a fuck because I would love to be on Coinbase Obviously you would love to like anybody would love to be in Coinbase You'd love to be on crypto comm like the big ones crackin and stuff like that But with a politically charged like United States thing this there's so many like restrictions and stuff like that So that's why I think that coin gecko is being a pain in the ass first I know there's another let's go Brandon thing, but our ticker is FJB So I think that's kind of where they get us but Q coin is going to we're working with Q coin currently Yes, and we've applied to them Working on them really trying really trying our best That's gonna that's gonna be our big sir boy, and it's gonna come up a lot a lot a lot quicker Face they said that we need an exchange, but we got probe it One of the reason why we got progress because it's supposed to be the easiest and then Esmond kind of throws for a little hurl As means a little bitch, but we're on we're on probe it right now again like I said Probe it was one of those things where we're like hey, we're scrambling to get on exchange Let's get on one we got on probe it or it's like one of the first ones we applied to there So I don't really quickly I also understand it's not us so that takes out a big part of our demographic however, there is a huge freedom movement that's going on around the world, so We kind of want to be first of the party like I said wipe it wipe it is Thursday Not Thursday the 30th whenever the 30th is oh shit Ready this Tuesday. 

Holy fuck. That's what they said in the last time they were on chat, but they have like some strange like weekend type of thing where They don't work on the weekends and that's kind of crazy to me into the crypto world because things are so fast paced and We've like we were messaging them on Friday, and then they were like oh actually We will get back to you on Monday, and I was like can and I even messes them yes, I messes them yesterday I'll see if I can find it right here. I Wipe that I messes them. 

I said looking forward to the update. I messes them at yesterday at 252 p.m.. They said hey as we mentioned above we'll update you on Monday. Enjoy your weekend with a smiley face Like screw off I'm not gonna enjoy my weekend until this thing is flying until this thing is having fun until we're all donating money and having a whole tremendous time But um other than that man. 

It's things are going really well on our end. We're working very hard We're doing a bunch of different things. There's a lot of things in the works most importantly What are you so what are you gonna? See tomorrow this weekend was a little bit quiet We did a really good job of coming back today because as always we have that little weekend dip as is drew in here Drew so you up here if he's not in here. 

I'll be upset. He's always in here, but um Yeah, we've applied to coin market cap yet. We have to update their pain in the ass I'm gonna really start pressuring them once we get on this thing Exactly the Saturday sell-off it either happens early in the morning or late at night I'm convinced that the algo is caught on to the early morning sell-off, and they started pulling it late at night Drew can be in here. 

He's been here every Saturday. He can attest to it, but it happened It is what it is. We're crawling right back up there We're about to test and make our old support that we slightly broke now it in terms of TA terms It becomes a slight resistance, but once we get back above that and that's a strong support again You know I mean, so if you're looking at it like that again Monday's a new business day like abuela says hundred hundred hundred hundred thousand percent true We had a great comeback today great overall comeback that's on you guys that's on you guys for doing that and Speaking of that I'm making a click to tweet because I think we haven't had one of those in a little bit of time I'll send that right over after this after I get off this and tonight wait where is um First as NFT That's what we need. 

We need doesn't have to it does NFT is let me let me pull them up. Where's he at? They're gonna push our tech members. Okay, cool. 

Yeah. Yeah retweet that tweet the one that bandages posted yet That is something I posted in the announcements. We really got to show that thing Des is our is gonna be our our shill master. 

He's gonna be the shill coordinator the shill master So I just I just added him I I'm gonna I want him to coordinate and really get on us about some more shills We have a big Sunday shill night Really letting the world know about XT because a lot of people know about XT even if you're like a slight crypto person XT is a really easy and useful way because it's in the app store And when it's in the apps where you can automatically see it and trade it right on your phone And it's very intuitive the charts are very easy Everything looks great Um, so what XT is awesome awesome awesome Like I said before if you haven't gotten your accounts squared away square where your account very easy very easy Regardless you can just buy it on Coinbase Coinbase a friggin 90 year old grandpa can you buy Bitcoin on you literally just connect your bank You send it like a hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin and then you just send that over to XT and you swap for Bitcoin To FJB, which is so so so so so easy so easy so exciting We're gonna get a shit ton of new eyes on there, and I am so excited for that I couldn't I couldn't be happier other than that like you said we've been working on this on this news for a long time I wouldn't say a long time. This is probably like day. Maybe 11 or 12. 

Yeah, maybe maybe like 12 to 14 XT yeah, I'm gonna look at that package again bandit They said we pull up the email actually I'll send you I'll send you the criteria Criteria of what they said when we first got that thing one moment. Not them. Here we go This is the listing agreement. 

I'll pull it up. I Wonder if it would be in here. I remember the first package that they posted That's not the word document that I was looking for. 

I was looking for this for a document to do to Let's pull this bad boy up. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah Blah-blah-blah blah-blah-blah Do you want to get on there the blah-blah-blah the payment blah-blah-blah the party party party party party with the lack of traction blah-blah-blah Applicants declaration they're gonna sign it as the confidentiality and then where the freak did they post their little Spiel they like we're selling us. 

You know what I mean I'll find that though. I'll find it I don't want to pick up your time and say like is it this lady was oh wait This is the listing proposal. This might be it There's there's more than three million three million users on X day available in the United States, which is tremendous Very active there is around it says there are trading volume around 100 billion USD T Every day is what it is what it says I can send you a screenshot of what they're saying What we can do for you is they can market in the blockchain community with PR AMA events Build your own community do to do we already built our own community and really the fucking best community. 

So fuck them with that Whereas this is the roadmap, I guess that they send us. Yeah, they did it. They did the whole nine yards They did the listing discussion the information form billing. 

We did that agreement signing did that market making did that? Integration group setting did that smart contract audit did that deposit testing did that listing announcement? They just did that and then now next last but not least is the listing Very very very exciting So I couldn't be I couldn't be more juiced up about tomorrow.
