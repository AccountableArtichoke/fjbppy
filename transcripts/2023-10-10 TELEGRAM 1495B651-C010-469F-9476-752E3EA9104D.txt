[Speaker 1]
All right, cool, that's on. I hope you guys had a great weekend. Mine was pretty full and hot, it's hot as heck back here, and then I got my butt kicked to church, so it's a holiday season, so that's nice, makes everything go by quicker.

Review is still going very well. The reviewers and our original dev are working together to figure out a few things as of this morning, so that's great news. We are still moving forward, everything's still going as expected, no change in timeline as of now.

That does not mean that timeline won't change in the future, but so far, so good. Other than that, tonight we'll be ordering the merch and the banner for the in-person booths, so that'll be awesome. We're just ordering one of each to just make sure everything is as expected, and then as soon as we get those in, should be two business days, so definitely by the end of the week, then we'll order everything that we need for the in-person events, so very excited for that.

Most of them are live on the Shopify store, which has now moved. If you go to the old one, it'll still forward you to PatriotPay, but that's patriotpay.myshopify.com. You can just get on it from the website, so that'll be great because as soon as we have that, we'll for sure get going with events, so that'll be great.

Again, should be completed by the end of the week, unless should meant for whatever reason goes longer than two days, but it should be averages at 1.8 days, so that's good news there. Our app devs are still working on that. The failed transactions have not been fixed yet.

I will keep you updated as soon as those are fixed. That is still the number one priority and what the devs are working on. I think that's everything.

Let's see. Boris, when did we last? I think last we spoke was last week.

I do need to contact him tonight regarding a few things, so yeah, everything's good. I don't think I received any questions in DMs. Let me know if you have any questions. In the meantime, please move your coins off of XT.

If you or anybody else you know has coins on XT, please transfer those out. Do that ASAP. I know they haven't given us a hard deadline, but better be safe than sorry.

Please get your coins off of XT. If you need any help, feel free to email, DM, or tag me so we can get you taken care of. Let's see.

Hi, Sarah. It's been one month since you advised us that the devs were now working on fixing the app with priority to failed transactions. Yes.

Given the number of devs working on the app, can you update us as to the progress? They are still working on that. Unfortunately, with transactions just failing, the info they get is only so much.

It's also hard when they are not the devs that originally built everything, so that's why that's taken longer than expected. But the good news is, and I mean initially, we knew, we were hoping that it would be, I guess, comparable to what failed transactions in the past, but it has not been. We were hoping it would be like it has been in the past, where it just has taken a dev one to two days to figure out failed transactions, but that's not been the case.

So, I will update you as soon as they figure that out. That is still the, of course, the number one priority on, as far as the app goes. Israel or Palestine?

Oh, that's, it's so sad. It's so sad, because, I mean, you guys know how it is. It's the politicians are the only ones winning, and innocent lives are being destroyed.

Super, super sad. I've actually been like, oh, I've been so affected by that, and I hate it. I hate, like, I feel like sometimes ignorance is bliss, and I just sometimes wish I didn't know as much as we all know now, because it really does make me so sad.

Okay. Will the app be finished this month? There is no way for us to know that.

The devs don't even know that. As soon as they have a closer idea of when the app will be completed, I will let you know, but that's kind of hard when you have something like failed transactions that, you know, there's not really, they don't have a time, because they have no idea what the issue is. Have you been over there before?

No, I've been to, I've been to most of the Middle East, but I have not been to that area. I think the closest to there is Jordan and Syria, and Lebanon. Lebanon was amazing.

I hate Jordan. Been there several times. I hate Syria.

I'm just not a fan of those two areas. Not a fan of anything there, really. Nothing.

There's not a lot of places I could say that about, but yeah, Jordan and Syria are probably, actually, my two, probably my two least favorite places I've ever been. No desire to ever go back, and it's sucky, because I've been there, well, I think Syria only twice, but Jordan several times. So, hopefully, I'm good if I don't ever go to either of those ever again.

Yeah, very, very sad, and sad just to see everything being said, and the crazy things people being, to me, it just seems like you either, like, I don't know, I guess I like to give benefit the doubt. So, to me, when I read the things that some people are saying, it's like, okay, you have to not have any idea of what truly is going on, because, I don't know, I refuse to believe that you could be that evil to say the things you're saying. So, maybe it's just like ignorance, like it has to be, but who knows.

Let's hope. Just super, super sad. What else?

I did just check the email a little bit ago. I don't think I received anything in there. We are still working on the Apple Store issue.

[Speaker 2]
Somebody emailed me from the Shopify store. Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
See, last month, our transact volume was right over a grand. Hopefully, that will be going up shortly. Hope to see an increase there.

Wow, five, it was five of you. It was five of you last month who did all the buying on Transact. It's probably Russ, Russ from his five accounts.

Are you still expecting the third party to commence their work straight after the reviews is complete? Yes. Yes, absolutely.

That's still the case. If that changes, I will let you know. Will the third party still need the 10 days as previously advised?

Yes, that has not changed. If that does change, you'll be the first to know from me, for sure. Yeah, everything as far as timelines we've gotten from the reviewers, from third parties, has not changed.

The app, failed transactions, hasn't gone as quickly as we'd hoped, but we never really officially got a timeline for that. Sorry if you guys hear my parrot sounding like a retro phone ring. She's been very hyper today.

The devs working on the failed transactions, are they full time? Yes. Yes, they are.

Not on the weekends, though. Weekdays. Is the task reveal likely to be in October?

So far, we're looking at the tail end of October. But again, that's hoping that everything goes as expected, because that's really at the tail tail end of October. So if the devs need just a few more days, that would put us over.

But I'm hoping that even getting out to events will kind of, you know, help liven things up a little bit since that, until that's completed. Or that app, at least, at least failed transactions and app is functioning as expected, or as intended. I think that would help, too.

With transact volume being so low, are they aware of the situation going live with a task? Is there any way they drop us last minute, like wire? No, so far, so good with them.

Yeah, they're very aware of us rebranding and a few things we're doing with our app and everything like that. But they'll, they'll be made aware of the new changes. As soon as those as soon as everything's live.

No, the worse comes to worse with transact as again, this can change. Right. But as everything we've agreed to so far with them is if our volume does stay really, really low, we would just have to pay a monthly fee, which we would prefer not to.

So but they've been they've been great. I think they've been very understanding with everything we've gone through. Definitely a great company.

The two reviewers, are they reviewing different parts of the task? No. And this is two different entities.

So each one has several reviewers. One will be reviewing everything. Now, we'll make the changes we need to make that the devs already working with them on and then we'll have a second the second reviewer.

So instead of having them both review at the same time, which kind of be a waste because likely they'd find a lot of the same things. That way we have one review, make any changes, modifications we need to change, and then have the second one reviewed. So this way we just have a better chance of catching anything.

There was something the review found that needs work on. Yes, the dev is already working with the reviewers. As of this morning, I believe yesterday morning, we had a meeting and then we have a meeting tomorrow morning.

And it's like carbonated water, but it's so carbonated. Ginger peach. The team won't have the team won't have to remove part of the task, will they?

No, not so far. Just making some minor edits so far. Knocking on wood.

Because we, the dev was really awesome and made sure to fit in pretty much everything which is why it took a lot longer. Lots of loopholes.

[Speaker 2]
Anything on Discord?

[Speaker 1]
Actually, what am I going to do? I'm going to remove my Discord app on my phone and see if that solves anything. If the devs are working full-time on the app issues and have been for a month or so and they are not making progress, what is their plan?

They are making progress. They've just not figured out what's causing the failed transactions. Because the devs didn't build the app and we don't really have anything in writing on how everything works in the background, I know it seems very simple on the front end.

It's a lot more complicated than I can even pretend to understand on the back end, but that all is taking the devs a ton of time. They are progressing because they have to, you know, like I mentioned before, they're having to understand how everything, every little detail works and try different things. Oh, no, that's not it.

Oh, no, that's not it. Keep moving forward. So their plan is to keep working and they'll eventually find it, I hope.

Otherwise, we're in big trouble. But no, yeah, I definitely have faith that they will find out what the issue is. Gosh, my telegram is still acting so weird.

Show me something and I'll click on it. Still shows my messages. Is somebody else writing them?

What the heck? Where's Nolan?

[Speaker 2]
Nolan's not here tonight.

[Speaker 1]
He's been chatty in general chat. Okay, so yeah, to recap, I will let you know if any of the timelines change as far as the devs, third parties, anybody goes. So far, so good.

I will also let you know as far as the app goes as soon as the devs do find the reason that those transactions are failing. I should know more after tomorrow's meeting too, so hopefully we'll see if they've made some progress there. Then again, ordering the banner and everything for the in-person would be awesome if we can get those started by the end of the month for sure, just to get things going and start getting their name out there.

And that will also help kind of get us just start warming up as far as events goes before we can kick off gift cards and actually sell those cards, so that'll be nice. I think that's everything. Oh, we did start reaching out to more folks this week.

I believe at the end of last week too. Just people we want to partner with too. So I will keep you updated on the progress of that.

The reviewers, are they confident they will have finished by the end of next week? So that will depend. They started working on everything with the dev this morning, so that will very likely depend on how that goes with getting our original dev to...

They're going to work together to make some changes, so depending on how that goes, I will keep you updated. So far that has not changed the timeline, but I will let you know if it does. We're hoping that's not the case.

Knocking on wood. When will the Apple Store issue be solved? I was thinking that was a quick, easy fix.

Yes, all it is is a certificate, just a few logistics. Just a few logistics as far as our account and signing in goes and stuff like that with a change of ownership. But yes, that's a very...

The only reason our app got removed from the App Store is a certificate expired. All you have to do for that certificate is pay the $100, and that's literally all. The only reason our app is not in the App Store yet is, again, just some logistics.

It has nothing to do with the app being removed or anything wrong with the app other than that expired certificate, and all we have to do for that certificate is pay in the App Store. 1,000%. I'm gonna make an alt when that happens.

I have to have an alt ready. Who does that? Donnie's like the king of alts.

Him or Sherlock, maybe. I'll get on Etsy and get an alt for afterwalt. Okay, that's who it was, Donnie.

I thought it was one of them, one of the smart ones. Oh, I thought you were answering me. Oh, boy.

Yeah, I think that's everything. I hope you guys are living somewhere cooler because it's way too hot here. We've got like a week of cooler weather I was so excited about, and now the dogs are dying during their walks again, so that's not fun.

So, one of you forwarded me this like, I don't know. I don't want to say coupon group because it's not a coupon group because the stuff they post is mostly pretty expensive. Some of it is junk, but stuff you'd buy is pretty expensive, and I need to mute it.

I forget who forwarded it to me. I need to mute it because I'm going to spend way too much money on this, plus it's super annoying. How do I do this?

Let's mute. Oh, mute until. How about forever?

Oh, it doesn't let you do forever. What? Oh, there.

Mute forever. Cool. I forget which one of you sent me that.

All right, anything else? MP is not typing, and neither is Ed, so if you want the fizziest soda water, you need to get this. Wow, it's almost too fizzy for me.

All right, I think that's everything. I don't see anybody typing. Again, please get your coins off XT, or if you know anybody that has coins on there, please get their coins transferred off there.

If you need any help, email, DM, or tag me. You won't be charged the 8% for transferring your coins off there, so don't worry about that. They do charge a very small fee.

I think last time I checked, it was like 8,000 coins, so please contact me so I can get you taken care of, but please do get your coins off XT. Again, we will make sure we email everybody that we have, if we do have your email, but trying to give everybody plenty of notice because although they haven't given us a hard deadline, we don't want you to lose your coins, but you do need to do that sooner than later because we are trying to get our team coins off there too, so please, please, please do that ASAP. There's quite a few of you who still have coins on there.

I've received the Excel sheet from them, so I know I'm not just talking to nobody. I know several of you have a good amount of coins on there still, so if you know anybody that maybe doesn't frequent the chats in here, please let them know just in case they went and bought some coins on there, but other than that, obviously don't share your seed phrase, click on any weird links, or reply to any DMs from any admins or anybody else asking you for money. It's likely a scam.

I think that's everything. I will let you guys know if I have any updates after tomorrow morning's meeting. We don't really have a time.

They like to just message me. We use WhatsApp, and they just like to message me like, are you available now? If I'm walking the dogs, it's like, yeah, give me an hour, so probably be around 8am my time or so.

I'll update you if I have any updates, and we'll go from there. I will also update you as soon as I get those shirts in. Hopefully everything, the hats and shirts and stickers and everything, looks as good as it does online.

That way we can either make the quick edits or, again, just order the book to have those for the events. If you are somewhere here in the Valley, contact me too. We can use your help, and we'd pay you.

You guys have a wonderful night. Feel free to email, DM, or tag me if you have any questions or need anything else. I will see you in the chats, and then I'll go ahead and give me a few minutes to convert this and write some notes, and I'll post it in the chats in case anybody needs it.

Thank you!
