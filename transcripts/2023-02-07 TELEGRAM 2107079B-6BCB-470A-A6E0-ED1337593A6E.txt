[Speaker 1]
Recorder up, but I just remembered now. When will LP be locked? Again, just waiting on B&B.

Literally it. Could you update balance after paid bills? I'm not, oh you mean like what that balance would be?

I don't have that on hand right now, but I can get that out for you because we should be up to date, minus I need to get reimbursed for what I've been paying, which is around 5k. Last time I checked, I am not sure if that includes the other, the last final payment for the gift cards, which was $2,000. I don't remember off the top of my head if that 5,000, give or take, included the final payment for that.

Are we pulling away from FJB? I heard rumor of a name change. Yes, possibly because we cannot seem to get approved for anything.

As far as events, we've had a really, really difficult time with that and we don't ever get a reason. So we're, you know, I was just always like, thank you so much. We're sorry, but you know, we can't choose everyone.

So yes, a more so, I'm not sure if that's going to be an entire new name or just really veering away from that FJB just so we are allowed to be at events. And still, I mean, I think at this point FJB is kind of on its way out anyway, but more so like pro everything we are versus the FJB. And I think that'll definitely help us get into patriotic events and everything else that conservatives love.

Are you in communication with Boris and Bannon? Boris mainly. Yeah, I haven't spoken to Bannon in a bit, but yes, with Boris.

Yeah, I know it's not, it's not like fun and I get like, oh, our whole thing is FJB, but I do think that we can, you know, kind of morph into something long term. I think it'll be good for us ultimately, but it's no fun, you know, to keep getting denied and not getting a reason, even from super patriotic events and vendors. But it's understood because, you know, they have, I'm sure they have their own contract tracks and they have their own vendors.

And so yeah, Marissa's market marketability. And that's exactly it. Let me see if I got any questions on Discord.

I don't think so. Can we get some input from the community for rebranding? Maybe a vote?

Yeah, absolutely. I know there's a few ideas floating around. And let me see if I can find them to share.

But please don't go after me. And these are just, let me see. Let me find those for you.

So these were ideas thrown out. We the people. And yes, yes, I get, I know what some of you might be thinking.

So we the people, revolution, freedom coin. I think I'm just going through a text thread. I think that was it.

America's most badass fucking crypto coin ever. If we were rebrand, would we fork to version four? Honestly, I'm not sure about that.

I'm not sure how that would work out at this point. But we will keep you updated as soon as there's solid kind of ideas for that. But yeah, a new chart would be nice.

Would be nice to, what, where are we at? Let me see. Excuse me.

Not too shabby. Where's BNB at? Let's see.

BNB had a nice spike. Shoot. We must have had some sellers or what?

Is the FJB in marketing wallet for sale? I'm not sure. I'm not sure right now.

But we will, I can update you or DM me. Just because with all the like changes happening. Yeah.

This star isn't being recorded. Yes. Although I didn't record until a few minutes in when I was reminded.

I'm sorry. But I think we repeated everything since I started recording. So you should be good.

But as always, let me know if you have any questions. Are Boris and Bannon ready for LOND? Can we please leave Grants Gay?

Let's go random BS. Yeah, that would be nice. That'd be actually very nice too.

Yeah, there's a lot of ideas floating around for, you know, a new rebrand, so to say. And as soon as, yeah, as soon as I can share, I will definitely share everything I can. Yeah, I think it'll be good to finally, finally keep moving.

I know we've been kind of stagnant for a little bit. And I'm just as frustrated as you are, trust me. The good news is, our marketing funds, it's amazing when you know, they're actually being used the way they're supposed to.

And even with our super low volume, we're actually, you know, building that up very nicely. And I think that is a great start to keep building on the app and make it at least functional. Transact, so for the last month, we got, we just got our Transact monthly performance report.

We had a little bit over $3,000 US dollars in successful orders. That's not terrible for, you know, how little volume we've had. Hmm, what is it we're waiting on?

We're just waiting on legal at this point. We've had, we've actually, gosh, it's been a few weeks. We brand the token swap to a secret FGB.

Yeah, I don't know. About all the decentralized blockchain media company. Not sure what, to be honest, I'm not sure what that was even about.

I don't know if anybody here remembers. Has Stephen K. Bannon seen the mail carton?

I'm not sure. Has anybody shared it with him on Getter? I saw he retweeted some of our stuff.

Did the legal meeting happen? Yes. We're waiting on another.

Jan said he's sent or he's blasted that mail carton. So he, I imagine he's seen it. Oh, that's funny.

Sorry, I don't know why I feel like I'm under the weather. Gee, drink more of my water. Is there an LP lock update?

Just waiting on BNB. Is deplorable coin available? Oh, probably.

Let's see. At least, I've never heard of it. Wait.

Maybe there is one already. Deplorable coin. Looks like there actually was one, but I'm not sure if that was a crypto coin.

Last they posted was 2019. Beautifully crafted out of fake gold. Oh boy.

Interesting. Steve Bannon actually comes up. He talked about creating deplorable coin.

What? This is the first I've heard of this. Baby Bannon coin.

I had a dev on the Transact dev site confirm to me they would have the off ramp operational in Q1. Have you had a similar, have you had similar updates? Um, I have not.

I know Zelle is non-operational. They sent me that this morning. But I've not gotten that update.

To be fair, we never got a personal update saying it was moved either. We saw that, I believe, on a public post. So, they've not updated us either way from when they initially said it would be ready end of quarter one.

FJB chain powered by deplorable coin. Yeah, a lot of good ideas. Something, you know, you can actually, I feel like a name that you can actually, well, one, to get people's attention, but two, to be actually used between businesses.

I think that'd be really cool. And still be cool to put on merch and stuff like that. Change now.

Have you heard back about where the fees are going? Actually, I have not. Um, I imagine, you know what?

Let's, uh, come back to me. Let's ask in the actual chat. See if anybody gets to us right now.

And yeah, so Transact did send, it was a 400 and some odd dollars, almost $500. And from now on, they said, yeah, once this reaches that threshold, that's when they ask what wallet we want to transfer to. JB says, we need a name that hits more of the conservative base, not just us.

Absolutely. Ross is going to go check on the chickens. I'm jealous.

I want chickens. Are Bannon and Boris putting time into FJB? Um, it's been a bit since I've talked to Bannon, but Boris, I talked to him as recent as Friday night, I believe.

Very late Friday night. Has there been any progress with missing funds investigation? It's now been over four months.

Um, yes, I will update you as soon as we can update with that as soon as I'm allowed to make updates from the attorneys. How did the meeting go with the gift card devs? Awesome.

Their piece is completely, uh, finished and it's all completed. Everything's good. Um, we're literally waiting on legal, safe of the world coin.

Will LP decisions be made this month? Um, if it were up to me, yes, but unfortunately I do not make the calls around here. I am just the messenger.

Oh, somebody actually got back to me. Uh, we'll change it out. He is checking with the team.

Maybe we'll hear back while we're on the call, huh? Send lawyers, guns, and money. Name that artist.

I stood outside the restaurant he's saying about very fucked up, but happy. From what you're hearing, is there appetite to get the LP locked? Yeah, absolutely.

The, the issue, um, so the issue about locking the LP guys is not, it's not the issue of whether they want to lock the LP or not, or whether they want to run away with the LP. Um, I think everybody knows at this point, both Bannon and Boris's wallets are locked. Um, in the meantime, um, it's just, if we need to fork or if we need to do anything really, um, we can't do that.

Anything that they're thinking about, we can't do that if the LP is already locked. So that's literally the only reason the LP is not locked. It's not because a B and B want to run off with the LP.

Um, so I hope that's clear. I do believe that. Um, I am very confident in saying that, um, uh, there's probably nothing else I'm more confident about right now than that.

That is, that's very solid cut and dry. Um, I would not be worrying about anybody pulling the LP, um, by any means that is, I think the last, last, last of our worries. Um, and the decision around the LP again, not being locked is just because there are a ton of other decisions being made.

And if we lock the LP, then none of those decisions are going to be possible with the locked LP, which would have us wait another however long till the LP unlocks to make the decisions that need to be made. Um, so I hope, I hope that helps a little bit. Um, but again, I can say that with all confidence, um, that is truly the only reason the LP has not been locked.

Um, but I do understand, obviously, um, I do understand everybody's concerns, uh, about the LP being unlocked. I do hope that helps a little bit though. It sounds like big changes in the works.

Yes, absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
What's not clear is the direction of the project. Excuse me. What's not clear is the direction the project is taking.

Yes, I will have an update as soon as I'm allowed to have an update for you all. I wish I had more for you now. That's kind of why I didn't want to do a voice on Friday either.

Um, but I just came on to, uh, let you know and make sure that I promise I am here. It's not that I'm trying to walk away by any means or trying to disappear. I just really have no update as of now, uh, to share, but yes, I totally understand that.

Mm hmm. And I hate that anything with legal takes so, so long. At this point, I am ready as ever to move on, get going.

If there is a name change and forks are going to be announcement from B&B. Um, I'm not sure how they want to do that. I will be honest with you before I would say two, three, four months ago, I would have said, uh, yes, but, um, yeah, I'm not sure how they'd want to go about that.

I know Boris is, uh, in particular is a very particular, so. Oh, change now just responded for clarification. Let's see.

We might get an answer from change now, right now. Is Steve Canavan going, getting tats? Is Bannon getting tats just in case he goes to the brink?

I'm not sure that would be funny. Maybe he could get an FJB tat. Maybe he can get one like wag.

Oh, oh my goodness. I still have the March trip coming. So I really hope everything with legal plays out like it needs to, because yeah, that would be nice to, um, get something FJB or, you know, coin related, I should say.

Um, in March, that'd be really cool. I'm like, I'm ready to start events like yesterday, last month, last year. So, uh, yeah, hope this goes quicker than it has been.

Hoping we at least, uh, start moving at a faster, uh, rate. Hmm. Logo contest when and if name changed.

Oh, that'd be cool. Good idea. Be nice to have like a community, more of a community run community vote.

It is kind of strange. We have the blue logo, huh? Hmm.

Ross says we know who'd win that. Well, well, well, not me. Literally the least artsy person.

I did make lemon meringue pie today. It's really good. I think it's going to be really good.

Laser focused coin. Hmm. All these names.

Be interesting if, uh, we do a name change on what ideas you all would have. Where has, uh, where's Universal Fun? Has he been in?

I haven't seen him. I've just been seeing, uh, comments about him. So I don't know if he's showing up in like side chats or what.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Is there a name change being planned? Possibly. Either way, we're moving away from the FJB abbreviation.

Um, I think we discussed that last week, maybe in case you missed it, but we're getting denied left and right for really any kind of listing, which is, uh, getting very frustrating. And, uh, we don't ever get a reason we've literally not gotten one reason. So starting to think it's the FJB.

So that's why, uh, even if we don't change the name, we'll definitely be dropping the FJB versus Freedom Jobs Business. But that makes it hard. I mean, I guess, unless you want to go with like FJBC.

Um, so yeah, it's, uh, an idea. Patriot coin. Simple.

Let Steve name the coin, give him some options like deplorable coin, Patriot coin, freedom coin. 1776 coin. Freedom coin.

Freedom coin is like pretty, pretty solid. I think cross every country, you know, exactly like you hear freedom coin. What else do you think?

Right? Is there already a freedom coin? Looks like there is or was at one point.

I feel like any name you think of there was, well, it looks like there is. Is it really? Is there a freedom coin?

Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
Interesting.

[Speaker 1]
Is this a real coin? Does anybody know anything about this? Let's see.

It looks like there is already a freedom coin. So maybe that one's out. Hmm.

The copper money of crypto. Okay, so maybe not freedom coin, but something else. Hmm.

I like liberty coin, but is there already a liberty coin too? I feel like there's an everything coin or there was at one point, kind of like we the people rug pull. Did we ever find out who was behind that?

Supposedly it was a guy who claimed he was a vet. That was an FGB holder, but I don't think we ever pinned down who actually was. How about Bitcoin?

Is that taken yet? I don't know. You got to check.

I have no idea. Never heard of it. Hmm.

I can't believe. Wait, I'm going to look that up again. I can't believe takedown the CCP is no longer on Spotify.

What the heck is that all about? Can anybody else play this song on Spotify? Is it just my phone?

If we are to reset our expectations, what can we expect over the coming months? I would hate to promise anything because I don't have much say in final decisions. However, I really hope that I think from what I've heard from legal, I think we're we should be expecting to move forward fairly relatively soon, hoping within the next month.

Yeah, that's pretty much all I got right now. Sorry, I wish I had more to share. But as soon as I can, we will just get on voice right away and share everything, not even schedule it because I'm I am ready to share what we can share with you as soon as we have an update, if that makes sense.

Sorry, I just I wish I had more to tell you right now.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, exactly. The like a global name, especially there's a lot of people. We have a lot of holders that are actually outside of the US.

The right coin, the people's coin, the right coin. I don't even know when that's supposed to be decided on, to be honest. Let me see.

[Speaker 2]
I can't find anything on it.

[Speaker 1]
ABC coin. What? I don't get it.

He's looking for representation. What? Wow, change now.

Actually, I'm very responsive. I found somebody online. So we'll see.

Trying to get into our find out who has our affiliate account. And their minimum to like threshold is like more like 46, 47 dollars right now. Well, it's based on Bitcoin, so so that'll be nice if we get a nice chunk from that, too.

Every little bit is kind of helping. Oh, how are you doing? Good.

Awesome. I actually have family in town from Chicago. So, yeah, I've been spending some quality time with family.

It's been very, very nice. Very, very nice. Oh, goodness.

You guys. The most creative. Okay, let's see.

Let's see if we can get our little change now bucks. Okay, so we'll see what we can do with change now. But I'll definitely keep you guys updated.

You know what they say? Guests are like fish after three days. I don't know.

What did they say? I'm assuming they start to smell. I don't know if they're like fish.

I don't know. I love having people over. Well, I love having family over, I should say.

Family that I like.

[Speaker 2]
Wow.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Any other questions? I'm going to see my aunts for the last time before they leave tomorrow.

I made some key lime pie. I got to make the whipped cream for that and decorate it. I squeezed, I was squeezing key lime pies all morning.

You know how many tiny key lime pies it takes to make a freaking pie? A ton. Hello?

Hello? That's weird. All right.

Sorry about that. Who ended that chat? Heath, was that you?

I'm kidding. I just want to tease you since you did that last time. Somebody ended the chat.

Anyway, how's little Sam? Oh, he's so, he's, he's awesome. But his, like, foster parents are out of town.

So he's, he's extra cuddly. I hope my little recorder is still going. Yeah, it is.

I'm just messing with you, Heath, only because you did it that one time. All right. Any other questions?

I'm seeing my aunts tonight before they head back to Chicago. I got to make the whipped cream to the key lime pie I made this morning. So that'll be fun.

Then I got to decorate it, get ready, and then head over there. So it should be good night. I will definitely keep you updated.

As soon as I have an update, we'll set up a, I guess, a call, probably, honestly. What the? What the heck?

What is happening? Yeah, I don't know. Either somebody keeps kicking me out or, or something.

Anyway, are there any other questions before I head off? Somebody said, Brandon. Yeah, that's weird.

It's like a few times in a row, too. Awesome. Well, that's all I have.

As always, DM me. But I will make sure to get on and update everybody as soon as I have an update, as soon as I can share with everybody some updates. Do you see a balloon?

Right above my house. Actually, that'd be fun. Get pew-pews out.

It's me. I got in my truck. Sorry.

What? Maybe Russ is the one that kicked me out. All righty.

Well, cool. If there's no other questions, then I will head out. I'll make sure to get the recording up right now before I get off so I don't forget.

Russ says it could be. Sorry about that. Sam says it's the libs or universal fun.

I keep hearing so much about universal fun, but I haven't seen him. Is he, is he like still? Is he still here?

Is he still in the side chats? Is that what we're all? Or are we just kind of not forgetting him, kind of like Finn?

Or is there a reason we're not forgetting him? He's still on coin market cap? My gosh.

What a bad look. Why would you do that if you still hold coins? The strangest thing to me.

I'm going to get on and trash talk my own, my own investment. It's just a little weird. A little.

All right, y'all. Well, I'll get the recording up. Thank you as always for your patience.

Um, I think we are finally getting close to having some updates from B&B. Um, so I think that'll be, it'll be good for us to, uh, move a little quicker. Um, but yeah, as always, let me know or the admins know if you have any questions.

Um, and then we'll plan on a Friday voice. If we have any updates before that, we will schedule another voice and that way I can share with you what I can. You all have a wonderful night.

I'll see you in the chat.
