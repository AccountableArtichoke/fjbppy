Music Here's a little song I wrote, you might want to sing it note for note. Don't worry, be happy In every life we have some trouble But when you worry you make it double Don't worry, be happy Don't worry, be happy now Don't worry, be happy Ain't got no place to lay your head Somebody came and took your bed Don't worry, be happy The landlord say your rent is late He may have to litigate Don't worry, be happy Look at me, I'm happy Don't worry, be happy I give you my phone number, when you worry call me, I need you happy Don't worry, be happy Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style Ain't got no gal to make you smile But don't worry, be happy Cause when you worry your face will frown And that will bring everybody down So don't worry, be happy Don't worry, be happy now Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy Put a smile on your face Don't bring everybody down like this Don't worry, it will soon pass whatever it is Don't worry, be happy
