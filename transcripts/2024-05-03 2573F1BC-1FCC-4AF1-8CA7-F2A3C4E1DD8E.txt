(0:00 - 0:16)
If you have DM'd me on Telegram and I haven't responded, it's because I have my privileges taken away. So make sure you add me as a contact and then try to DM me again. And I will reply back, but very slowly, so that doesn't happen again.

(0:17 - 0:35)
Telegram is reviewing my account, but again, I'm not sure how long that'll take, if that'll be hours or days or weeks, but I will keep you updated. Otherwise, contact me on Discord, but I also don't want the same thing to happen there. I do have my Dev Chats and stuff, so I don't want to lose privileges there.

(0:36 - 0:49)
But if you add me as a contact through Telegram and then DM me, I will slowly get back to your DMs. Apparently I was DMing you all too fast. Also feel free to email.

(0:50 - 1:04)
Several of you have been emailing recently. Okay, let's review. Your FJB is lost, it's gone, it got replaced with PPY, period.

(1:05 - 1:18)
Your FJB got replaced, your FJB coins that you had in your wallet got replaced with PPY. That's what we owe you, that's what we paid you out, we paid you out the same amount. End of story there, that's how the fork works.

(1:20 - 1:30)
So I hope that makes sense. If you have any questions about that, feel free to contact me, but we are not sending anybody any FJB. That's it, it's gone.

(1:31 - 1:52)
You know, if it was in your smart wallet, if it was in, it's gone, you've got PPY instead. So add the PPY, look up the videos on our YouTube channel, on the Rumble channel, in the Discord and Telegram, in the how-to, and add your PPY to your wallet. Your FJB got replaced with your PPY.

(1:52 - 1:59)
We are not sending you FJB. That's it, it's done, it's gone. That's how the fork works.

(1:59 - 2:12)
You don't get both. So I hope that makes sense, but again, reach out if you have any questions. I feel like recently the emails have been all about that.

(2:14 - 2:28)
Okay, oh, I see a few of you with the DMs coming in again, so I will, it's not that I didn't receive your DMs. I will, so you don't have to send all your DMs. I have them, I just, it literally won't let me respond if I'm not a contact of yours.

(2:29 - 2:47)
So just, you know, you don't have to reply with everything you sent before. Just send me anything so I can go back to your DM, and then I will slowly get back to all your DMs until Telegram fixes my account. All right, moving to the app.

(2:48 - 3:08)
Devs are still working. Well, actually, our smart contract modification is complete, that's being reviewed today. That was complete as of last night, so that's great because as soon as we, we actually have another modification that's been completed to add to the smart wallet.

(3:09 - 3:44)
We're gonna add that modification probably within the next week here, and that smart wallet modification to the contract, and then we will have the ability to go ahead and sell the team tokens without having to sell the entire balance. We'll also be able to transfer out of it, which is awesome because that means we can keep some PPY. We don't have to swap it all into a stable coin or Matic, and then we can pay people through those two.

(3:44 - 4:09)
So that's great. Our dev who's, wow, that's really loud, hold on. Our dev who's working on the security aspect is doing a pretty good job.

(4:09 - 4:37)
I think he's been putting in like 12 hours a day. So he signed off for the night, and he will be back Sunday to continue work there, and I'll keep you guys updated as far as that goes. Other, I know some of you messaged with another company, The Patriot Pay that started business a few months ago.

(4:37 - 5:09)
We're very well aware of that. They've been very nice and cooperative. They have changed their name officially, and yeah, our attorney is reviewing everything to make sure it's everything we needed them to change, but everything should be updated, and I'll keep you updated on that as soon as our attorney approves everything, but they have their new name.

(5:09 - 5:21)
It's all on social media and all that. Again, I've been aware of that for several weeks, and we have been pursuing it. So that's been great.

(5:21 - 5:42)
I'm sure that'll happen. I have no doubt that'll happen again, but we've made the name public for close to a year now actually, and we have a trademark pending. So again, I'm sure that won't be the first or last time, and I'm sure people will do it excellently too.

(5:43 - 5:55)
So no worries there. Oh, a lot of talks with businesses to get into Marketplace. Hence, I posted that survey for you guys.

(5:55 - 6:24)
We'll probably have a few more of those just to gauge interest, and again, for starters, we'll only have one business category to begin. As we grow, I'm sure that'll change, but for now, it'll be one per category. Again, keep sending me.

(6:24 - 6:30)
I know I've got a ton of that. Keep sending me the referrals. Thank you for that.

(6:30 - 6:51)
Also had several business owners, so that's awesome. Some of you have still not been able to DM back, so I gave up on DMs as far as that goes until that gets fixed. So, leg says pop for sure.

(6:52 - 7:10)
Oh boy. Adults, any question? I was told not to ask. Yes, it was always 8.30. The thing is, my phone died.

(7:11 - 7:27)
Well, it didn't die. It was on like 6%, and I hate now that the headphones are the same as the charger, so I had to get it on speakerphone, sorry. And I had to make myself a drink, so I just got out of ketosis today.

(7:34 - 7:48)
Sarah, to people that don't seem to get what. Oh boy. All right, any questions? I don't think there was, well, let's see.

(7:50 - 8:23)
Actually don't know, because I stopped responding, so I don't know if I got any questions. All Smart Wallet transfer refunds should be sent. Every one of those, and I believe I confirmed, I sent you all the transactions before Telegram stopped me from sending DMs.

(8:23 - 8:34)
So, if you've not received a refund, please reach. Actually, no, I see one person. And that is from 325.

(8:35 - 8:55)
Other than that, if you haven't received a refund for your transfer out of Smart Wallet, please reach out with your transaction or wallet so we can get you that refund. We've done several of them. Many, many of them, but please do that.

(8:55 - 9:22)
Also, again, if you know anybody that has funds in that Smart Wallet, please check with them so they can get those out, even if they have them in Expert Wallet, because we need them to write that seed freeze down before we make the full switch over. About before, oh yeah. Yeah, I know some of you wanna keep the FJB for sentimental value, but we're moving on.

(9:23 - 10:05)
All right. Has a security dev given an estimate to finish? Yes, I'll share that with you guys once we're closer. Not sharing any more deadlines with you guys because it really just does not help anything and it's way too stressful for me.

(10:06 - 10:23)
And then the bosses suggest that I don't have these voice chats anymore because, yeah, everything takes longer than expected. I think we kind of expect that at this point. At this point, everything is working as it should.

(10:24 - 10:43)
And I understand there's always gonna be like a next thing, guys. Like, I'm starting to get frustrated, to be honest, with the amount of DMs I'm getting because, yeah, there's always gonna be a next thing. And I think we're done giving timelines for that reason.

(10:44 - 10:55)
It's just beyond stressful. The devs are doing everything they can. We can't have, you know, we can't have a dozen devs working on the same thing.

(10:58 - 11:12)
So I hope that makes sense. Again, everything is working as it should. I know before, it was like you had your funds stuck, you couldn't transfer your funds, you couldn't sell your funds, which I understand how frustrating that is.

(11:12 - 11:26)
I also understand with the fork issue where you guys had no idea what was going on. But at this point, that's as much information as I can give out. Everything is working as it should.

(11:26 - 11:52)
There's always gonna be a next step. And yeah. Will our shipping address be stored on the app if we buy something, or will we have to enter that at every buy? So there's actually, ultimately, we're adding, it's a really cool messaging service that is used between wallets.

(11:55 - 12:28)
That's what we will ultimately have on the app for that purpose, and other purposes also to ask, you know, if you wanna ask questions about an item, for the person-to-person kind of classified ads. Again, probably more questions there than with the business who probably has, you know, all the details about a certain item they have listed. But for the time being, I'm actually not sure about the, I'm sure the advisor has that information.

(12:29 - 12:45)
But I can, actually, I can find out for you probably this weekend. But ultimately, it will be a messaging service between the wallets, which is really, really cool. Um, how legit does, oh, I think I read that.

(12:46 - 13:02)
How legit does this business need to be, and does anyone know the turnaround time on making a lemonade stand business? Lemonade stand, I'm sure you can make that anywhere. Yeah. We do need to have certain documents.

(13:02 - 13:41)
If you send me an email or a DM, I can send you the list. And we're doing this to protect you, the holders, not to make it difficult for businesses to join, but, you know, we wanna keep bad actors, and we wanna protect, ultimately, protect your security and your PPUI purchase. We don't want Joe Schmo making, you know, some non-legit business just to transfer funds out because the percentage that businesses will pay is so, so low.

(13:43 - 13:59)
Yeah, we just wanna make sure that you, the holders, aren't taken advantage by that. So it will need to be a legit business, but that doesn't take much. If you wanna start, like, an at-home business, you know, go start an LLC, go file some documents, and you're set.

(14:01 - 14:40)
So that's not to scare away small business or, like, I don't know if you have a small, I've been thinking if you have, like, a small farm, you can sell, like, your raw milk and eggs and butter and have people pay in PPUI. I don't know about you guys, but here we have, like, little farms with, like, the honor system, and that would be nice if they can just grab, like, a gallon of milk and send you some PPUI, and then you get it in stable coin. Is there a brochure or list of bullet points we can share with potential interested businesses? I don't have a great idea of how to best market PPUI without just pointing it to the team.

(14:41 - 14:56)
Yeah, I mean, I'm always, you know, they can always reach out to me, email, DMs. Emails are better for inquiries like that, or even texts, because it doesn't get lost like DMs do, and I don't get restricted. It doesn't go to archives.

(14:57 - 15:11)
It doesn't, you know, I definitely get, I don't think I've ever received one of your DMs in my spam, so that's great. However, yes, we have the printout of it. Our graphic designer is working to make it pretty.

(15:14 - 15:34)
But if you reach out, or I'll save this, actually, and I'll reach out to this person. I don't think I know who that is. I got warm here.

(15:36 - 15:44)
The bosses don't want voice chats. Should we move to just one a week for now? I mean, we can move to one a week if you guys would like to. I just know when we do that.

(15:45 - 16:23)
Some of you freak out a little bit, and then it just ends up being more, you know, more of a ruckus. And it's not that they don't want you guys happy or in on everything, but when it's causing more stress than it should, then it just seems like sometimes sharing some information when it does more harm than good, then that's kind of where it's like, okay, then we need to kind of reel it back in. Again, not to be secretive, but there's always gonna be the next thing.

(16:25 - 16:52)
And again, I totally understand when with a fork, when you guys, you know, people suspected, but a lot of people didn't know what was going on. And I get it again when funds were stuck in the smart wallet, but at this point, everything is functioning as it should. So yeah, I mean, the alternate is having our coin dead, like really like any alt coin I know of from two and a half years ago.

(16:53 - 17:08)
So while I do appreciate your patience, again, it has become very stressful to just be hounded with that. The devs are working on it, and that's all I have there. I've updated you guys as much as I can.

(17:08 - 17:29)
We're not going to release an app and risk your security. We're always, again, gonna do what's in the best interest of the coin of the community and the future community. And there's absolutely no way we're going to risk your security or risk anything not working correctly.

(17:29 - 17:47)
That's like, we absolutely cannot afford that, and that's the number one priority. I'm sorry if I missed it. If someone asked, do we have any takers? Yes, we have several.

(17:48 - 17:58)
I think the largest is a business that was on Shark Tank, actually. And they were invited to be on Shark Tank. They didn't apply.

(18:06 - 18:24)
And that is the largest business. The smallest is probably business, or I don't know if I'd call them businesses, because I don't know. We're waiting on our attorney to figure that out.

(18:24 - 18:37)
But items that will be sold by Patriot Pay. One that is very crypto-related that I don't know why every person wouldn't buy. Also very low cost.

(18:38 - 19:04)
And then one that's just a little bit more fun with stuff that's already on the site. So that's probably the, I mean, I'd say that that would be the smallest scale business. And then what else? I mean, the survey or poll I posted today should give you a good idea of the people who've, applied so far.

(19:06 - 19:24)
And who've expressed interest, other than the Shark Tank and other than the Patriot Pay items. I'll sell myself. Sam, I don't, I feel like your kid's in life.

(19:24 - 19:35)
Not like that. Shark Tank, yes, they've been on Shark Tank a few times, actually, for a few different products. Really neat.

(19:36 - 19:49)
Amazing couple, I met them at the, I've actually never seen their product. And I've never ran into them or heard of them until the Vegas convention. Super, super sweet couple.

(19:53 - 20:22)
Is a plan to still have political donations on the app? Yes, political donations and non-profit. So, if you know anybody with, again, needs to be a registered 501c3 organization, have them reach out to me. And we'd be happy to put them.

(21:04 - 21:34)
Okay, so. And then we also have the gift card wallet transaction will be worked on this weekend, too, Sunday. 501c3, get the homeschoolers involved.

(21:40 - 21:53)
Does anybody here have an organization? I feel like if you guys did, you probably are not, probably not sharing it. Somebody has to. Somebody here has to have an organization.

(21:56 - 22:17)
Could also start a Patriot Pay organization. I feel like it would have to be either for feeding the hungry or puppies. Yes.

(22:24 - 22:55)
But donations, again, if you know anybody, whoops, where's that key? Oh, bummer. But donations, again, if you know anybody, have them reach out. I don't think many people will say no to accepting donations from us.

(22:55 - 23:31)
With that, though, we do wanna make sure, just like the political donations and the businesses, make sure they align with our values. I know I was talking to a neighbor at the local, my neighborhood park here, and he was really into it and gave me all his son's info. And then when I looked him up, they're very, very left-leaning, and that's not something we'd be interested in or that would align with our values.

(23:31 - 23:55)
So if you do send me any nonprofit organizations, we'll make sure that their values align with ours. That is the number one. Obviously, they have to have the correct filings, but yeah.

(24:04 - 25:03)
That worked, okay, awesome. I don't know which one of you is emailing me. Anything else? Okay, I see a few of you DMed me, so I'll try emailing you back, but I need to take a break between each DM.

(25:04 - 25:14)
Or actually, no, I don't, because they haven't given me my rights back. Let me see. Oh, here it is.

(25:14 - 25:34)
The spam info bot is who DMed me, is that it? Yeah, so he hasn't sent me that I'm out of telegram jail yet, so I think I'm still in there. I will try replying to you guys. If not, again, please DM me on Discord.

(25:35 - 26:11)
Or email, or text. Are the people that are getting the special deal with Patriot, are the people that are getting the special deal with Patriot Pay with their business, will they be permanently grandfathered into the special pricing? The special is for 12 months. So far, but if you send me your business details, I will send you those details.

(26:13 - 27:12)
I think it's a pretty awesome deal, and much better deal than credit cards or really any other, I guess, other than cash. Do you guys want a contest tonight? Or do you wanna stick with just the voting contest? I'm leaving that, I think for a week, to make sure everybody sees it. Or we can see how it goes by Tuesday, voice chat, if everybody is, maybe I'll make an announcement on today's notes, too, to make sure everybody gets a chance to vote.

(27:13 - 27:25)
Looks like coffee is winning. Then energy drinks, God. Good to know I'm not the only caffeine drinker.

(27:27 - 28:06)
Human and pet, C, D, dog treats, all for the good boys. Beef liver won over marijuana. Okay, anything else? This is fine, everything is fine.

(28:27 - 28:38)
The ladies in Japan, it's not beef liver. Hey, beef liver's amazing. If you have any kind of health issues, I recommend beef liver.

(28:39 - 28:46)
Human, oh, wow. Oh, boy. I think I'm good on that.

(28:49 - 29:29)
Human liver sounds worse than chicken liver. I haven't tried these yet, but should be pretty good. I hear they are, I've not tried them yet.

(29:29 - 29:52)
I think that is everything. My emails are all caught up, so if you have sent an email and haven't received your reply back, then I've not received it. Everything should be caught up there.

(29:53 - 30:03)
Discord DMs are caught up. Discord tickets are caught up. The only thing that's not caught up is the Telegram DMs that I am unable to respond to right now.

(30:05 - 30:13)
Oh, actually, somebody asked for a call back. I do need to call someone. Really old number, actually.

(30:13 - 30:38)
Should text before I forget. Oh, shoot, yes. Let's see if they're free Sunday morning.

(30:39 - 30:49)
Sounds like a good time while I'm doing my food bank stuff. Okay, so now everybody's caught up. Minus Telegram DMs.

(30:50 - 31:10)
Again, add me as a contact and then try to DM me and then I'll be able to contact or text you back. But please remember, don't share your info with anybody. We won't ever ask for your seed phrase.

(31:11 - 31:20)
Stop sending me screenshots of your seed phrase. Don't send those to anybody. Of course, I've deleted them when you guys have sent them, but you might not get so lucky with somebody else.

(31:22 - 32:08)
If you know anybody that has, even if they have their expert wallet, I wanna make sure that you guys, you make sure you write down your seed phrase from your expert wallet and just, I would just download Trust Wallet and punch that seed phrase in there so you have access and then also save it in a safe, fireproof, box or something so you have that. But I just wanna clarify again, with the new app signups, you won't have access to your expert wallet through the app. So please make sure you have that seed phrase written down in a safe place and probably just to be safe, entered in Trust Wallet already just to kind of test it and make sure that you wrote everything down correctly.

(32:08 - 32:35)
I know one of you messaged me the other day that one of your seed phrase words is spelled wrong. So you want to test it out in something like Trust Wallet sooner than later since you still have access to the app. Since we are depending on a third party, VESS, to have access to that, it can be pulled at any time and you're at risk for losing your funds.

(32:36 - 33:13)
So I just wanna say this because with Lbank and XT and Probit, even though we gave months notice, there were still some of you that somehow forgot or you had friends or coworkers, et cetera, that missed the date. So that's why I keep repeating that just in case you think of anybody or any wallet that you had and also to clarify, you're not gonna have any access to that account. We just changed the settings actually today to now where you'll be able to use the same email to make a new account with a new service.

(33:14 - 33:24)
But I just wanna clarify that because time is up. So I just don't want you to lose any of those funds. We won't be able to do anything about that.

(33:26 - 33:39)
And I don't want you to lose those coins if you have any. But I think that's all I got. Yeah, let me know if you guys need anything else.

(33:39 - 33:54)
In the meantime, I can post a contest if you guys want one. If you don't, then we can skip it. But other than that, I will keep you updated if I have an update before Tuesday.

(33:54 - 34:10)
Again, our dev that is working on the security issue is out for the weekend today, as of a few hours ago. And then he'll be back to work Sunday. So that's that.

(34:10 - 34:31)
And then our Smart Wallet modifications will be reviewed and reviewed tonight and then added, might be this weekend, but definitely in the next week to our contract. But I think that's all I got. Contact me if you need anything else.

(34:32 - 34:34)
And I'll see you guys in Toronto.
