[Speaker 1]
And then the white paper and educational material, for sure. I know a lot of you have been asking for it. I hear you too.

But again, this is what I mean about some of the foundational stuff that should have been taken care of a long time ago that will help us while we wait on War Room or some of the bigger marketing that we have in store. Okay, when will the app be launch ready? Great question.

I'll keep updating you through everything. I don't have a date right now. I'd be lying to you if I gave you a date.

Have the VES issues been resolved? Yes, absolutely. As far as I know, everything's all good.

If you go, you can test it out too by logging out and signing up with a new email to kind of see how it works now for new users. We also added a VES feedback channel, because the VES devs are absolutely phenomenal. They want to hear the good, the bad, the ugly, and they want to know any issues you're having.

So we added that channel here in the Discord. Feel free to put any feedback for them in there. They're super, super, super smart, super nice guys.

Can you update us on Velo's progress? We're going through a lot of changes as far as that goes, but I will have some updates for you very soon. Has there been any progress with Transact and Fireblock?

We're currently waiting on Fireblock to get back to us, because I think the last time I updated you, Transact and Fireblock, you know, Transact was saying, nope, Fireblock needs to do something. Fireblock was saying, nope, Transact needs to do something. So we're just waiting on Fireblock now.

Next one, will B or B join a voice chat? Yes, absolutely. This week, even their assistants have been out of the office.

And I don't mean out of the office, taking days off, just out of the office, like in Florida or what have you, getting work done. So we're working together to get a time scheduled. I know it's super frustrating, but hey, we have Boris and Bannon, so very, very hard to schedule with.

They are more than happy and more than willing to come on and talk to you all.

[Speaker 2]
Let me see, I think that's all the questions I got in my inbox. So let me go to the chat, see if I missed anything. Wait, wait, wait, like FJB gift cards?

Yes, absolutely. Will it be B or B?

[Speaker 1]
Probably Boris first. Boris, as busy as he is, is just a little bit less busy than Bannon, I think. How many hours a week is Velo contracted to work on this?

Can we hire a full-time dev?

[Speaker 2]
Definitely working on that. Donnie sent me marketing funds. Okay, sorry, I thought that was a question.

Awesome. Any other questions? I have my drink here.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know what everybody else is drinking. I like these, they're called Neutral. I don't know, it's a vodka seltzer with real juice, pineapple one.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Any progress on getting set up to promote FJB at rallies? Yes, we are working on our first date, so that'll be super cool for a booth. Very, very excited about that, which is why we are really trying to get the gift cards on the app done and the merch.

Very excited about that.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, that looks good, JL. When is the next TPUSA to Iraq? I'm not sure.

[Speaker 1]
No, Finn and his lawyer did so, so much for us. December 17th. Ooh, I wonder, is that too late?

[Speaker 2]
Let me write that down. I wonder if it's too late to sign up for that.

[Speaker 1]
If it's not, I would love to get us a booth there, and if the gift cards and merch should be done before that time.

[Speaker 2]
That would be super cool. Hi, Croc. Okay, anything?

Mike Lindell.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, let's get him. We're some talk with a few other really big names, so I will update as soon as we have updates on those. I can't wait to share with you.

[Speaker 2]
There should be a lot of new updates coming. Let's see. Okay, so there's not any more questions.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see. I have to get something taken care of before we share this exciting news.

[Speaker 2]
Give me just a second here, though. I promise it won't be bad news like last time I had to get off to do something, but give me a second here. I think it'll all be very good news for us, very exciting.

I'm super pumped about it. Sorry I feel so awkward when I'm here not speaking or anything. I feel like the music should come back for a little bit.

Just a second here. Make sure everything's good to share.

[Speaker 3]
Take down the CCP. Follow me and I'ma set us free. Take down the CCP.

[Speaker 4]
Let me tell you what I've been through, baby. Lived a life that was hella unfair. Seen things that been driving me crazy.

In a country where the leaders don't care. Didn't think we had the courage to change it. Tore it down and they weren't prepared.

Everything that they kept us from saying. Now we're talking and they better be scared. Take and take and take from us.

Tell us what and who to love. Swear I finally had enough.

[Speaker 3]
It's time to rise above. Take down the CCP. Take down the CCP.

Follow me and I'ma set us free. Take down the CCP. I said take down the CCP.

Take down the CCP. Communism's get to me. If you're gonna kill your families, fuck the CCP.

[Speaker 2]
Communism's get to me. Okay, I'm back.

[Speaker 1]
So we have some exciting news. I know I've heard a lot of talk about the charity and the reflections. And I know a lot of people didn't want that any longer.

Like as far as our tax structure, they didn't want charity coming out of that. They didn't think reflections was a good idea right now. They wanted the tax structure, the 8% to be used, but be put to better use.

So we did take that into account. And I know there's a lot of you that still wanted the charity and reflections aspect. So what we did, and what news we'll have coming, we'll have more details about this, is we're actually partnering up with Baby FJB.

And we will get reflections and charity done through Baby FJB. That's a happy balance. That way, hopefully, it makes everybody happy.

I think this will be great for us. It'll be great if they decide to get on the app. And we'll just have a ton of other updates for you coming.

But I think this is super exciting, and will be great for us. And that way we can keep our tax structure. We'll be available for even more options.

So I wanted to share that with you all.

[Speaker 2]
Let me know if you have any questions. Marketing is coming. Awesome.

Other questions? Will FJB become its own blockchain?

[Speaker 1]
Hey, anything is possible. I'm not sure how much is required for that. Of course, we'll have to ask the tech guys.

[Speaker 2]
That's not my area, as you all know. Oops. Well, I had to buy some Baby so I can start getting reflections.

[Speaker 1]
Has Baby FJB been vetted to make sure the original devs don't steal funds like we just experienced? I think the Baby has two new devs, and I think they transferred ownership of that contract. I'm sure Moku and JL will correct me if that's wrong.

Will Baby FJB be in the app?

[Speaker 2]
Anything is possible. I'm not sure, Donnie, but I'm not going to read your question. And yes, our funds were misplaced.

[Speaker 1]
We do not know. We're not naming anything like this. Are Baby FJB devs doxxed?

Anybody know their real names? I believe so. They'll confirm that.

I'm sure Moku and JL. I know, I know their real names. We've yet to get on with all legal documents and DAs and IDs will be signed.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome. Is that all the questions for tonight?

[Speaker 1]
Moku says under new ownership, previous owner and dev have no access to the contract. Boom. Awesome.

It's a great day. It's a reason to celebrate. I know our funds, FJB are also in a new dev, the LP is in a new dev wallet, along with charity and marketing.

I'm super excited about that. It's a huge deal. I know it's been a long road.

So it's really, really a huge, huge deal. Feels good to start off with a clean slate. And this is just the beginning.

It's finally, finally time. Finally, our time. And I think you all will be very, very happy.

I am super excited, super relieved. Like I said, we even locked BNB's wallets until we can move their funds to a more secure wallet that we make sure nobody has keys to. Can you clarify what relationship is between baby FJB and FJB?

They clearly work together, but now it's official. We will have more clarification on that very, very soon. For now, I just wanted to let everybody in on the behind the scenes and let you all know that we are partnering together.

I mainly also wanted to tell you this because before, the way that baby FJB contract worked with Reflections, it was actually taxing, our FJB tax was taxing them three times over. And the Reflections weren't working as well as they could have. So now we made it so the Reflections and everything on their end will only get taxed once, just like every other FJB buyer, and this will help Reflections-wise.

And I also wanted to share because there's been a lot of talk and because we have our change in tax structure coming up. And I know there was a lot of talk about Reflections and charity and a lot of people really just weren't wanting that. So I think this is a perfect, perfect, happy medium.

You can get your Reflections and you can get the charity done if you choose. If you choose not to, hey, that's good too, right? And that way we can have our 8% be used for other ways too.

So it kind of gives us a lot more options.

[Speaker 2]
Are the burned coins retrievable?

[Speaker 1]
No, I'm not sure if you're talking about baby FJB or FJB, but I imagine any burned coins are not retrievable. If somebody wants to correct me, please go ahead and do. Somebody says, so is it smart to buy baby FJB right now?

I'm not sure. I cannot give you financial advice. I do know that we do have a lot in store and a lot of a partnership coming, so that'll be great.

[Speaker 2]
All right, that looks like all the questions.

[Speaker 1]
But if you have any other questions come up, you know my inbox is always open for questions or the chats. Oh yes, we do have a bi-party tonight. What time is that starting, Dianne?

Because last time I got it wrong. Is it still 7.30 this week? 7 or 7.30?

[Speaker 2]
8 p.m pacific. Let's see what time that is. Eastern.

Okay, that's pretty late.

[Speaker 1]
That's 11 o'clock, 11 p.m eastern then. I guess you could buy beforehand too. So 11 p.m eastern, there is a bi-party every Friday, a buy FJB party. Just put, you know, your 5, 10, 20. It'll be a $30 minimum if you're getting it from Transac. You ought to buy some FJB and build your wallet that way with the prices being so low right now.

[Speaker 2]
What? Somebody has the times wrong. Okay, so it's 8 p.m eastern. All right, that's a little bit better.

[Speaker 1]
8 p.m eastern. So when about 2? Yeah, and yeah, it's 7, 8, 30 minutes.

No, you're okay. Okay, it happens. I'm in Arizona and our time never changes, so I get that.

I'm right there with you. Cool. So in 30 minutes, buy night will start.

Nice way to load up your bags with $10, $20, $30 and slowly load up that way. The money you saved on Starbucks for the week.

[Speaker 2]
When Sarah docs real name. My name is Sarah, actually. Yeah, I could do both.

Carry link. Yeah, I wish.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Thank you. Well, I think that's all the updates.

I think. Let me know. Like I said, let me know if you have any other questions.

I think I've answered everything I see. Again, thank you all for your patience. We are so relieved.

This really is a huge win, especially with everything that's transpired in the last month or so. So it's awesome. Our funds are looking to be very safe with new keys in safe hands.

And we'll keep you updated on the lock of the LP. Again, at this point, it will be locked BNBs wallets too. So at this point, it's just trying to figure out the best way with the market the way it is.

And the little scare we had with the third party that we had our LP locked in up until today, we just didn't want to be in that same situation. Again, I feel like we've all been through enough. So we're trying to avoid any more that mess.

So you guys have a wonderful night. Thank you for joining. And I'll be back on telegram voice on Tuesday.
