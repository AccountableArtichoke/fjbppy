(0:00 - 0:08)
Got that started. Koi hoyo came here today. Well that's good.

(0:15 - 0:28)
Somebody need a new mic. Okay, alright. So, I can barely hear you.

(0:36 - 12:45)
Try putting your volume up. because I'm using my same my same everything okay let me see I don't think I have any questions in my inboxes I think just a bunch of stuff yeah catch up on those tonight on the app again please don't use the app I keep getting messages from you same users updating me on the issues with the app that I've asked you to please not use right now so thank you for the updates but I have stopped replying to the several of you who have told several times to please not use the app right now I'll post an announcement as a reminder but please don't use the app right now don't use it don't transact with it don't transfer in and out buy sell anything okay the devs are actively working on it we made some great progress in the last 24 to 48 hours we are stalled now waiting for a partner one of the errors coming up it's definitely due to something on our partner's end not sure how active they are on the weekend to be completely honest with you they're usually not that active on the weekends but like I said we've made huge progress in the last few days and actually even this week so that's great news our educational videos look amazing we're gonna try we're gonna try putting them with a voiceover and without kind of go from there I know generally people like my mom and grandma and dad generally they like voiceovers however the issue is we've tried several like dozens of AI like you know paid AI ones and they just specifically with our words and everything we need they just sound like crap so I'll update you guys on that but the videos themselves the text in there look amazing so that's gonna be no problem getting that integrated into the app we still have a few weeks left we're about halfway through March so plenty of time they're still looking good for our roadmap which is excellent news yeah that's everything I've got got some good buys for the contest I will be sending I have several of you to make payments to I'll make sure to make those by the end of the weekend just been so busy everything else Dan in the house golf ball hail we've not gotten hail yet probably because it's not so cold I mean it's pretty cold for us but generally it needs to be a little bit cooler for us to get hail here we still do a few times a year but just holy smokes I'm hoping it doesn't rain all weekend I'm not a fan of how it makes me feel gargled running water sound hmm doesn't look like it's raining outside so it's probably not how is the stuff going with the former partner good decentralized has an amazing voice when do you think the first update of the app will be pushed through as soon as the smart wallet and expert mode is working which again we think right now is due to the issue that on our partner's hand I sound muted that's weird I'm not let's see is this better for the discord mic sounded like your hand was oh probably because I have to put one earphone on this side and the other sorry about that glad it sounds better trust wallet update no we do not have a trustful update we're still waiting on Apple Docs approved no we did they did ask for more documents because apparently they could not confirm my phone number so for Patriot Paid it was obviously my cell phone number because we don't need our different phone number yet so they did ask for more proof and we've sent that over that's the partner that was holding things up fixed that issue not completely but our attorney is handling that. Is the team looking at account abstraction as an update to the current expert wallet model? Not as far as I know. 

My friend has about $900 of Bitcoin on the app and wants to buy Patriot Paid it. I know you said if you have Patriot Pay on smart wallet that you offer to airdrop us PPY sooner. Can this offer extend to my friend's Bitcoin on the app so he can buy PPY? Unfortunately no because that's not the same so with Patriot Pay for those that really want it sooner we can do that because then we're not going to airdrop to their smart wallet. 

With Bitcoin I have no way of receiving that Bitcoin payment from him so I hope that makes sense because we don't we don't control your funds the only reason I can airdrop to a different wallet for Patriot Pays because we have the fork and we haven't airdropped to those smart wallets yet so I would just be airdropping to your new wallet instead if that makes sense. I think all smart wallets got airdropped. No. 

Yeah we have not airdropped to smart wallets. It's 4.20 somewhere. Oh boy. 

Oh boy. Win first round of marketing. I'm ready. 

Can't wait. Gosh. I think we'll be up and going before the halving. 

When I thought. I've not kept up. How do big smart wallets have PPY already? Unless we somehow missed some. 

Sometime in the future. Right now we're still, especially with the developments we've had this week, we should be all good to still have everything that was on the roadmap, that is on the roadmap, completed by the end of the quarter. If that does change, I will update yours. 

If only I was a dev, I would make sure it went faster. I can't answer any tax questions. What is preventing the airdrop from being completed? Some of them are smart wallet ones. 

We are waiting until smart wallets fixed in case we need to airdrop to different wallets. So that's why it's taking so long. So when app comes out to us, then my friend can use the wrapped Bitcoin on Patreon to buy PPY on that app.

(12:47 - 13:03)
Yes, he should be able to. You said he has it in smart wallet, correct? Yeah, he'll be able to. He'll just have to swap.

(13:15 - 13:31)
Once this partner gets their stuff done, it's an error we're receiving. The dev is saying it's from their side. So once that's fixed, the dev can continue working on this smart wallet.

(13:36 - 13:59)
And once, well, like I said, now it's impacting the expert wallet too. So once that's a new dev, no, this is our same dev who was our primary dev for our contract. For our PPY contract.

(14:04 - 14:27)
But, sorry, I was answering that. Once they get their stuff done, then he can continue with the, well, that'll go, we'll deploy that for you all to test. And he'll be adding, I believe the next step is adding the videos to the app, the educational videos.

(14:27 - 16:02)
Can you talk a little about the education plan? Is it just videos? What all is the plan to cover in education videos? Yes, so starting very basic on what is cryptocurrency and then we go from there. So far our video guy, I believe, has two completed. And I think he has 15 on the docket. 

So he has two of those completed. Minus the music slash voiceovers. But two that are absolutely done.

(16:04 - 16:18)
But yeah, it'll start from there for somebody that's off the street or off war room who has absolutely no clue what crypto is. Then build from there. There'll be very basic videos.

(16:20 - 16:41)
We'll also include links if they want to dive deeper. But we are limited in what we can provide, information we can provide. So we provide the basics and then more links.

(16:44 - 17:05)
But other videos that are geared for boomers, pretty much. I mean, even if not necessarily boomers, like I think my parents are not boomers yet. Or I guess they won't be with that definition.

(17:05 - 17:42)
But definitely with somebody, you know, our goal is to make crypto mainstream, right? But I think a lot of younger folks here, like a lot of people here, FGB was their first crypto. So I think once the basics are out of the way, because everybody here knows what crypto is, right? Once we get those videos out of the way, I think it'll probably be a little bit more beneficial for everybody across the board, hopefully. For most people.

(17:43 - 18:07)
Not Nolan, probably. But the rest of you. Let's see.

(18:07 - 18:19)
Turned off my music, apparently. Find Peggy's playlist. And win PPY ETF.

(18:24 - 18:41)
There's so, so many things to do. Just gotta get this dang smart wallet that's been my biggest pain. But also will be the coolest thing once it's doing what it's supposed to be.

(18:47 - 19:10)
Can our first business to accept PPY be my patriot supply? Oh, I've seen that. I've never actually purchased one. I do want a freeze dryer.

(19:18 - 19:58)
Wireless solar power bank. Could probably charge everything here during the summers with the sun I have. Looking at the wallets.

(19:58 - 20:15)
You sent some L-Bank wallets. P-P-Y. Are you talking about the L-Bank website? No.

(20:40 - 21:00)
Oh, we can definitely try. There is a few. So by next week I'm maybe testing.

(21:00 - 21:37)
I cannot give you a date. If I do... Then... I'm forwarding that info right now up here. But yeah, we can definitely.

(21:38 - 22:02)
I think we have a few really awesome businesses. I'm really excited for this one that I met at the Vegas convention. Okay.

(22:24 - 22:29)
Well, that's all I got. I'm glad. I don't think I have anything else.

(22:45 - 23:03)
I don't have anything else. Oh, shush. Coinholio.

(23:04 - 23:45)
What? Coinholio. Who are you? Oh, we haven't mentioned... Finn's awesome. Finn is wonderful.

(23:46 - 24:16)
Okay. Anything else? Who keeps ending? Somebody has to keep ending that. What is going on? I'm going to change this, I think.

(24:30 - 24:39)
I don't know if the internet is doing that. But my internet has been pretty steady. Or if one of you keeps ending the chat.

(24:39 - 24:58)
Tell me. Yeah, I got booted too. I always have no clue because I don't keep the voice chat window up.

(24:58 - 25:06)
I minimize it. So I know it's not me who stopped it. Pierre wants Velo.

(25:07 - 25:15)
Velo's around. He just travels a lot now. He's doing pretty well.

(25:16 - 25:33)
I spoke to him, actually, just a few days ago. Just travels a lot and is having a good time. Ryan's a good guy.

(25:33 - 25:56)
Actually, what was it? Just... What was it? I think it was a few days ago. It showed me you weren't in the voice chat for about two minutes. Yeah, it looked like it kicked me off too.

(26:04 - 26:27)
Ultrasuede says telegram dropped. Do we know who Advisor is yet? What do you need to know? It's not me. That's all you need to know.

(26:27 - 26:36)
Just like with the devs. I am not the devs and I am not the Advisor. They are real people that exist.

(26:43 - 26:51)
At what point do we all text you our seed phrase? Oh, anytime. Just go ahead. Just kidding, please don't do that.

(26:51 - 27:19)
Some of you have screenshotted me your seed phrases. Okay, well I think that's everything I got. Please don't share your seed phrase or click on any weird links.

(27:19 - 27:27)
Don't ever send me your seed phrase screenshots or otherwise. Or any other admins. Don't give it to anybody.

(27:28 - 27:33)
Make sure it's somewhere safe. Written. Not on just a piece of paper.

(27:34 - 27:43)
Those stainless steel... Kind of... I don't know what to call them. Sheets that I put once. They're super cheap.

(27:44 - 27:54)
Use a Dremel to... Carve your seed on there. And save them in case of a fire. Or anything like that.

(27:54 - 28:02)
When our community member's house caught on fire. He wanted you guys to know. Please don't leave your seed phrase on a piece of paper.

(28:09 - 28:20)
I'm very, very afraid of fires. Also, because I have birds. But, yeah.

(28:21 - 28:37)
I'll keep you guys updated. Should we leave to save the contest? The end of voice chat. Okay, let's see how many... Buys we have.

(28:38 - 28:50)
Then we can pick a number. And then I need to pay you all. Let's start at the most recent.

(28:51 - 29:25)
That first one. That happened right here. 310 Let's see, where is 1510? Okay.

(29:26 - 29:39)
Got one. Oh, we gotta start here. Got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

(29:42 - 29:48)
11, 12, 13. 14. Okay.

(29:50 - 30:18)
Starting from the most recent one. 3random.com 3random.com Okay. I'm through.

(30:20 - 31:00)
14 and... Number 6. Screenshot it and figure out who... So, congratulations to the winner. Not sure if you guys know the wallet. I'll check it in a second here.

(31:03 - 31:56)
Posted it on Telegram. Apparently, that's also number 7. Okay. Alright, well.

(32:01 - 32:24)
PJ Anderson. Before you go, will anything be released while we wait for the app? I'm not sure. Our app will be... Getting the smart wallet will be in Word.

(32:24 - 32:37)
To clarify, not waiting for the Apple Store. I know right now in the Apple Store, you know, even though our app name changed, the listing is different. We're not waiting for that.

(32:39 - 32:48)
But yeah, we just need the smart wallet working. Also, the devs really need them. Majorly our main dev.

(32:48 - 34:14)
Working on getting the wallet fixed before adding the educational stuff and then Patriot Papers. I think it'll be good because while he's working on that, as soon as he's done with the wallets, we'll get that version with the wallets working out to you all and then the few after those for you all to test to find any more bugs. Yeah, but I will keep you updated. 

Like I said, this week and especially the past day and a half, two days has been great finally with partners and others finally working with us. So, I will keep you updated. Again, if it does take much longer this whole smart wallet issue because the issues we're having now are not just smart wallet related. 

They're both expert and smart wallet. But if it continues being just smart wallet then we will continue with just expert mode while that gets worked on and carried on with everything else. But like I said, we should all be good so far to finish everything else on the roadmap as it stands right now.

(34:14 - 34:35)
I'm hoping the wallets don't take too much longer because then that will change. But I will keep you guys updated. I'm hoping everything goes as well and smoothly as this week has been.

(34:40 - 34:53)
Alright, I think that's everything. Again, please don't share your info with anybody. I feel like it's been a while since one of you has gotten scammed.

(34:53 - 35:30)
If you ask for help in the general chat, admin will never DM you first. I won't ever DM you first and our devs will never DM you or call you first. Always ask in the chat if you have any doubt please. 

I'd hate for you to lose coins that way unfortunately. There's nothing we can do about that if you get scammed so definitely double check with us in the chats, not in DMs because you could be just DMing the scammer. But you all have a good weekend, safe weekend, and then I'll be here.

(35:30 - 35:37)
I will catch up on DMs and emails. I think I have a few emails. I don't know.

(35:37 - 35:54)
I don't know how you guys feel. I feel like I should start with all the people emailing me like I should start giving them the Discord and the Telegram channels to join you all but not sure if you all are ready for that. Shoot.

(35:55 - 36:15)
My Telegram is disconnected. What the heck? My internet has been good since Tuesday's worst chat by the way. So I almost feel like it's Telegram this time.

(36:19 - 36:53)
Oh shoot. It's not disconnecting. I wonder if it's can't be my VPN, right? I don't know if that was a coincidence as soon as I turned my VPN off, it came back online. 

It's very weird. Sorry about that. I don't know why my Telegram is disconnecting.

(36:54 - 37:16)
But I will catch up on DMs tonight and emails if you guys are ready for it. I can start telling everybody to email me which there's quite a bit to come in the chat if you all are feeling friendly. If you're not, then I'll just have them continue emailing.

(37:29 - 37:47)
Okay. I think that's everything. I will post a recording right now. 

Let me just convert the file and I'll go ahead and post that with some notes. Got the contest winners. I will have all the contest winners sent out by the end of this weekend.

(37:51 - 37:54)
I think that's everything. Thank you guys. Have a great night.
