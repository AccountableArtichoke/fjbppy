(0:00 - 0:20)
It's just you and me, the Fin, and everybody else. I'll wait before going into the big, massive, giant update that you all guys, you know, want to know and have been waiting for. So, I know you guys have been seeking an update from us.

(0:22 - 0:25)
Alright, I'm in. Okay, perfect. Yeah, a bunch of them just joined over.

(0:25 - 0:31)
Stop being silly geese. So, they're coming. These people are coming.

(0:32 - 0:42)
It's okay. There's just five left, so I think let's get going. That song is in my head, though.

(0:43 - 0:47)
I know. That song has been in my head since October. It hasn't come out.

(0:48 - 1:05)
I don't want it to ever go out, actually. So, shall we get going? Yeah, let's get going. We have two more people in the other chat, so one of them is Sun Devil, which she's probably just AFK.

(1:06 - 1:10)
Yeah, I think it's just AFK. Let's get going. Yeah, let's do it.

(1:11 - 1:20)
Great. What's up, everybody? Eric and I just wanted to join today to give some updates. I'm going to let Eric take the stage because he has been through similar situations to this, and he has prevailed.

(1:21 - 1:51)
So, without further ado, Eric Fimman. Hello. Thank you, Grant. 

I appreciate the wonderful introduction. So, to give you guys full transparency on everything that's going on is we had our big app launch today, absolutely incredible response. We got an insane amount of users, an incredible amount of people buying crypto, depositing, et cetera, et cetera, and it was an amazing launch.

(1:51 - 2:38)
One of the APIs that we used for this cash-to-crypto conversion, we had been on the phone with our tech team, really good friends, very honest and transparent over the political nature of this project, the political connotations that it has. But today, as we blew past basically all these metrics and anything that I think on their side they would have ever, clearly more than any of their other companies or clients that they use as an API for, we blew past all of that, which was incredible. But it forced another compliance check on their side of things.

(2:39 - 3:42)
And then compliance teams are, I guess it comes with the personality of being a compliance person, but they came in and then they looked at it and they completely shut us down. And then they sent us a questionnaire saying if we want to get re-enabled, that basically the point of the questions were, are you working with Steve Bannon or not? Is he the person that runs this project or not? And what is your affiliation? Not being very legally smart about it, but eluding those questions clearly, giving very legal questions where you either say no, and that's a lie, which we don't lie, or you say yes, and then they say, well, we don't want to work with Steve Bannon in any way. So again, we had been working with these people for a very long time, very transparent on the political nature of this.

(3:42 - 4:06)
I don't know how they would not know that Steve Bannon's affiliation, but I guess I think the compliance people have not looked at this that seriously, and the tech people were just looking at it, and the tech people are sane and logical engineers. So anyways, they de-platformed us, shut us down. So that means temporarily by them shutting us down, the app is down.

(4:06 - 4:23)
And I think this caused a change in the price based off of people seeing that the app is down for today. So that's what happened. That is the state of affairs, the state of the union.

(4:23 - 5:12)
And our devs are working their asses off, pardon my French, on a fix, because if you look at it, the amount of traction that we were getting was incredible, like absolutely amazing traction, unbelievable traction, right? Amazing numbers, even past the screenshots that we were sharing, like you had noted the transactions, the amount of stuff that we're going to – it was incredible, right? And people are probably wondering, sorry to interrupt, Eric, but people are probably wondering why it wasn't showing on, I guess, the BSC scan or whatever. It's because ACH has a delay, and ACH has a few days delay. So we saw the number of sign-ups, the teams saw the number of sign-ups, they saw the number of people, website hits, they saw the number of people creating accounts.

(5:13 - 5:29)
I don't know, I guess, the exact story, but there was 4,500 new people. But from what I heard and what I understand is that doesn't hit for like one to three business days. So it depends on your bank, it depends on what state you're in, it depends on a lot of things.

(5:31 - 6:04)
So I'm just basically passing on that information in terms of the number of sign-ups, in terms of the number of people that are using the app that worked fantastically, that was built from scratch. Things just get out of your control, and Harvey, 4,500. Absolutely. 

So anyway, thank you, Grant, for that. It was a lot of project. We were projecting, I would say, tens of thousands of users and deposited users by the end of the day.

(6:06 - 6:19)
And again, this was just the beginning, this kickoff this morning. We're going to, again, still have all this set up for the rest of the week. So our developers are working night and day to get this back up and running.

(6:21 - 6:46)
And it looks like what the developers are estimating to us is that it's going to take a week just to get this up, back, and running, because basically we're going to have to rebuild this whole API ourselves and do it ourselves. So that way we can come back even in a way where you can't get, like, some API can pull you out. Obviously, nothing's perfect, but we had, again, a relationship with these guys.

(6:47 - 7:03)
But I guess if you want something done right, you do it yourself. And that's amazing. And then I think what we're going to do is, once we have this all built out, we should, honestly, Grant, we should create an API to go out and so other people can't get pulled like we did today.

(7:04 - 7:41)
So that is the state of affairs. That is why the coin is with that. Give a little background on Freedom Phone. 

Give a little background on MyPillow. Give a little background on experiences that you've seen in terms of deplatforming and the end result. Exactly. 

So this has happened to the best of them, I think is the point that Grant is trying to make, is that people get deplatformed. You saw what happened with MyPillow, and it was a bank, right? So we're much smarter on the banking side of things. But they got pulled from the bank front.

(7:42 - 7:51)
And again, the crypto was all safe. The cryptocurrency is good. It's just that cash-to-crypto kind of bridge, that's where it's tricky, and that's what we're using an API for.

(7:52 - 8:06)
So we totally have seen people go through this before. With Freedom Phone, I launched Freedom Phone. We made $3.5 million our first day.

(8:07 - 8:21)
And then the payment processors, the platform does on that front. And I picked up myself up by bootstraps and made that an even bigger success than it ever was. And we got much more sales, and we did an incredible job with that.

(8:22 - 8:32)
And you see again what happened with MyPillow. They got more sales after they got deplatformed than they did before. And I think that's going to be the same thing that happens for us.

(8:32 - 8:41)
So I guess all that I would ask of you guys is just be patient for a week. We had this big marketing push planned. That's just going to be pushed for next week, and that's it.

(8:41 - 9:04)
So it's just a bump in the road, and a bump in the road that is going to make us even more uncancellable, make us even tougher. And we're going to come back just like MyPillow, just like Freedom Phone, and just like many other people that have been to platform, the conservative movement, and go even further than we would have just if we weren't to platform in the first place. And we're going to be much stronger for it.

(9:05 - 9:15)
So it's annoying. So if you hear that in my voice, it's certainly annoying. But we're able to fix it, and I think that's what matters, and that's what's important.

(9:15 - 9:30)
And just so you guys know, and I'm happy to provide the addresses to prove this, but I bought more FGB coin today after this. So I didn't sell any after this happened. I bought more.

(9:31 - 9:54)
So I guess that's what I chose to do because in the end, if the deep state, if these people come after you, if these financial systems come after you, you have to double down, and that's what you're going to do. That's what you got to do, and I think you're going to see that from Steve. I think you're going to see that from Boris, and you're going to see that – I think you're going to see that better than you ever could have hoped from us as well.

(9:55 - 10:24)
So again, I am just someone that decided to join on this project after the fact, and I believe in it. And if you want to go in my background of Bitcoin all the way back to 2011, I mean the amount of fluctuations and the roller coasters that happened, being in Bitcoin from 2011 to now, that was much more extreme. So if I can ask for your guys' patience, I'm sure Grant asked the same.

(10:25 - 10:59)
Just give us a week here, and then the marketing plan and kickoff that we had, I'm glad this happened actually before we went on every TV station, every radio station, and have every influencer that we know blast us out when we had this, when this was going to happen. So I'm glad that this happened today versus after that it had all come out, because that's what happened with Freedom Phone. You had this big, massive launch on one day, and then we got to platform the next day.

(10:59 - 11:19)
And I kind of wish that happened when just a little bit was trickling in relatively versus all of it, or a big chunk of it that was going to come from that big marketing campaign. So I ask for your guys' patience. I bought more today, and I really appreciate you guys coming in.

(11:20 - 11:25)
And oh, yeah, also someone had a question. What about the money you put in the app? That money's all there. It's safe.

(11:27 - 11:45)
And it is all good, and we will be providing tutorials. If you have struggle with basically this API that was holding the money, that is no problem. So we'll provide an instruction manual for more info on that.

(11:48 - 11:58)
So, again, this was a third-party issue. So I'm just reading the messages. This was a third-party issue, not on our front, and we're going to make it a first-party.

(11:58 - 12:14)
We're going to fix it with a first-party solution. And if we ever have to work with anybody, people that we trust and people that we know, we could pull it off. But someone asked, does your team have lawyers? We absolutely have lawyers, and we're going to use them.

(12:17 - 12:27)
So your money is safe. You can get it out still today if you want to, and we're going to provide an instruction manual right this second. We're not holding it, right? We're not holding the bag.

(12:29 - 12:42)
So I just want to make sure people are safe, and we'll provide an instruction manual if you guys have any questions. And you can always contact our support as well. Thank you guys all for joining.

(12:42 - 12:52)
We'll provide any updates as they come in. Just know that, like, if you're watching War Room today, like, you're so excited. That's the worst part.

(12:53 - 13:01)
You're so excited. Because they do this, Grant. They do this to people that get traction, right? Like, for example, like Getter.

(13:01 - 13:11)
I think it's going to get banned. They don't ban you right the second before you have – when you have nothing to lose. They only ban it when you have momentum to lose.

(13:11 - 13:30)
And, like, Getter is going to get up to 50 million users and start being a threat to Twitter and Facebook and everybody, and then they're going to get banned off the app stores, right? And that was the purpose of the phone and everything. And then that's what they're trying to do with us now today is when – they didn't wait until when we had nothing to lose. They waited until when we were getting incredible momentum.

(13:31 - 13:42)
So just so you guys know, we prove the market. We prove the market here that people want this to be successful. And that this can be successful.

(13:42 - 13:57)
And it's just going to be a one-week bump in the road. So it's not fun, but I think that's life, you know. And I think everybody in this chat is tough, and I think we're going to come back – actually, I know we're going to come back even stronger than ever before.

(13:59 - 14:22)
So the purpose of this coin and then the happy warrior mindset. That Lee Kuan Yew had a quote, and I want to read it here. Let me pull it up. 

Let me pull it up. It is – give me your patience for one second. Whoever governs Singapore must have that iron in him or give it up.

(14:23 - 14:33)
This is not a game of cards. This is your life and mine. I've spent a whole lifetime building this, and as long as I'm in charge, nobody is going to knock it down.

(14:33 - 14:44)
And that is exactly the same sentiment that I have for FJB and this cryptocurrency and everything that we're working on here. Thank you so much. I appreciate your feedback.

(14:45 - 14:46)
Thank you. Have a good one.
