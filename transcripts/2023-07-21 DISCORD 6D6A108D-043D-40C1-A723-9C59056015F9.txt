[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Sorry, I'm not sure if you could hear my dogs barking. Somebody decided to ring the doorbell.

They're going nuts. All right, happy Friday. So, I don't have any major news or anything like that.

I just figured we haven't done a Discord voice for like a few weeks now. So in case anybody had questions, I haven't gotten any of my DMs. The dev is still working. Everything so far so good.

So that's great. I will keep you updated with anything that comes up from him. XT.

With XT delisting us. So they first said, well it was due to our low volume initially, which has happened a few times before. They initially said they wanted $10,000.

Then they said they wanted $15,000. And now they want $50,000 to $60,000. So that's not going to be happening within the near future.

However, we did talk to them about the date. And everything is all good there. So even though you need to have, let me see, your coins.

They want everybody to try to transfer their coins really before the end of July. But if you don't hit that date, if you're not here every day, if you don't keep up with the news, you know, what have you. You went offline for whatever reason.

You forgot about your coins. All you'll have to do is contact XT and they'll go ahead and take care of you. So even though that option may not work automatically after the 23rd or the 25th.

All you'll have to do is contact their support and they'll go ahead and take care of you. If you have any issues, please reach out to me and I'll have it taken care of. It's definitely unfortunate because we wanted to keep both of our exchanges between XT and LB.

I think that's the ones people use, users use most often. But that's just not in the budget right now and they will not budge. So either way, the goal is really to make our app the main platform to trade FJBs.

So LB is better. Yeah, I haven't used XT in so long. Are they going to dump the rest?

Uh, what are you talking about? Rand. We have 600 million.

Okay, so that, no, that's FJBs. That is not XTs. The 600 million coins that are in the XT account are coins that FJB had to deposit.

So those are our coins. Those are not XTs and we're in the works to get those back because, as you know, those are under the old team's accounts. But no worries, they have been frozen.

And we are working with XT to get those coins back and make sure that FJBs are not rightfully getting those coins back. And the team has no plans of dumping them right now. If that changes, I will definitely let you know.

Somebody did ask in Discord today regarding if political donations are still being considered, and that's a yes to add political donations on our app. Yeah, we're already working on ideas to make the app a little bit more user-friendly. I will probably release actually something to you all before the dev starts working on those changes.

But I think we have some good changes in the works for the app. Super excited about that and super excited to make it a little bit more user-friendly. We've been getting some feedback from people who haven't used the app before to kind of get a little bit more of their feedback.

And yeah, I know a lot of you have had issues with the app too, so that's definitely something the dev will start working on once he's done with the current task.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
I think looking through my Telegram DMs, I don't think I have any details there. Is the smart wallet staying? That's undecided.

Once this dev starts working on that, we're gonna see just how smart the smart wallet really is, and if that's something we want to continue with. The idea behind the smart wallet was great, but if we can't get it to function as intended, then we'll move forward with something else. And I think that's the point we're at right now.

We're not doing the whole penny by Sunday or any of the scammy pep talks anymore, but we are moving forward and we are, no matter what we run into, we're just going to continue moving forward and keep getting better. That is very slow and steady, but things need to get completed correctly and that is the team's and remains the team's number one priority, because the goal is this is more of a long-term project, so if that takes so much longer to get something actually done correctly rather than, you know, penny by Sunday or what have you, then so be it. Of course, with that, we'll have, you know, a lot of the old holders leave and that's happened and that's, you know, that's completely fine.

As the project changes, I think our holders will change too. A lot of holders are still here and yeah. Any update on ours from the dev?

No, I've not gotten an update from him today. I'm not sure if we'll share the update of that until it's really, really close or maybe until it's done, but as of midday today, everything was going very smoothly still and that's great news. We have not ran into anything unexpected yet.

I'm holding my breath. How confident does the dev feel about the task right now? Great.

Like I said, everything's going really, really great. He's feeling great. He is super pumped to be working again and I think I've also mentioned I was super worried that all the work, you know, everything he's worked on is now lost and we're kind of just starting from square one, but that's not the case.

There's, you know, a few little details that we won't be using, but most of what he's already been working on, this is just building on it.

[Speaker 2]
I still haven't found Noman.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know what happened to him. Everyone keeps telling me it must be his visa that expired, but he was a U.S. citizen, so I'm not sure what happened.

[Speaker 2]
I really hope he's okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh my goodness, truth. Can I look at that telegram? After this task, what will be the next item before launch?

So we're, so our website, the company got sold, Epic, and there's something going on with them. I think they're going through a little bit of growing pains or transfer pains, but our website's a good one. The first thing we will release is the updated white paper.

Once task is completed, the dev will start working on the app immediately because we need the app working, and I'm assuming by launch you mean to get on War Room. Correct me if that's not the case, but that's getting the app running. That's critical to get us started because obviously without the app working, how are people gonna buy?

We need everything working smoothly and our stuff together, as Boris said, before we can move on. Not to put a time on the task, but how realistic is next Friday? I honestly have like zero clue, and I don't even want to put even like for my own self a time on it because I feel like then we'll just be disappointed.

So if everything goes, you know, so so smoothly, and we don't, the dev, by we, I mean the dev doesn't run into anything, then I think next Friday should be realistic, but again that seems like there's always something, so I will keep you updated. Also we've been like holding off on a few things like personal things till this is done, and summer's like coming to an end, so hopefully not too long. Will the dev work over the weekend at all?

He usually does. Yeah, I mean I think he's he's pretty human. I think there's some weekends where he's been completely checked out, and there's some weekends where he's actually worked all weekend.

Will this be recorded? Because right when voice started I had to hop on. Yes, I already am recording it.

We're 12 minutes 30 seconds in. After the set of changes dev is working on, will we be updated on the direction and some specifics about what comes next and what the road ahead is? Yes, that's the, so after the dev completes his work, then we'll go ahead and release an updated um roadmap and white paper.

[Speaker 2]
777. This is not 666.

[Speaker 1]
Drinking a root beer with a heavy cream. Breaking my fast. I was starving.

[Speaker 2]
I had to eat before voice.

[Speaker 1]
I'm trying to see if there's any been any like um frequently asked questions in the chats. I don't think so other than Sam just asking for there any updates every morning. Have the devs been paid yet for any tasks?

Yes. Yes, the dev has been paid several times.

[Speaker 2]
Anything else?

[Speaker 1]
We've had a few meetings this week with third parties, and those have all gone very, very well. Let's see. Thank you guys for keeping the chats pretty mild for the most part.

We're really hoping to keep them that way for for partners. Let me see. How's Velo's arm?

I'm not sure. I haven't spoken to him in a while. I think Velo is working with Finn.

That's the last I heard. So right after task the dev goes to work on the app. Correct.

Yes. The second he is done with that, we'll move on to that. So if I've been holding all this time in an external wallet, would it be zero tax to put coins then into the new app?

Oh, are you... That depends. Are you talking XT or LBANK?

Are you talking Trust Wallet or MetaMask? That's going to depend because XT and LBANK you'll pay a very minimal fee. If you are moving it from Trust Wallet or MetaMask.

You will be charged eight percent and then another eight percent. When the task is done, is that something we can use as holders or more back end and not something we can see? No, it'll it'll definitely be something you can see.

Definitely not back end.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, boy. Get a room.

[Speaker 1]
Stop pitting on Weg. He has a girlfriend. Weg has a pretty cute girlfriend, too.

I don't know how you guys get like these wives and girlfriend. Oh, MJ's wife is... I'm assuming wife is hot.

Oh, and this kid is cute. I don't think I've ever looked at your profile picture. Egg's wife is hot, too, actually, as Egg is typing.

I'm just wondering how you guys get these hot wives. That's all. Not creeping on them.

Hey, I'm glad to tell a woman she's attractive. Russell says everybody just zoomed in on MJ's profile pic. Actually, MJ's wife looks like Special Ed's wife.

Both pretty hot. Everybody thought that. And Ed G.

Ed G's wife is really hot, too. Yeah, like all of you. Maybe that's just a conservative men thing.

Because your wives are actually women. Hey, yeah, I think that's all I have. Again, I don't have a day, day or date from the dev yet.

But so far, we've not hit any snags. So hopefully it stays that way. But again, I'm holding I'm holding my breath.

So I will keep you guys updated if anything does come up. In the meantime, let me know if you all need anything. As usual, please don't share your seed phrase with anybody.

Not me, not any other admin, not me or any other admin sending you any links or asking you to send us money either. We haven't had anybody scammed for a while. I think we're on a good roll.

So just be very, very careful of that. Nobody will ask for that and nobody will send you links. If ever in doubt, ask in the general chat.

Don't DM anybody. Better safe than sorry. Because you might DM somebody pretending to be me or one of the admins.

So be very careful of that. Don't give your mom your seed phrase. Yeah, and let me know if there's anything else.

If you all need help, actually, you know what? Maybe we'll do that. We'll announce something with the XT instructions.

If you all need help moving your coins off XT, please don't hesitate to DM. But we will, I think it's better that we just post something in announcements with instructions. And then just remember, don't stress too much about the date.

As long as you contact them, they'll go ahead and let you withdraw those coins. If you have any issues, please let me know and we'll get you taken care of. But either way, and it won't cost you the 8% tax or 16% tax to transfer those coins.

All the XT and LBank wallets are whitelisted, so you don't have to worry about that. It'll be a very minimal fee. I don't want to say it's like 86,000 coins or something like that.

I'm not sure now. But yeah, you all have a wonderful night. I'll see you in the general chat and I'll post this right now in case any of you want to listen to it or didn't get on the call early enough.

All right, see you guys later!
