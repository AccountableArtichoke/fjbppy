It's Halloween, so I don't know if you all will be wanting to listen to this later. I don't know how many of you celebrate Halloween still. I don't know how many of you have little kiddos celebrating.

(0:18 - 2:45)
We don't really, so in my neighborhood, we have like a huge Halloween street, so nobody comes to like the other parts of the neighborhood. So it was kind of sad the first few years, but I don't really celebrate Halloween anymore, so now it's kind of nice because we'll just shut off the lights and keep the dogs quiet. But yeah, they shut down the street and have like food trucks and a bunch of crazy stuff the kids like, so that's nice. 

Let's see, it's been a phenomenal day. Yesterday, today's even been better. I think at this point, I'll see how the rest of the week goes, but I think at this point, we stop giving updates on time. 

But I will for sure decide on that as the week goes on. Today is the best day in a very long time, so that's great news. Huge breakthrough on the app. 

Yesterday was a huge breakthrough on everything else. Feeling great about it, minus like, I don't know, my fever or something coming back. Plus I've been up like opposite hours with the devs, so yeah, everything's going really, really great. 

I'm super excited, and I think, again, I'll know as the week goes on, but I think now's a good time to stop giving time updates. Yeah, let's see if I have any questions. I had to take a nap earlier, so I don't think I've received... Also, my dog's got COVID. 

How sad is that? Yeah, I don't have any questions. All my DMs have been everybody we're working with versus... versus any holders, I think. Let me check Discord and my emails.

(2:49 - 3:07)
Shout out to Velo, by the way, for being a huge, huge help. Okay, nothing in Discord. Let me check the emails just in case.

(3:16 - 4:29)
I do not have any questions, so I'll come back and chat. I need to change this because Coinshop Talk is showing up at the top for me. Let me see, maybe I just need to repin... Oh yeah, that's what I need to do. 

I need general to be at the top. There we go. Hi, Ed. 

Oh, I saw... what is this? Looks like communist China played progressives. I don't know. That whole Israel-Palestine argument.

(4:33 - 5:22)
Ed, I saw a meme today and I didn't... I don't know how true it is, but apparently... well, it's like a screenshot of a news article, and I don't know how true that was, or if you knew anybody that was actually experiencing this. Let me see if I can find it. It was something about like people are like losing... people are losing like their houses because of stuff they didn't comply with with COVID. 

I can't find it. I thought it was on this account, but I don't see it. Okay, oh shoot.

(5:35 - 6:16)
Oh, it looks like you guys, some of you aren't able to join till now. So the first part was we had a really amazing day today. I think by 9 a.m. My day was pretty much done by 9 a.m. because I was up so early and we had so many meetings pop up. 

Yesterday we had several meetings, but those were planned. And I think we had a huge, huge breakthrough as far as the app goes today. And then yesterday was a huge breakthrough, like major milestone as far as the task goes.

(6:17 - 9:34)
So I think depending on how this week goes, I think now would be a good time for me to stop giving timeline details. But I'll see how the rest of the week goes to just make sure there. But, and again, thanks to Velo for helping us out with that. 

Velo is officially a holder again, by the way. He's very excited to be a holder again. I think he wants to come in the chat when he gets some time. 

So make sure you are nice. Not that I doubt that you guys will be. Sorry, I wasn't reading this. 

I was checking DMs, but apparently some of you guys have trouble joining. Can you give us a rundown of what you expect this week coming? App, we should continue going strong with the app and the failed transactions. And now that we have everything we need, we are just adding major components in the app on the back end that will just prevent some of the errors that have been happening with the app for as long as we've known that. 

So that should be very, very helpful. Again, today was huge for the app. So that is great. 

We officially have more than we even need for the app. So that's great. We do have backup devs and then more backup devs in case a dev is busy or doesn't have time or disappears or something has an emergency. 

So that is wonderful. I think that's as much as I can say right now. Yesterday, everything went really well as far as meetings too. 

So that was great. I should have some updates about that very soon too. But again, kind of depending really a lot of it also depends on our task and app. 

Do we get to vote on the graphics for the final design? No, because we already have our logo. We need people to start recognizing our logo. Great idea though. 

That's awesome. Some of the events we're applying to actually already, and these are the high really more high-end events, already include a personalized tent that they all have set up for you. But we can definitely get one like that for events that don't do that.

(9:34 - 9:55)
Okay. What happened with the dev and the audit team? They're doing very well. Yes, they're doing very well as far as the review goes.

(9:55 - 10:22)
Again, yeah, I think we're close enough now that, and again, it'll depend on how this week goes, if we get any hiccups, I will keep you all updated. But I think it's close enough. Again, depending on how this week goes, hopefully nothing else comes up that we should be good.

(10:23 - 11:04)
Right now, it's looking like it will definitely be in November, unless again, we have some crazy thing come up, but this is according to the devs who are much smarter than I am. And nothing, the way the devs are working on the app now, so you all don't go using it, is they are fixing it, but not deploying anything. So, because you all seem to notice everything.

(11:08 - 11:59)
But yeah, so it will be deployed at once. I did get from the devs, for the app, I did get today that they expect to, with everything they have today, or they got today, they expect to be done now in less than 48 hours for the failed transactions and for all the other bugs by the end of the week. Again, this may change, so please always keep that in mind. 

But as far as they know, and with everything they have right now, that's the estimate. I've learned that part in the software world. Very fun stuff just always pops up.

(12:13 - 13:52)
The meeting yesterday went really well for December event and future marketing too. Is that really supposed to be him? Wow, the jawline. Wow, he either lost a ton of weight, or interesting that they even changed the hair, huh? Do you think the dev and audit work will be done this week? I think the dev will for sure be done this week. 

Yes. That's all I'll say regarding the review for now. I will update you on Friday.

(14:10 - 14:42)
Yes, that is still, uh, everything is still going in the order it was initially supposed to as far as the review goes. People were saying, wow. Yeah, I thought she was cuter than that.

(14:42 - 15:06)
But his, that's insane, because that just doesn't even look like, wow, look at that jawline. But a narcissist like that, I don't doubt it. Probably thinks he's a lot smarter than everybody else.

(15:17 - 16:55)
What else? I haven't been in the chat. I see the pop-ups of everything, but I've been so freaking busy with everybody else. If you have any other bugs in the app, or I have everything you all have mentioned before, even your ideas, but if there's anything you think of or want to share regarding adding to the app, and we're talking about either bugs or just smaller additions for the time being, feel free to DM, email, or tag me with any of those. 

Like I said, especially with bugs, if you've already reported it, we most likely have it, but it's up to you. It doesn't, I don't mind if you share that too, but if there's anything else you want to see in there, feel free to send that. I'm getting, so we have of course the list of bugs, of course we have that. 

Then we have a list of additions to be added in the next few weeks that are minor additions, and then we're getting long-term additions, much larger additions to the app. More major, nice to have ones. So if there's anything you'd like added, feel free to share that.

(17:04 - 19:52)
Okay, anything else? That sounds like everything. If you have any issues, again, please reach out, DM, email. We don't have a support that will DM you, so just be very careful of that. 

Again, please move your coins off XT. If you don't do that and XT decides that they do not want to give you your coins, unfortunately we can't do anything about that. So please keep that in mind. 

Don't move your coins. There's quite a bit of you with coins still on there, or quite a bit of coins on there, and well, quite a bit of users too. So please do get those off ASAP. 

You will not be charged the 8%, and we can help you with that. But again, nobody with a support, nobody will ask you to click on a link. Be very careful of that. 

Me and the admins will not ask you to click on a link or send us money. We don't want anybody scammed again. We will have the support page added to the website just to make that a little bit easier for you so you all don't accidentally get scammed. 

But yeah, I think that's everything for now. I think it should be a good week. Good week. 

Again, the app should be, is estimated right now, if nothing else comes up, to be completed by the end of the week as far as the failed transactions and the bugs. Everything with the devs and the reviews should also be completed by the end of the week, and everything else is going really, really well. Again, thanks Bella for the help. 

Oh, Bella's still in the chats actually. I haven't checked. I think he said he was. 

I know he doesn't get on Telegram much often anymore. Yeah, let me know if you have any other questions. In the meantime, if it is related to the app, I can't help you with that as far as like the failed transactions. 

If you've already reported to me, then I for sure have reported it to the devs and we are working on it. Other than that, and again, I mean you can always DM me. But yeah, that's where we're at now.

(19:53 - 19:59)
I think that's everything. I hope you all have a good night. Please stay safe.

(19:59 - 20:33)
I'm gonna shut my lights off and enjoy my dinner and probably have, let's see what, I'm all, I think I need to add a clock on, on like an India time clock because I'm constantly just googling India current time. 521, yeah, so sounds about right. So yeah, in a few hours I'll be pinging the devs again.

(20:36 - 20:41)
But that is all folks. Thank you so much. I'll talk to you soon.
