[Speaker 1]
Awesome, happy Tuesday. It's been a very long few days because I've had to get up super early, like extra early and actually get out of bed that early, but it's been a really great and productive to almost the end of today, two days. I do have another meeting tomorrow morning at 4.45 a.m. This is somebody in Europe. We are just getting a few quotes now to get everything wrapped up. So, super exciting. By the way, before I forget, somebody who is making cheese, can you send me your cheese recipe?

I forget who it was, I'm sorry. Very random, I know. But, all right, let's start with, oh, attorney.

So, from this point forward, you will be hearing straight from our attorney for any defamation, interference, anything like that. There will be no warning. Sorry, Moku, I'm going to mute you.

There will be no warning. This is not to protect me personally. There's people who have said all kinds of stuff about me.

It doesn't bother me. But this is to protect our holders, our community, and our future community and holders and anybody who's joining. Again, of course, if you guys are stating facts about the project, about me, that's totally fine, obviously.

However, anything that's not true, like I said, defamation or interference, you will be hearing from our attorney directly. So, please just take that into account before you spread false info or go on claiming. Again, this is to protect our holders and before we kick everything off.

That would be a great start. So, like I said, we, let me, I'm sorry, let me close my door. My bird wanted to make her fun noises.

Sorry about that. Boris is very excited. He asked yesterday morning when.

So, he is ready. Even Boris is asking when. So, that's great, but obviously, he does understand we are doing everything we can.

Obviously, many are going to associate us still with being a political entity, even though we're not FJB and we're moving away from that. But we are doing everything we can to make sure we're as bulletproof as we possibly can be with the resources we have. So, that's where we're at with there.

He is very aware of our rebranding and Patriot Pay. I'm not sure why some of you keep contacting him regarding that. Yeah.

So, that's great there. Let's see. Yesterday and this morning, we paid.

So, there was a few of the things we're getting done. We need to pay in increments. So, as certain steps are completed.

So, we had some payments I made last night and then one more, I think it was this morning. That's great. The graphics for the new merch store items should be completed by the 28th.

Well, the end of the 27th, but 28th morning. So, that is Thursday. So, that's exciting.

The reason that's exciting more than just merch, yeah, is we can finally really blast out our events just because a lot of people, excuse me, a lot of events need your actual products. So, that's cool. That's really amazing because that'll ramp that up.

Yeah. I think that's where we're at. Third party is ready to start as soon as we're ready.

So, that's excellent news. And I will let you guys know as soon as that happens. Like I said, we are in the very, very, very final stage of reviewing.

Testing is completed. Actually, I don't think I shared that yet. But we are literally just getting everything reviewed now.

We are getting everything reviewed by different entities too. So, again, just making sure we do everything we can. We are told everything there should be completed by...

Could third parties start this week? Possibly. That's a possibility.

I will know tomorrow morning after my 4.45 a.m. meeting. But we wouldn't be live unless they requested 10 days. So, I'm very, very excited.

A lot of it getting very real. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Let me see if I have any questions. I don't think I do. I'm checking.

Sometimes your messages go into a different folder.

[Speaker 3]
But I think I've been pretty good at checking that folder too.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Website is coming along beautifully. How is app fix coming along? So, we actually are onboarding somebody else to help our original dev.

Which is great news because I think I shared with you guys last time or the last maybe few times too that the dev team working on the last edition, once they complete that, they'll be moving on to the app to help our original dev with that. However, since they're still working on that and we are trying to speed things along, we are having another dev party that we are very familiar with and knows their stuff start working on that this week. So, that's awesome.

And we'll also see some with that, obviously, fixing the failed transactions. We'll see some great changes to the app to make it a lot easier than it is right now to log in to account creation, logins, and also to integrate with third parties. So, a lot going on there.

Yeah, that team will start this week. So, that's super, super exciting. I didn't realize, by the way, that even more so, I feel like, than the past few months, that most every business now runs off-telegram DMs. Is that a thing or is that just the crypto world?

[Speaker 2]
I feel like it's a lot more common now than it used to be.

[Speaker 1]
I will let you guys know, too, if we... So, one of our... I'll let you know.

I'll let you know if we may do tax-free buys up until around $6,000 worth with fiat, but I will let you guys know if we end up needing that. One of the businesses we're working with wants a different kind of payment, so we may need to do that, we may not. We may get it all figured out, but if we do need it, I will open that up, tax-free buys for fiat.

And the quote we have is around $6,000, so not a ton, but... Will the OGs get access to a presale of PatriotPay? That's a great idea.

Still looking good for first half of October. Yeah, we should be right now. So, I'm told the reviews will take a few days.

But, again, as you all know, I will keep you updated. I just want to keep our expectations kind of realistic as I'm learning in the deaf world. Jrock, are you still in Florida?

Or I should say, do you still have your license in Florida?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if that's right.

[Speaker 1]
I need some land around 38. PatriotPay, if you're interested in helping. I don't have a realtor in that area.

Is buying right now equivalent to a presale? I'm not sure what that means, but I want to say no, because I'm not sure what that means. Will Boris kick the task off, maybe voice chat?

Yeah, so Boris is working. I hate to say this, because obviously we'd like to be the number one priority, but he's likely working on something very, very, very big. Like, huge big.

But we will certainly do everything we can to get him on the voice chat. But I know you all want to hear from him. Especially going live, or at least record something for us.

But I think he has some very, very exciting, huge things coming up. Outside of us, in the real world.

[Speaker 2]
Super excited about that.

[Speaker 1]
But yes, I will do... I know they've said before they want everything complete, because obviously they want the community to be happy when they're here, but I will still try to get Boris or Bannon to join us. I know how much you all want to hear from him.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. I thought Nolan was in my neighborhood today. I just put a picture of the hot dog place, but apparently he just stopped Google.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know why I read that. In your own words. Can you run through what you think will happen this week?

[Speaker 2]
Let me see.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so we have an addition. We have a task, a mini task. I don't know, I have to be so careful with my words.

We have a dev team wrapping something up this week. They gave me a big quote. They don't know an exact date, but they're saying this week.

So that's great. And then we'll make that final payment to them. We sent the second final payment this morning.

The final payment will be made this week once that's complete. That's likely how you'll know it'll be done, but I will update you. Then tomorrow I have a really important meeting at 4.45 a.m. This will, we are just interviewing a few entities. So depending on how that goes, we're still waiting on a few appointments to be scheduled. But depending on how that goes, again, we're doing that as an extra, extra review. So we can have more than one and just make sure, again, we're going to be associated with a political project.

And we just want to make sure, you guys I'm sure see how many people are already after us and how many news articles have been out. And we are still, in retrospect, so tiny, so young, but at two years old, getting there. So we just want to make sure, again, we do everything we can.

We do not want all this time and effort and work and funding that we've spent, you guys' patience, go to waste or have to repeat anything. So, yeah, that's why we're out back. But at least that little portion complete.

Oh, also the devs getting on the app, the third, fourth dev team being added to work on that app. And we've worked with this team before. Of course, it's a problem they're trying to solve, right, the failed transactions.

But we don't expect that they would take more than a few days. Because that's what they've quoted us. Will the tax-free possibility have to be done through the app?

No. So if I do offer those tax-free buys through Fiat, just because one of the entities we are working with will only accept that as a form of payment, and it would just make a lot of things easier. If we do end up offering the tax-free payments, that will be Fiat.

So most likely, I know Zelle is how that entity wants their payments. So Zelle would be great. I mean, people have sent me checks from Canada, so really anything Fiat, anything we can get back in very easily and instantly in a bank account to pay them through Zelle is how they like to be paid.

No, but Boris just asked yesterday morning when. Boris said when. Actually, I'll read exactly what he said.

By the way, if any of you use Signal, Signal on a desktop is the best thing ever. So he asked if I could give an estimate of the time frame for when things may be ready. When, when, when, when.

How many entities are involved? As far as devs, one, two, three, four. And this is not including our advisor.

We just advised our main advisor. But yeah, one, two, three, four. Which is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

Ten devs, give or take. Actually, every one of the devs but our main dev I've met like, you know, on a Zoom Is buying right now equivalent to a pre-sale? No.

I think, if I think, if that means what I think it means. Words are hard today. Trying to get into ketosis, but I think something kicked me out.

By the way, butter is like, you know, it's been my new obsession for a few months because that's mostly what I eat now. Is region, is it anywhere like steakhouse butter? Is that a regional thing?

Because I bought some that said steakhouse butter. I just thought that's just like a generic, you know, maybe a whipped butter or something. Well, I got it and it's like, it looks red and it has red pepper and tomatoes, which I don't read.

So I've never had reddish butter at a steakhouse ever, but I figured maybe that's a regional thing. Like, is that a, I don't know, I feel like that would be like a Texas thing or maybe St. Louis. Oh, yeah, no, I did answer but that's okay.

6k per customer per day. No, their entire estimate is give or take 6k. So that's what we would need total.

Third party will be able to store as soon as current review is completed. Yes. Yes, third party is waiting on us now.

Yes, Boris knows and is aware that this is the most important part. I know I did carnivore for so long. And now I'm doing straight ketosis, which is I mean, not that much different because it's primarily animal based.

But then I do why I get into so I do like one refeed or two refeeds a week. Please be for everything. Yes, I use be to adjust.

I don't know I find it harder to eat the street versus butter, maybe that'll come with time. Got it in total. Yes, it's total.

They need, again, approximately and of course that sometimes changes to as they start working. If any hours are added any additional work comes up but right now that's they're thinking right over six grand. So, and they take, they generally want half of that to start and then the other half once it's completed so it'll be into $3,000 chunks, but we might get it figured out to.

We'll see.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's nice. I feel like I haven't seen you for a while but I do remember you for a while. Old faces coming back up.

[Speaker 1]
What I mean by presale is since anything we buy right now is going to be forked or airdropped Patriot Pay into our wallets is buying right now technically a presale Patriot Pay. Okay, so once we have a fork planned, I will keep you updated on all that and get all those questions answered. But I am very, very excited.

[Speaker 3]
Like I said, the adding time as the team added more and more functions I wasn't exactly a fan of but now that everything is wrapped up, it'll be great.

[Speaker 1]
Personally, what else am I working on? So personally, I have a few quotes to get and again, that's just because we decided that we want a few different reviews, rather than just one or two that we're already getting. So doing that this week.

Like I said, waiting on the graphics once those come in. We'll have to update everything in the merch store and put in order for the in-person events. So those will be cool.

I think we're going to start doing calls on Getter or X. I'm not sure which one would be better. I feel like Getter would be because Bannon has his crew there.

But we'll start moving to that likely before we're live just to get a hang of it. And that way, I think that'll give us a higher chance of growing. Basically, we're doing everything we possibly can to help that.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see, what else do I have this week?

[Speaker 1]
Getter, I'm banned on X. Wait, I think you just got banned. Did you just get banned yesterday?

Or no, that wasn't you. It was earlier today. I wake up so early now that I think my days are just starting to all mesh together.

It's J-Rock's birthday? Really? Is it really your birthday?

Yeah, I think that's a good idea to do that. Nice! Happy birthday!

Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
I have to get him to Discord to do that.

[Speaker 1]
What else on my end? More white paper because the team has added more. Actually, our advisor has added more functions, and I'm pretty sure it was depending on how that goes.

More additions to the white paper that I'll be working on. It's pretty good. It's a pretty good week.

I'm finally feeling productive rather than just waiting, so that feels awesome. I know it's there. I know the bot, so we kicked them out because I saw they shut down.

That was sad. But I haven't looked up to see if there's a Telegram tip bot.

[Speaker 2]
Discord still has it, though. Excuse me. Bot commands.

Got a login issue. Oops. What?

Discord's been pretty slow.

[Speaker 3]
I don't even remember how to get somebody to say something.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I don't see any other questions. I don't think Ed has any more. Trying to see if tips you see still works in Discord, though.

[Speaker 2]
Still really long. Oh, something wrong with... Is that mine?

I don't think it's mine.

[Speaker 1]
Using everything I usually use, although my internet is going down multiple times a day. There's always more. Okay, anything else?

[Speaker 2]
Probably a lot more important things to do on a Tuesday night.

[Speaker 1]
All right, I think that's everything. Cool. Oh, get your coins off to XT, please.

If you do still have coins on there, and I don't think most of you do, but if you do have coins on there, please go ahead and transfer them out to a Trust Wallet or Metamask or any other wallet you have. You will not get charged an 8% fee. I believe they charge 8,000 coins last time I checked.

But please let me know if you need any help so we can get you taken care of. But make sure you do move your coins off XT. We will be sending an email to everybody subscribed to the website to remind you.

We just don't want anybody coming back months later or a year later saying they didn't know that we would be listed. So if you know anybody that doesn't come in the chats, isn't a regular like the rest of us internet people, please make sure you let them know just in case any XT holder or any FJB holder you know of, because maybe they have coins on XT you don't know about. So just try to tell anybody you know that does hold FJB to please move their coins off there.

Again, they seem very flexible with holders getting their coins. They're not giving us a hard deadline, but I would rather not you all take that risk or lose any coins. So please do that.

Please don't reply or send any coins to me or any other admins. That's likely a scam and don't click on any weird links. Make sure when you are clicking on those browser extensions that they are the correct ones and you're not downloading weird ones and getting scammed.

It doesn't seem like we've had too many scammers in here, but I think there was a Wolverine within the last 24 hours I had to delete. So just be careful with that. If you need anything else, please tag, DM, or email me so we can get you taken care of.

I will update you if I have any updates this week. Before Friday, I will make sure to post it in announcements. Otherwise, we will see you in Discord on the voice chat on Friday.

Again, I will update you if there are any updates. I know we're still in the waiting phase, but like I said, this is the most important part and we are doing a double-triple review. So, it'll be, I think, probably the most important part to make sure that, like I said, we are just doing everything we can just to make sure all that work is worth it and that nobody tries, or anybody that does try to destroy us, does not.

All right, oh, Russ is back. Came back just to, Russ came back just to say goodnight. All right, awesome.

You all have a wonderful night. I will see you in general chat. I will post this right now along with a few notes just so you don't have to listen if you don't want to.

Have a great night.
