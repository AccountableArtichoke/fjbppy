(0:00 - 0:07)
Friday. I feel like it's already been a really long week. I hope everybody had a great weekend.

(0:07 - 1:54)
We did here in FJB World. Excuse me. Everything is still going very smoothly, thank you God. 

Phase two will commence tonight. Um, that's great news. And yeah, that's that's all I have as far as that goes. 

Um, I don't think I have any questions in my inbox unless I missed one. I just realized my Discord notifications weren't working again. I fixed them a few days ago when I, uh, deleted the app and then re-downloaded it, but I don't know why it's doing that. 

I'm having issues. Anything in Discord? And I don't think I have anything in Telegram either. Um, talk to two dev teams today. 

Talk to Boris today. Who else? To talk to our guy working on the video today. Let's see. 

That's everybody. Let's see. I think that's everyone.

(2:13 - 3:08)
Has the task been given to a third party? No, we are waiting on the devs, um, to do something tonight. They need to, uh, wrap up this last step tonight, um, on a phone call. But, um, that is planned for this week. 

That might change, but right now that's planned for this week. It'll probably be a long, long night tonight. Let's see what's coming.

(3:11 - 3:32)
6.03 a.m. That's not bad. It's weird because most other places I'm used to are, like, a whole, like, the hour difference is in whole hours, but India has a 30 minutes. It's kind of odd.

(3:36 - 4:53)
Uh, oh, the website. Oh, gosh, that's been like a mini nightmare. Uh, so it was scheduled. 

The transfer, the transfer for that specific domain took longer than usual because apparently it used to belong to someone else, but, uh, it finally, the transfer went through on Sunday after seven whole days, um, and now they're forwarding. We're waiting by tomorrow 6 a.m. Now we're giving them another 24 hours, so tomorrow 6 a.m. then hopefully it'll be working as it should, but, um, the domain host was having issues with their system, so it's nothing, nothing that we did wrong and nothing that we can do on our end other than keep bugging them. It looks like it's still re-routing. 

It was forwarding to the Romney site and they had to, wouldn't let me from my side remove the forward. It kept throwing out, like, an error message. So we'll see.

(4:59 - 5:47)
Uh, the task is completely finalized. Um, it is just the devs getting it together, exactly how it needs to be put together to send off to the third party. Um, but everything is finalized. 

How long was the chat room for? So, oh, we're going back a little bit. Let's see. 1 10, well yesterday and today, but today 1 10 p.m. to 3 24 p.m. night time, so a few hours.

(5:52 - 7:56)
Wasn't that what you told us the dev was doing on the last voice chat? Yes, that's still, uh, still what he's doing. That looks like a bird on his head. Is it a bird on his head? Okay, we have two readers. 

We are, we are adding the donations to the app. I don't know if I actually shared that with you because we had all the attorney calls last week. Uh, when do you expect the dev to actually finish the task and it be given to third party? We are shooting for this week. 

How does TPUSA look in December? So we will be there either way with a press pass, press passes. However, the booth is still pending because that very much depends on our app. Wait to spend five figures and not have the app. 

And it should, I mean, we're definitely on track to have that done, but the upcoming phase is the most complicated, and that phase is estimated about a week and a half to two weeks, but it's not a simple phase, what they're doing in there. So it's really, really, really cool. Is the dev working on this full-time or just as it pleases? We have one, two, two of the dev teams are working full-time.

(7:58 - 8:30)
How many phases are there for the app? Right now, three before it's, before the app is live for you guys. This upcoming one, that's a week and a half to two weeks, will be the last to have it ready for now. And that's, of course, that doesn't include like all the other phases after that.

(8:30 - 9:38)
That's just to have it, basically what we want to roll out, the first rollout. Will tasks be revealed before Thanksgiving? Yes, that's the goal. But we're shooting for dev to get that in this week to the third party, and then the third set to the third party after all. 

Unless you guys want to, unless you guys want to go live without the third party. Task revealed this week, we've been very patient. I would love that. 

Trust me, nobody wants this live more than I do. And I mean that. When do you think you might know if the app is good or not for TPUSA? I think, so once we go live, that may give us a little bit more insight on that too.

(9:39 - 11:23)
If there is anything, because technically we can still have the TPUSA booth with merch and gift cards, but ideally we'd like the app. So that's kind of where we're at as far as that goes. Will the new Patriot Pay website be online for traffic before go live? With task, we don't need it for task, but again it needs to be, I mean tomorrow they gave us, so I think it was around 6 a.m. would be the 24 hours. 

It's just there was a forwarding on it from whoever owned this domain before us, clearly, met Romney. So it's just that their system was throwing out errors and the errors basically were saying that we had the domain listed for sale, which we do not in their marketing. So it's just a glitch on their end. 

They've been having difficulties the past almost like week, I'd say actually. We can't evaluate going live without them. Hey, not completely in the dark. 

I'm giving you quite a bit of hints, I think. I could always summarize what the task is. That's what the video will be for, but yes, I'll definitely get on after the release of the video in case you all have questions.

(11:25 - 11:58)
But yes, the video will summarize everything in good detail, keeping it brief but simple for everybody to very easily understand. Did you get the PP merch strained out? Yes, we're going through a local printer who actually, his printing company is called Patriot. Patriot, what is it? I don't have the card right here.

(11:59 - 12:05)
Patriot Printing, I don't see. He has a pretty cool van. He's a vet.

(12:14 - 12:50)
It's weird. Where am I getting? I'm getting different. Oh, there we go. 

My screen isn't scrolling down. Task, I was going to say I'm getting different messages on my phone. Task better be good, all this build up. 

I know, it wasn't supposed to take this long. And then we ended up going back with the approval a few times. But it's very, I think we could have easily chosen to not take all the routes we did take and put the devs through all that work.

(12:51 - 13:06)
We could have easily done that, but I'm very glad we did. And you will see all those. You'll see the results for yourselves.

(13:16 - 13:32)
Define the route. The devs just have to take a lot of detours to make everything happen. Is Kash Patel involved in any way? No.

(13:32 - 15:21)
Who was it? Somebody said apparently he owns Patriot. Okay, the software. I'm not sure if that's true. 

I'm not sure we ever confirmed that. There's a task more than we can imagine. The task is sets us up, I think, for a very great future. 

And it's everything you all have mentioned and wanted throughout the months or years you've been here. Some of us have been here for a few years now. Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's been that long. 

Kind of crazy. He did own a Patriot Pay payroll company. At least he mentioned that on Wall Run years ago. 

Really? I wonder if he still does or if he sold it. Because I know what company you're talking about, but I think we've looked into it before and couldn't really verify the name. He could have always sold it. 

So it says, oh this is on where Mike Kapel founded the first Patriot software company in 1986. Patriot began providing accounting and payroll. Michael Kapel is the founder and the CEO.

(15:33 - 15:47)
Oh, it'll be super cool. And again, to make Fibodev's to, well, the dev. We have a few different at the very end, especially, to make everything happen.

(15:48 - 16:04)
And all the details. I now understand why most coins don't have all that work going to them. And you all will be the first to test it.

(16:16 - 17:37)
Oh, I'm getting DMs regarding the app. So I do want to clarify. Yes, we know so many of you are having issues with the app and Smart Wallet. 

Please keep in mind, we are working on that. That's what the devs are working on to get our app to be completely user-friendly, which includes you who are having difficulty signing into your app, whether it's the blue circle of death, whether it's not being able to access your Smart Wallet funds and transfer them, sell them, buy. That includes all the, any bugs that you've brought up to us. 

That is all included in what the devs have already completed or what they're working on next. So please keep that in mind. I can't do anything about that right now because, again, we're not deploying anything until they get that push through. 

So please keep that in mind. That is exactly what they're working on. The portion that the other dev team is working on that's scheduled to be completed by Thanksgiving will also be really, really cool.

(17:40 - 17:53)
Is Boris paying for all the dev work being done? I don't see much tax funds being used for all the dev working on our project. No, I am. And not all devs accept crypto payments.

(17:54 - 18:34)
A lot of that is through Zelle. I don't think, I don't think I've used Venmo at least any time recent. It's majorly, um, majorly our US devs who don't, um, accept crypto, but how much do you need to cut me in this part when we have the LLC? That's funny.

(18:45 - 25:56)
Yeah, I do want to, I definitely want to stress that, though, about your DMs regarding the app not working. Do get your coins off XT. Remember, if you do not get your coins off XT, there is nothing we can do for you, unfortunately. 

Once XT says it's too late, then it's too late. Also, with Wire, same thing, you all have till December 3rd, so please get any funds off of there. If you purchased coins and paid for them and did not receive the coins, then your funds are still with Wire. 

If there's anybody you know that might have coins on XT, let them know, too. That's all I'm seeing in my inbox is people having trouble with their app. But yeah, everything, I was, I was very, uh, nervous the past few days, thinking that phase two was going to take longer, but I think they did a great job. 

How often are you in conversation with Boris and Bannon? Um, Bannon hasn't been in the group chats for a while, but Boris, uh, weekly, at least. He likes his weekly updates, or if there's anything else going on, if you guys email him, then I get updates of those. Updates I usually send on Friday, probably Sunday 1. It's probably a little bit too late to send it today, but yes, Boris likes his updates. 

Not showing for our website. Has the team considered other on and off ramps with the app? Yes, absolutely. So this, um, granted, granted now, it's been, uh, that's my epic chat. 

Uh, so granted, it's been a year, what, year and a half, maybe, since, uh, April of 2022. Um, but that's when we looked into many, many, many off ramps, and I don't know if some of you remember during that time, we kept pushing the date for the app, and the reason, or one of the big reasons, um, was that we would, you know, an on, off ramper like Transac would say, yeah, we can do this, and we'd waste and pay a week or two with them, come to find out they actually don't work in half the states, um, which makes it very difficult for us. Um, so that's the issue we had before, but yes, we looked into many of them. 

Now, of course, um, that, you know, there could have been updates, um, since then, with even those same, uh, third parties that we already, you know, tried it with back then, um, like Moonpay, that was actually one of the ones, um, that didn't work in most states. I forget now, but it was like a crazy number. It's like 38, I want to say like 38 states it didn't work in. 

Um, so that's the issue there, just with the way they are integrated for our app versus the way they are for TrustWallet. I'm not a dev, so I don't know the details there, but that's why it took so long, um, for the app to actually be ready, and then finally we came across Transac, um, and they saved the day, and it's been going really well with them, um, for the most part. They're amazing, and they've actually grown a ton, too. 

Moonpay has no foreign transaction fees. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, I hate, you know, Bank of America charges the transaction, the international transaction fee. 

I'm not sure, I know Wells Fargo doesn't. Well, this is, I guess this is just here, so it could be different in other cities or states, but in Arizona, anyway, Wells Fargo doesn't. I guess it could be different for different accounts, I'm sure, too.

(25:58 - 27:37)
Um, Bank of America does for the accounts I have, anyway. But that's where we're at as far as, um, online offerings. I know Transac is doing some pretty big things, but again, um, they thought, you know, they thought that was going to be live this year, and it ended up being a lot more complicated, more of an extensive process, approval process than they had planned for. 

I'm sure they still have something that works, though. Um, will we be live this year? Yes. Oh, God. 

Unless something has to, uh, something huge has to happen for us. I mean, not to, something very, very unexpected, but, um, how many deaths we have on board, and for none of them and our advisor to have thought of it, I don't think that, would be, uh, very likely. Transac doesn't understand the U.S. wants one set of rules.

(27:37 - 28:02)
It has 50 sets of rules. I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Oh, yeah. 

Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure that, uh, played into it. Absolutely. And that's something, uh, we ran into with political donations, too.

(28:05 - 28:48)
Who's the advisor? He's, uh, anonymous. Anonymous by, uh, by the bosses. Sorry, I'm bugging the, uh, domain company on a chat.

(28:52 - 28:59)
Just DM me the answer. I won't tell unless I want to. That works.

(29:16 - 30:38)
Did you say there are three phases for app development? Uh, to start. Yes. To get it all out to you. 

There will be, we'll continue working on the app, uh, after phase three. Tonight, we, the devs, we, the devs will be completing phase two. And then phase three is estimated to take a week and a half to two weeks. 

Of course, I hope that goes quicker. However, that's the most complicated, uh, part. When do the devs expect to release app to us for testing? Uh, we're actually might vary well release at the end of phase two. 

Um, we might do that just to give everybody time to test it and find some bugs while they work on phase three. If you need to move your money, you can do that. You know, you do whatever you need to do.

(30:39 - 31:38)
End of phase two is tonight. Correct. Yes. 

Lost baby child. Don't be lost. Okay, so we have questions there.

(31:46 - 32:01)
Darn. End of phase two is tonight. Correct.

(32:04 - 32:33)
So, it's possible we could get to testing access to the app over the next few days? Yes, absolutely. Yes, depending on, yeah, I think, I don't know. Would you guys like that? As I say, depending on how close we are, if the task is taking a bit longer, then we can at least get the app released to give you guys time to test it and get some people I know just running the funds.

(32:38 - 33:05)
Very cool. I do want to clarify this phase, nothing is new yet on the app, um, fixed, um, but the phase that's scheduled around Thanksgiving will be huge and this coming phase will be huge. This won't be tonight.

(33:08 - 33:22)
Definitely this week though. Okay, cool. So, it seems like most of you actually want, want the bug fixes to go in there and do what you need to do or just play around with it.

(33:23 - 33:43)
It is, it's pretty cool. Even the, even the fixes they've done up to date are pretty cool. Um, what percentage of the app has been rebuilt? I'd have to ask either our advisor or the devs.

(33:45 - 39:14)
That's not my realm, but, and there's, I guess that also depends too if you're thinking back end or front end too, because there's a lot of things, but yeah, the front end and back end, uh, phase three will be huge for that. Phase two was mostly front end, which is changes for you guys that you will see. If Transac rejects you, how can you purchase on the app? Have you ever been able to buy from Transac? Or your bank rejects Transac? So, if your bank rejects Transac, you need to call them and sometimes you actually need to speak to two different departments. 

One's going to be a department to just let them know that it was you charging and not, you know, not somebody who stole your card. Um, but another department is going to be, if they have a second department, is going to be one where you have to tell them that you allow crypto because I think quite a bit of banks are against that. Will we get to test the new updates on the app? Um, we can, depending, we were going to wait until phase three, but it sounds like a lot of you, at least here, um, want to test ASAP so we can have the devs deploy what they currently, as of tonight, what they'll complete and wrap up tonight and have you guys test it probably by the end of the week. 

I can't imagine deploying, um, although these devs, they've been working on our app for quite a bit now, um, but they've not deployed any of the changes, um, so of course we have the information that we do from previous devs, from Velo, from Spesh, um, but that should be, if it's everything, you know, but the way Spesh explained it and Velo explained it, then it should go as planned where they push it on out and it gets pushed out to you guys immediately. You used to have called my bank and they still rejected? Hmm, yeah, that's, depending on what bank you have, you might need to speak to a different bank. Now, if your bank rejects it, there's nothing really Transact can do. 

You have to, that's with your bank. Um, if Transact rejects it, then we can, uh, we can figure that out for you and we can help you out with that. Sarah will buy back in an hour. 

I think we talked about that on the last workshop. I don't feel like I could buy from my, uh, known wallets, like, because I feel like no matter what, everybody's going to think that's when they're going live. My dad would like to try it and we'll buy more. 

Awesome. Sarah has millions. Mm-hmm. 

And Flagstar, Chase doesn't support. Oh, I remember Creative Flagstar, but yeah, I think I tried, I think I tried Chase at the time. I don't remember. 

I thought one of my Chase cards or two of my Chase cards let me, but the others didn't, but I could be wrong. Maybe it's how many times I tried. But yeah, if you guys, if you guys want to test the app and, you know, we were going to leave it until it was all, all done. 

Um, but if you guys want to test it beforehand, you can start that, that way you can find more bugs for us. I use Credit Union Bank to buy. Credit unions are the best, actually, especially for international stuff too.

(39:24 - 40:22)
Binance, Incentive Trust, what? Yeah, that's kind of, yeah, we'll definitely, I think the app, uh, and, you know, crypto, the crypto world in general, as it evolves, um, I'm sure we'll continue the, those type of changes in the app too, to add on more, on more frames. But yeah, surprisingly, so many of them, even on the back end, will say they will do XYZ, and then they actually don't. Perfect. 

We'll do that then. We'll, we'll have the devs, um, push everything. Let's see, actually, I'm down to some of them.

(40:34 - 45:13)
Uh, but yeah, we'll, everything they wrap up in, so phase one, phase two, we can deploy. Yeah, let's see if we can get it deployed by the end of the week. Give you all something to test for us. 

Hopefully not too many bugs. Okay, I don't see anybody typing, so to wrap up, um, everything, well, phase two will be completed tonight, uh, with the devs, um, also the, our other dev that's wrapping up everything for trans, um, for the third party, actually, uh, will be done, and then, uh, Transac, I will contact them regarding accounts, uh, to see if they have anything planned for the on and off ramps. Yeah, what else? I think that's all I talked about, and then see if you guys can test the app. 

I'm gonna test it, see if we can just get it deployed on our website. Last one, confirming still very likely that reveal is in November. Uh, yes, so far, um, yes, and I will update you if that's not the case, but, um, this, again, tonight, yeah, we are still very likely that the reveal is in November, but we gotta get, uh, our dev to get this turned in to, uh, the third party. 

Also, November is, um, sorry, I have stuff coming in from our website. Uh, yes, so, also, November is gonna be by Thanksgiving. We should have a different phase of the app that's been, being worked on by a different dev team, um, completed that's still on track for Thanksgiving, and our phase three with the current dev team that will be starting after they wrap up phase two tonight, um, that should also be completed within, again, we're getting an estimate of a week and a half to two weeks. 

Um, that's all, that's everything we need, and we can, again, the task does not depend on the app, you guys, we'll see, we'll see, we can, we can just have you all test it, just go release everything and have you all just test it if you want to just test it, uh, test it all. I suppose you can always, uh, just, yeah, just have you try it out, and then we can just pretty much release everything tonight if that's the case. If you all just want to test it out and just be a part of the team.

(45:13 - 48:24)
Um, okay, I'm here. Start over again. Do remember, again, to please get your coins if you have them on XT or Wire, um, I think we've, I've made like two dozen announcements now, um, we will be sending out an email if your email is on the list on our website, um, but we can't really, so please make sure. 

Great, let's go down scrolling down to, um, provide screenshots. So, anything else? All right, well, I think that's everything. If you all need anything in the meantime, please email me, um, or DM me or tag me or email Boris and I'll still get it, um, but I think that's everything we have for now. 

Again, if you guys really just want, if you're willing to just test everything, then we can just F it. We can just go live with everything and have you guys test all the bugs. Uh, I just, I just feel bad having you guys do that after waiting all this time, but hey, if that's what you want to do, then we can just throw a task in there and throw the app in there and just, you know, I guess we're, at this point, we're a pretty small family, so, um, but other than that, I'll post this and I'll post some notes for you that don't want to sit here for an hour and listen, make sure people understand, um, yeah, let me know if you need anything else. 

In the meantime, if I get any updates before Friday, which actually I will because I will update you tonight, it will probably be late, but I'll probably update you in the morning on what devs are planning of when to release the app for you guys to test. If you're just going to test it, then they can go ahead and deploy that on you guys' end, so you can do that, but yeah, we can definitely do that. If you guys want to do that, we can do that. 

Just ask and we shall receive. All right, I think that's all for now. You all have a wonderful night.
