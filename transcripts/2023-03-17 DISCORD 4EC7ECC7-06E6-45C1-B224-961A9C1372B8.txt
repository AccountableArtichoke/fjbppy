[Speaker 1]
Can you all hear me? Woo, awesome. Cool, so happy Friday.

Thank you all for joining in. Sorry it's a little late. I didn't get home till about like maybe an hour ago.

So actually less than an hour ago, but I was out of town. So thank you for your patience. I know Eastern time, we don't do daylight savings here.

So I know Eastern time, it's a little late right now. I think 8.30, right?

[Speaker 2]
Let's see, I'm pretty sure, yep.

[Speaker 1]
So we're back to three hours. I don't have any updates. I just wanted to get on in case you all had questions.

Yeah, everything's going great. Still on track to get everything done by the end of March, but you guys know how that is, especially with outside variables that we can't control. So I will keep you updated.

Even if we feel like maybe we're gonna need some time, I'll definitely let you know if that happens. Other than that, yeah, not much. In case we wanna talk about the new price action.

Yeah, I saw actually as soon as I got home, I noticed there was a buy and then somebody, who was it, was it Dallas right after? Let me go see. I think it was Dallas right after, or maybe it was Sam, who said, yay, we lost to zero.

So that's awesome. What does that mean, everything done? Everything done, what that means is the big update that we have that we will be announcing once it's live.

Because of the nature of the update, we just don't want to get it out there before it's live. So it'll be super exciting, very excited for that. I think you all will be very happy.

I don't know anybody that wouldn't be happy about this because I don't think there's anything. It includes, it's a huge package, it includes a ton of stuff, and it's a lot of what the community's been asking for. I think it'll be great.

I think everybody will be very, very happy, yeah. New advisor helping, yes, absolutely. He is amazing, so, so great, and he's been so very helpful.

All for his glory, lifting prayers for everyone. Thank you as always.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see, wow, chart looks nice.

[Speaker 1]
Is this BNB, let me see, I know BNB was, whew, BNB at 339, nice. Big Dal, why are you shushing all for his glory? Sending us prayer, we need all the prayers we need, man.

Oh, mm-hmm, when it's live, question mark, does that mean the big update will be announced by Bannon on War Room? We will definitely work out an announcement. I'm not sure if the announcement will be announced on War Room, but I will let you know.

Just don't wanna promise anything that we're not going to deliver. I'd rather be honest with you guys instead. Yeah, BNB not doing too bad.

Looks like it went up all the way to 340, almost 342. That's something to keep in mind, too, that BNB alone would bring the charts up quite a bit. What else, how's everybody doing?

It's hot as heck here already in Phoenix. And we're barely mid-March.

[Speaker 2]
Anybody get some corned beef and cabbage?

[Speaker 1]
I assume white paper update will be included, correct? Yes, absolutely, that is the goal. Yeah, we have one of the major part, major part, I guess.

The major part is the biggest one, and that one, can't wait for it to happen. Everything will kind of roll off that.

[Speaker 2]
When will I be a millionaire? Well, don't think I can answer that. What?

[Speaker 1]
Are the devs working right now on update or are the in-holding pattern? The devs are still strategizing everything. Listened to Catherine Austin Fitz.

Talked about losing Liberty to Central Bank, so Liberty Exchange or Liberty Coin, ooh. Liberty Exchange kind of sounds nice, actually. I don't know what you guys like.

I feel like Liberty Exchange goes with our logo, too. The old logo, we don't have to change it. I'm gonna make it red, that'd be kind of nice.

Sovereign Coin, mm-hmm. Oh yeah, before I forget, if anybody's having issues with Transac and your account there, please DM me your email. I know we've had a few accounts having issues, so I think they're taking care of them.

A few of them they've already taken care of and they're working, actually, let me check my inbox.

[Speaker 3]
Have I got an update?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and they're working on one more, so let me know if you have any issues, please. Has a decision already been made about the name of the app and coin? No.

It's about purchasing power, one equals house, or 30K equals gallon of milk?

[Speaker 2]
Look at that chart.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, looking nice. Looking nice on a Friday night. Has there been progress since the last voice chat regarding legal and announcement?

Yes, absolutely. Lots of variables and yeah, we've had progress with all of them. New logo, we're not sure.

We're debating, I don't know what you guys think. What do you think? New logo, keep the old one.

Have the devs made changes? No, not yet. Still being planned out.

Have Perry make a new logo? Yeah, right? So is everybody kind of thinking new logo, yes?

Just get the old out, everything of the old out? Yeah, new colors. I know, I think, I wanna say, I don't know who made it.

It may have been Tradeworthy, but I know he's the one that shared it. It had our logo with the American flag in it, which actually looks super, super clean, but BNB have made it clear they want to make this more of a global app and coin. So that's kind of the only issue there, which is the same reason we don't really wanna make it red, white, and blue either.

What are the devs waiting on? Can't say. Just know you will absolutely love it.

I don't know anybody that is not going to like the big announcement, and I don't know for what reason. I mean, I'm sure there's a few who will find a reason, but I think you all will be very happy with at least the majority of it. Ultra Suede says, yes, new logo hinges on your name.

Any talk yet since last voice chat about possible burns? Less coin equals higher possible price. I got something better for you.

Yes. Yes, but I got something better for you. You will be very, very happy.

I promise. Will the coin be front and center of the app? Yes.

Or will the app be what's pushed leaving the coin as a third cousin? I think we can do both, but no, definitely at, especially at like in real life events where we'll be a lot of our, really a lot of our target audience, because those are the people that are going to slide their card or pay 20 bucks in cash and receive that gift card, definitely be the coin. Yeah, and then as far as War Room, I think we can definitely do both.

But yeah, the coin I think will definitely stay front and center of the app. And I think even just the way we present that on the app will be a huge deal in the way that plays out. But yeah, I think we could do both because think about it in those terms where it starts being the conservative crypto app.

Then we can actually have more coins that want to be on there, get listed on there, get a percentage and whether we burn those coins that we buy with that percentage or what have you, that'd be awesome. BNB about to buy more. Hey, why not?

I mean, think about where, look at the charts right now, just with a tiny bit of bump in BNB. Now think about what happens if BNB goes back up to 600. Think that's around where we were in December, January, all time high time, right?

Let's see. I would say it was around there. December, yeah, definitely.

Is the name of the app the only name change or with the name of the actual coin and app name change and be one and the same? So the issue with changing the name of the coin is we would have to fork. That presents a big problem, right?

Because then we have the exchanges and if you want to change the name of the coin on the exchanges, they require a whole new listing fee and exchanges are expensive. I know LBank and XT at the time when we got listed were, I think one was 50K and then the other was 60K a pop. So that presents a little bit of a problem because we definitely don't want to lose the exchanges.

That's pretty valuable, right? So that's kind of the issue there. Now we can play a bit with branding.

As far as having, you know, if most of our holders are gonna be FJB coin holders from our app, there might be room to play around with that a bit to keep, you know, like FJB can be the name of the contract but the actual name of the coin can be something else as they're purchasing it on the app. If that makes sense, kind of like, you know, you go to some brick and mortar store, that name on the store is likely not the name on their paperwork, you know, whether it's LLC or what have you. So yeah, that's to be determined but that's the issue with changing the name, even forking, even if we did fork and change the name, well then the exchanges require a whole new listing fee, complete re-listing fee.

So that's the issue there, unfortunately.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Nomos says we, yay, we get to keep, fuck Joe Biden. Yeah, mm-hmm. How much tax wallet funds will the updates take?

That's to be determined and that's kind of also a reason we don't want, you know, we can't really pay 50 and 60k a pop for XT and LBank to be re-listed there with a new name. So that's kind of, if we change the ticker or the name, they want the original listing fee, which I get, because think about it, then people would just be selling their coins and to like somebody else and then changing the name. Will LBank have to buy more when they run out on their exchange?

They only have around 330 million left on exchange. Mm-hmm, interesting. Actually, not sure.

With enough volume, it will be easy to change over. It was done before. Are you talking about the name?

[Speaker 2]
Initial listing, hmm.

[Speaker 1]
On the exchanges, is that what you're talking about? I think that's what Bob's talking about.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah, the name change.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm, so I must have missed that, because I don't remember that, but it's been a long time. And we've had a lot of stuff happen. But yeah, maybe I'll DM you, because I don't remember that, and that's what the exchanges are saying, so.

Is the team confident the app can handle high traffic and transactions? Oh yeah, that's, even when we talked to Velo, I believe on the last voice chat he was at, which it's been several weeks. I think we'll have no problem with that.

Bob says, I mean, funded, oh yeah, that we funded the, of course, the listing on the exchanges, so with enough volume, we could pay for a fork and a name change. Yeah, absolutely. That's definitely something for the future.

Yeah, absolutely, of course. Sorry, I was misunderstanding you. Yeah, that, I think we'll have no issue there.

But, you know, just even rebranding the app, it goes back to actually getting accepted into events, and with retailers, and that's pretty huge. How does Bannon and Boris feel about the updates? Awesome.

They reiterated this week how much they love the gift card idea. Thanks, Bob. We got Bob and Bobby.

You guys will love my little parrot. Because apparently her old owner was Bob, so his wife would always call Bob, Bobby. It's like in a New York, New Jersey accent when she does it, it's so cute.

Will you be asking Transac to prepare increased volume with the launch? They are still slow to refill sometimes. Yes, we are hoping to reach a little bit of a solution to that whole Transac issue in the manually refilling.

So I'm hoping we get to a solution. I will share with you as soon as I hear something from them. Actually, you know what we'll do is we'll check in on that.

Yeah, it would be really cool if they just had something automated. Okay. Carrie, stop it.

You guys do have some funny legal jokes sometimes though. I've read a few good ones. We'll give you that.

What? What about instructional videos for the app? Yes.

Those will be done as soon as we get everything wrapped up. I know even community members that usually do those like Turok has made some amazing videos. Didn't want to do that until everything was kind of completed.

Okay. Still on track for quarter one. Yes, for the time being, we are.

But I'll let you know if anything changes. Decentralize everything in Telegram. Says chart is looking good.

We just need approval to move forward and implementation of the changes. I think this coin will do very well. And that's coming from a guy that's down significantly on his investment at the moment.

Yeah, I think that's most of us. Any update about the Q1 launch from Transac Off-Ramp? No, there's been no update on that except that they are waiting on licensing.

Any thoughts on CBDC competition? Oh, I don't know, what are you? Yeah, we're not waiting on the Transac Off-Ramp.

No, that's not going, that's correct. So Ed is correct. We are no longer waiting for the Transac Off-Ramp.

I know that was an issue before to get us on War Room, but as you've seen, that's no longer the case. So that's not going to hold us up anymore, Ed says, yes. Did you float the idea with BNB joining the calls when you make the announcement?

Yes, I will let you know as soon as I hear back on that. Absolutely. Tim in Telegram says chart is beyond ready for good news.

I agree. Let's see. What's going on?

[Speaker 2]
Sarah, check the DM. Let's see, oh, in Telegram. Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Wow, your DM is like way buried.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome, thank you, Ed. Thank you much. Yeah, I need, so I need to clean up Telegram because it's been doing something very strange lately and I updated my app, so I know that's not the issue.

Okay. I did finally get through my entire Discord box, though. I have a DM for you also, Sarah.

Yes, so that one, actually.

[Speaker 2]
There we go, let's see.

[Speaker 1]
After some thought, I'm leaning towards Patriot Pape. Ooh, wait, you said that sounded very American, didn't you? What changed?

Everyone wants to be American, Winston says. Sounds better when business say we kept Patriot Pape. Ah, except, why'd I say except?

Except Patriot Pape, that's true. Logo will be pee-pee. I mean, hey, look at PayPal's logo.

Patriot Pape versus Fed Pape, showdown in July. Oh, what happened to Deer Hunter guy? Oh yeah, it's been a while.

Patriot Pape keeps the non-binary away, kind of true. Let's see. Public Square.

[Speaker 2]
Super excited about Public Square, by the way.

[Speaker 1]
As soon as we get our new name, we can edit our listing with the logo and everything. Mm-hmm, yeah, I don't know. Name-wise, I know a few people were asking about it earlier today and yesterday, but I feel like we have some mixed feelings regarding the name, regarding the name.

Mm-hmm. All right, anything else? I know it's pretty late.

I don't wanna keep you all up too late. I missed the first half, so please put up the recording. Oh yes, definitely, I will.

So next week will be a big one for this community. I can't give you a time yet. You know, we're shooting still by the end of the month, but I will keep you updated.

Mm-hmm, yes, definitely getting closer. And if we do, for whatever reason, need to go beyond that, I will keep you updated, I promise. Mm-hmm, all right, cool.

Well, as usual, let me know if you have any other questions in the chats or the DMs. Yeah, I'm super, super excited. Let me know again, please, if you are having any issues with TransAck, go ahead and send me your TransAck email there. Again, as a reminder, please don't ever send your seed phrase or enter it into any shady links, anything like that.

Don't send it in a DM to me or anybody else. There has been another few Discord Sarahs, or like a Sun Devil popping up this week. I think we've had two.

So please be careful of that, definitely. To me, it seems like it's one person kind of being pretty persistent, trying to get somebody to send them a seed phrase or money. So just be careful with that.

I usually will not DM you first, but you can always go ahead and tag me in the chat to see if it's really me. But like I said, even if it is me, you really don't want to send your seed phrase to anybody, including me. Don't send anybody money either.

And just play it safe. But just a reminder there, since we have had those fake admins in Discord again this week. But yeah, let me know if you guys need anything else.

I'll be here. I'll go ahead and put up the recording right now. Yeah, thank you as usual for your patience.

Have a great night, guys.
