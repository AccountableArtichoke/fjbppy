[Speaker 2]
How is it going? FJB Drew, are you on?

[Speaker 4]
I'm here a little early. Eric, they were trying to get me to play the Pump It Up music. A little late to the party here.

Oh yeah, please. How you doing, Eric? We cannot do it without that intro.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, hang on, let me get it on here. The music has been so much fun.

[Speaker 1]
I hope everybody is as pumped as they possibly can be. It is so great to be doing another voice chat with everybody. It is always a pleasure.

I actually missed. We've been.

[Speaker 2]
Honestly, it's honestly. The delay because I had to get. As soon as I got back home, I just immediately booted this up.

Is it. You like. Well.

You. We give everybody. Can people hear me, by the way?

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Eric, I'm not sure. Yeah, you're Mike.

I'm not sure if it's me or if it's you, but I'm hearing a lot of like static and chop. Okay, one second. Let me get them on the way.

Is this better? Is this better? Yeah, that sounds better.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. It's not just sitting on the Wi-Fi. My reception has just been just even on even on my iPad.

I'm on my iPad again today and reception. I have a cellular iPad, so my reception is a little rough. And but again, so good to be doing a voice chat.

We're going to have to do a get her to live stream soon so you can all see my amazing hair. You know, I feel like that's always a treat for everybody. But again, I'm just so excited to be talking on voice with everybody again to give everybody an update of where the app is at and everything.

And to kind of give. Oh, I love. I already love the gifs on my hair, but to give everybody an update on the app, on the market, on the coin, on the project.

And I think it's an update you'll be very happy about. So I think I think grant he left for now. I think he was fix his microphone or something.

Is it do we have grant back? Grant, you're alive. Are you back?

These are so hilarious. These are so hilarious. These some of these gifs.

And also, please put your questions in the chat here as well. And then I'll answer those right after, I guess, my little spiel is done. So so the app, it looks like we're aiming for it to come out later this week.

All we have to do is is just really one more thing. So we're looking for the for the app to kind of be released later this week and for the marketing campaign to be out here to start kickoff next week. That is basically the goal.

This Apple be, I think, honestly, it's looking better than even the original. And and again, we're going through the app store approval process as well. So it's not just a web app.

Obviously, you're you're at kind of Apple and Google's mercy there, which is why we have a web app and a mobile web app. You know, with all of this, that that is that that that is, you know, again, at their mercy. But we have a great plan for that if that doesn't happen.

So but someone made a great point at shout out to crypto guy. Can we shape the marketing, take advantage of the kind of the shit crypto market and the ship stock market? I absolutely agree with you.

I was just thinking that on the plane today and I'm factoring in and improving the marketing here because crypto when I got back into it, it was all libertarians that that were all a part of it. So whenever the stock market went down, Bitcoin shot up and you saw the you know, Bitcoin was kind of basically forged into right came out 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis. So, I mean, again, I think with Biden, I honestly you know, my prediction is that the market is going to drop.

So particularly the stock market is going to drop even more so under Biden, which is why I think we're going to get a Republican back in the White House in 2024. But again, at the expense of Biden, you know, hurting a lot of people's 401ks and a lot of people's investments in kind of traditional investments. And but again, I think, you know, fortunately and unfortunately, I think this is really the best time for FGB, in my opinion.

I mean, and I'm not just saying that. I mean, it's just what what better coin than than a coin that's fucked as people's traditional investments for one case are likely, you know, actually are going down. And in my opinion, going to go down further.

I think what better coin than than fuck Joe Biden? Excuse me. Excuse me.

Freedom, jobs and business coin. And I mean, I really believe that. And I think this is there's nobody better.

There's no better moment than this. And I'm glad we had problems with that API there because it allows us to even seize that kind of initial launch to that initial launch. Obviously, we have plans for V3, V4 on this app and even future stuff where we're going to take it to even new levels on this project.

But I mean, you know, that kind of initial launch of this kind of, you know, the main problem. I mean, that that is your biggest moment to really make a splash. And then you can kind of move from there.

That's I see people are posting photos. I mean, you can move from there. And I'm so glad that we're coming up in this moment when because of Joe Biden's horrible economic policies, because of Joe Biden being weak and allowing Russia to come in and all the sanctions and everything that comes from that that affects the global market.

I mean, it's it's it's because of his actions. I mean, there's there's no better time to really get into cryptocurrency as a whole. And obviously, I'm in this part.

I'm totally biased. You know, not a better time for for FGB to succeed and do well. So and I really mean that.

I mean, it's it's I am. I was I was texting the group chat. I'm like, damn, this is this is a perfect time for a fuck Joe Biden.

I mean, freedom, jobs and business calling because of Biden's just horrible, God, awful, pure bullshit economic policies that are really hurting everyone's, you know, kind of traditional investments and causing the crypto market. And this is what happens with the crypto market. I remember people asking me, like, why?

It used to be when the stock market would go down, Bitcoin goes up. And that was back in the day. A lot of libertarians were kind of the pretty much soul community of buyers of Bitcoin and most crypto currencies.

And but then as more normal traders got into it now, it kind of mimics the traditional stock market, which, again, is why I think FGB will succeed as a technology because of all the conservative community, the people that are very aware of Biden's economic policies, you know, temporarily like you never want a short American. Right. I mean, that's the truth.

You never want a short America. I absolutely believe in in America and the American financial system to succeed. But, you know, sometimes you get a Jimmy Carter or a Joe Biden that, you know, temporarily tanks things.

And really, this is how, you know, the rich get rich. Right. Because people tend to buy in the downturn and absolutely like you see Wal-Mart, you see Kroger going up because I think a lot of these people, a lot of the smarter people that have been around for a long time, they're predicting.

I don't know if it's recession, but certainly a downturn. So Wal-Mart and Kroger are up. And this is why I think, you know, in my opinion, not financial advice, because I have to say that this is why I think FGB will do well.

And and again, in my opinion, go up is because is the same reason Wal-Mart and Kroger are going is this is a technology. Cryptocurrency is a hedge for inflation. This is a technology that is a community centered around centered around, you know, basically being against Biden's horrible economic policies.

And the goal of this cryptocurrency being something used by conservative businesses across the United States and the whole world really, you know, to be able to use and transact and accept this as their business. And this is the point of this web app, you know, is to make people easier to use this. So anyways, this is just a good lesson of, you know, see how the rich got rich and see how they get richer.

You know, I don't think Warren Buffett is panic selling right now. I think he's he's he's putting, you know, really he's moving his capital. You know, he's moving it.

He's putting his money. He's putting his money down right now. Honestly, I think, you know, the traditional stock market, in my opinion, is going to go down further.

Right. I think Biden's economic policies are going to make it worse, which is, I think, going to make things, in my opinion, like Wal-Mart and Kroger go up and also things like FGB, in my opinion, go up. I mean, it's it's true.

I mean, so anyways, I think we'll have we just have one thing. So I want to make any more guarantees. We have one more thing.

It's not even a technical thing. We have one more thing to finish on this app for it to relaunch. And while we're waiting on that one thing, you know, we're pushing the App Store and Play Store along again a little bit at their mercy on there to see if we can even match up the timing as best we can.

And then, you know, I think the marketing campaign is going to be ready next week. And again, I will keep people updated in the discord on like the timing, because, again, this is just my my my estimate of where we're at. Right.

If that one thing takes a bit longer, that was a marketing campaign. But I mean, I think, you know, it's I'm careful because I've been a part of so many crypto discords. And I would always see that the leaders of these projects make mistakes and always, you know, say things a little bit too soon because you want to please the community.

So I'm going to be always very honest with the community. And part of that honesty is I think this app is going to do really well. I think it's going to get a lot of people into it.

And I think because of Biden's inflation and Biden's horrible economic policies, taking the stock market, in my opinion, can go even worse. I think this is a good lesson to look at how the rich got particularly rich, how the rich got even richer, even after 2008, 2009, or even small little dips like in COVID. Right.

I mean, like I told people, I said, hey, I'm not I'm not giving you financial advice. You know, actually, I will even say, you know, don't, you know, say the words don't. So you don't get confused kind of in the same way you said not a flamethrower.

You know, you got like targeted. This isn't a flamethrower. Oh, well, fine.

It should out. Not a flamethrower. I was like, I made tweets.

I was like, don't buy Boeing. Don't buy Boeing. There's any stock you don't want to buy.

It's Boeing kind of saying that as a joke. Right. A little bit of reverse psychology there, because if you bought Boeing at that COVID dip, because Boeing's I mean, they're going to be kept alive for the government for the next century.

In my opinion, you know, Boeing is a very safe bet. And you never want to bet against America. You never want to bet against crypto.

You never want to get bet against Eric Finman. You never want to bet against Steve Bannon. You never want to get a bet against Boris Epstein.

You never want to bet against Grant. You never want to get a bet against this project, in my opinion. You know, I always have to say that.

It's true. It is my opinion. So anyways, it is so good to be on the chat here.

[Speaker 2]
I am pumped. I think this marketing campaign is coming. I'm glad this took a lot of downs.

And how I got richer was by buying the debt that get involved when, you know, you have a horrible president like Biden or Jimmy Carter. Nations are and do without what you will.

[Speaker 1]
So pump it up. Don't don't pump it up. Anyways, I'm a horrible singer.

So anyways, I will take your questions now and and let me know what your thoughts are. Oh, someone said. Let me see.

Let me. It's question time. It's question time.

I'm just reading the questions. Grant said, how did you get so handsome? I don't know.

I mean, I think it's sun. I think it's I think it's money. You know, I think there was a quote that I read.

I didn't say this, but there was a quote that I read. And it was if you're not you're not ugly, you're just poor. And I thought that was a very funny quote.

So that that is that that I think is true. So that's how I got so handsome was was was getting rich. I think that is the truth.

At least my girlfriend thinks so. I think I think she thinks I'm very handsome and so does Grant. So so in regards, someone asked a question of of why the original banner of FGB was moved off from the FGB site or from the or from the war rooms.

That is because we're just making room for a new banner. We didn't want to funnel. We get a lot of buyers from that and we didn't want to we want to advertise the app more so than anything.

So we're kind of waiting. They won. We're swapping it out with a new banner.

When we have this app looks like hopefully later this week. And and we want to start funneling people to there. But we don't want to start funneling kind of, you know, frankly, you know, the type of people that watch Worm are figuring out how to get into Bitcoin.

So we would lose a lot of people because they're trying to figure out our bank and all the stuff. And, you know, if you're in a crypto young, you can figure it actually even if you're young, it's our time. But, you know, the type of people that that kind of, you know, check out the worm site, you know, you lose like I don't know what the exact number is, but you lose like 95 percent just because the process.

Right. And that's why you're using this app. So we're doing a new banner.

They have told me that they're going to re add the banner once we have the new banner in the app launch and everything. And here let me look up what Boris literally just messaged me here. I want to I want to bump this up here.

I want to actually find the message. You know, I gave him an update on the app and everything. He said, awesome, awesome.

This is at four fifty three p.m. today. He said, awesome, awesome, awesome. You know, Steve is ready to push to when you're ready.

You know, and I think that that is you can obviously, you know, I'm just saying that, you know, but but at four fifty three p.m. today, this is what Boris texted me. So not to out Boris on everything on his texts, but but they are ready once we have this app and once we have this banner. So they're going to be making room for the new banner, which is exciting.

It's a much better banner. I've seen a couple options in this new app. I think it's going to even be better than the than the next version.

So. So anyways, some of the people are asking why or even better than the last version. Let me see here.

What is marketing going to look like? You'll see, because we're going to copy and paste probably the bazillion interviews that we're going to be doing in this chat. Every single one.

You know, a lot of people have been asking, you know, all this marketing campaign campaign takes work and we've done it. We put in the effort, but, you know, we want to make it so this, you know, that first splash you have allows you to get the momentum to go even bigger than that splash. But that first splash you have is really, really important in the first impression that that, you know, you have basically millions of people are going to be coming and checking this out.

Like, I mean, like when I have done similar marketing campaigns, I mean, you get 100 million. I think I think out of all when I do this type of marketing, we get always 100 million clicks. And, you know, you want to make sure that you have you can scale it right, because if you have 100 million clicks, you know, and people have and the majority of those 100 million people are people that have never bought crypto before.

And that's the goal of this app is to make it easy for people to buy crypto. You know, you're going to lose 90 million people, right? So we want to have, you know, you know, a very high conversion rate of those of those people.

So, I mean, that is basically that is basically going to look like we're going to post every single link of everything in the chat. And and I might just be I might go on and just personally saying, you know, the pump it up song over and over again. So anyways, you will see, I think you'll be pretty happy.

And and again, you'll see the links link after link clip after clip. So this is this is this is what you're going to see. And this is what you're going to like.

So I'm sorry. I'm kind of like reading between talking. Let me see any more questions.

Will there be a reannouncement on more room? Yes, absolutely. And then even pushing it, you know, you know.

Let me see. I'm just. What is the security risks?

So so basically, worst, you know, this crypto will be stored on chain. So we're not actually going to be holding your money in any way. It's all going to just be stored on chain.

So, you know, that is basically how well that that is basically the most, you know, I think there's a term in crypto, you know, not your keys, not your crypto. And and that is basically what we're going to be doing. So I'm just trying to read all the questions.

But did you buy FGB, sir? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.

Yes, sir. I did buy FGB. Fin should run for president.

Do you know how much power I'd have to give up to run for president?

[Speaker 2]
Be president.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. I'm just I'm just looking through all the questions. Give me a second.

Give me a second. When merch we will have merch up sooner than you think you think. Do you think FGB will hold up during a bear market if we are truly in one?

Absolutely. I mean, that was kind of the point of, you know, in my opinion. Absolutely.

I mean, that was the point of kind of what I was saying is, is because of Biden's what better system? I mean, even even if you're not talking about FGB coin, what better than crypto as a hedge against the stock market? Right.

But it's just, you know, there's normal people that have gotten into crypto and it's kind of left its libertarian roots where before Bitcoin would go up on the stock market would go down. Crypto was all I think is going to be doing. Some cryptos will be doing very well, in my opinion, during this, you know, I think this this Biden bear market and I think what better than a community kind of similar to how Bitcoin started, a community of right wing people, you know, backing something that is an alternative asset that can that can exist even if the whole system comes falling apart.

And so and again, what better than what better thing in the Biden bear market than fuck Joe Biden coin? I mean, sorry, Freedom Jobs and Business Coin. Let me see.

I'm reading more questions. How do we make sure non crypto savvy boomers will be guided through the process? And the new non-custodial, it'll actually be pretty easy.

I mean, what we're demoing is actually really easy. And I don't think people need videos. We'll just, you know, I think you'll have like an app through.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see here. Do you.

[Speaker 1]
So right now, right now, actually, the thing that exists today is a wallet, you know, because we connect to Metamask. So we like we did a soft little relaunch of this of this. And, you know, this is something, you know, connecting to Metamask.

That's a much more secure way in a way that you can't be deplatformed. So. So I think that is I think that is a good, good answer there.

Let me look here one second. I just. Someone said, do you think Trump will ever mention us?

Do you think Trump will ever mention FGB coin? What are the odds? I think my answer to that is never say never.

[Speaker 2]
Let me see here.

[Speaker 1]
You think you must be. What are you most excited about in the next three weeks regarding FGB? I mean, this app launch.

And I think the marketing really like like I think there's there's we have a total monopoly in the market of getting a huge community of people that are looking for financial alternatives to this, you know, this this the system. And and I think this no one is willing to has the guts and the balls to touch this market. We do.

And I think we we can have a monopoly on this market. So I think that's what I'm excited about is the app, obviously, and actually seeing it in action and start seeing some businesses and people, you know, using it and not even just using it as a potential investment. But but but actually using it.

I mean, that's always the goal. How about a weekly update every Monday? That sounds great to me.

I like that. Grant, let's do it. Grant, come back on.

Come back on. Don't leave me alone. I guess you're talking.

[Speaker 2]
There we go. Thank you, Grant. You abandoned me.

[Speaker 3]
Can you hear me on it? Yeah, I can hear you just fine. On the real.

I have a sinus infection. So I sound awful.

[Speaker 1]
But I'm here. I'm like Batman.

[Speaker 3]
I know. I feel like I sound like that. I like that, though.

I think this this project has made me forever sick. I've always been sick. I never got sick before.

[Speaker 1]
That's because how much work you put in.

[Speaker 3]
You know, it's the sleepless nights, but it's all right. It's all good. It's all good.

Yeah, I was just I was just saying this this this voice has get me pumped up. I'm going to do a voice chat this week, too. We're going to keep this thing fired up.

Yes, exactly. You're going to start this show. And then I was the sous chef.

And then and then now I'll be the star of the next show. And then you'd be the sous chef. Perfect.

[Speaker 2]
Deal. Deal. I am just I'm just reading.

Sorry, I'm just reading all the questions here. Some of these questions I've already answered. I'm like far back up.

[Speaker 1]
Someone keeps that the most important thing that this app does is to make it easy for video boomers. Do we have a video start to finish baby step to boomers? Yeah, we'll have a video.

But the goal is to make it so there's a great book and it was written by the guy who designed the original Macintosh software. And I think he's I forgot the name of the book. I think it's the design of everyday things.

Right. Like you don't want necessarily to have it be so complicated where you need a video tutorial. It should just, you know, just work.

And that is kind of the goal of what we're making it. So, you know, we will have a video, but the goal is to make it. So it just makes sense.

So that that that normal people that I haven't gotten into crypto, whether young, middle aged or old, they can figure it out without needing a video.

[Speaker 2]
But we will have a video when FGB sports team, when Trump. I like these in regards to the burn rate. I mean, we're we're just spending money.

[Speaker 1]
Development, marketing and obviously the commitments, you know, that we made in the in the smart contract. I mean, that's that's that's that's where the money is going. And I think you'll see that it's worth it once once it's out.

I mean, that's that's something I mean, I'm not I'm you know, I'm certainly not not not getting any cash here, you know. And I mean, it's you know, this is all like a mutual project. So I mean, it's it's you'll see that it's worth it.

You'll see that the effort is worth it. And I know it's some people are seeing some action in that in that wallet. But the wallet is meant to in the is meant to make this project even better and be successful for, you know, the holders as a whole.

So I think you'll you'll see it. Someone said when Finn back in Coeur d'Alene. I haven't been back in Coeur d'Alene in too long.

I want to go back. I love Coeur d'Alene. Everybody go to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

[Speaker 2]
It's amazing. Let's see here. I'm looking.

I'm looking. We're probably just going to be taking the last few questions here. So I'm just looking here.

One more text. I'm just want to look through all the questions here. I want to take my last couple of questions.

Make sure they're good. I'm just looking at everything here.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, great. I'm at the bottom of the general chat now. So in regards to some of these questions, blockchain media platform can't talk to that about that right now.

Taxes can't talk about that right now, although, you know, you'll be very happy with the fee structure in the future. But right now the taxes, you know, today as of April 9th are the same, right? So anyways, I want to wrap it up because sometimes I'm a little like kind of I'm in like a stream of consciousness reading this.

So anyways, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. It is so good to be on a voice chat with you guys.

Again, crypto is always a roller coaster. Thank you for riding it. And we're going to ride it very well into the future.

I really do think very well. One second, I got a text message. I think we'll be very well.

I think because of inflation, I think because of the Biden potential bear market, I think there's no better time for crypto. And I think FJB coin, this is its time to shine. This is its time to do well.

This is its time, especially with this app relaunch. I think this is its time to absolutely succeed and do better as a technology than it has ever done before. And I believe in it.

I'm excited for it. I'm pumped for it. I mean, with Grant here, how could you not?

With Steve Bannon and Boris, how could you not? With this amazing community, how could you not? Thank you, everybody.

It is my pleasure. We will beat the Biden bear market with cryptocurrency. Thank you so much.

Goodbye.
