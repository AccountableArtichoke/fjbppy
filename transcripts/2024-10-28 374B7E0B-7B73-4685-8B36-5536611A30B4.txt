Is there redundancy with off-ramp providers? Is Transac the only provider? I'm not sure about this.

I'm sorry, I will check. This is not my area. Not sure whether to answer this with app or marketing.

But, video tutorials or website? KYC, BNB... Okay, so this person is just asking about video tutorials for the website.

To do the KYC, to do the BNB buys, or the direct buys. Maybe someone here could do it and forward it onto the team if they are that hard up. Yeah, if somebody wants to make those, I'd be more than happy to post them.

I can also... Hello? Sorry.

I can also... Stop it. I can also get...

I mean, we can hire somebody to get those done. I don't think that would be a big deal. If that would help.

As far as marketing, are the midterms even a factor in what FJB might do? Or is it just waiting until the app is perfect and then go? I honestly think they are beyond busy right now with midterms.

So I don't... I really don't think we'll have any War Room marketing. Yeah, I don't...

I really think they are so, so busy with midterms. And rightfully so. I know it's frustrating.

I'm right there with you. I want them nothing more than to get us on War Room. But in the big picture, I also realized how big these midterms are.

So I know that's super frustrating. But B&B are looking at this as a very, very long-term project. Versus, you know, something we need to get out there and pump ASAP.

So I think that's something to keep in mind. And I think that also has a lot to do with why the name was changed from the original FJB. I think that's all the questions I've gotten.

I know I got one for Velo. And let me see if I got an answer back. Okay, so I got this question.

The user interface in the app still appears to be mostly weird. Or mostly wired. Sorry.

To work with the old API from April 18th. When will the UI be updated to properly show orders relayed through ChangeNow and TransAck? Also, will there be some form of error reporting to show the status of the TransAck ChangeNow transactions through the UI?

So the user knows if the transaction went through. Velo said this is exactly what's in that plan. So I believe this will be worked on.

And I think that's all the questions I had. Just got in here. Can you start over?

Yeah, I actually forgot to put my record button on until a few minutes ago. So I'll do a quick run through. Yeah, I know.

Well, I'm actually going to do it just in case. Or I might do a written announcement. But just our updates.

Transferring accounts. A few things proposed to B&B that I think they'll be very happy about. Gosh, I'm sorry.

And possibly a new channel I think would be a good idea for everybody kind of like the old cabinet. But everybody being invited in there if they'd like. So I think that's everything.

We're hoping to get those items approved that we've sent over. So, yeah, let me know if you have any other questions. Feel free to DM me.

Okay, somebody just sent me a DM. Is Ryan still involved? Yes.

And in the beginning, Bannon and Boris did a press conference and announced Sergeant Gunnery and others to the FJB team. Are they still involved, and if so, in what capacity? Yes, they will be involved once we're doing full marketing.

Those same people and influencers we had are still on board. If that changes, I'll definitely let you know. Do we have anything planned to try and capitalize on midterms?

I'm hoping to get approved some just grassroots marketing versus the big marketing plans they have. And I'm really hoping to get that approved as soon as I can. I know it's a little disappointing, but we've just had a lot of changes here.

And I promise I'm doing the best I can, trying to just go in a different direction now and do the best we can. I think we've had a very productive week behind the scenes. I can't wait to share the updates we have from that.

Again, I think everybody will be very pleased and very happy. I do hear you. And making the community happy is one of my biggest priorities, and I truly do mean that.

I am listening to all the suggestions that come in. I am listening to everything that you mention in the general chat. I know we joke about a lot of it being whether it's FUD or what have you.

But I really do take all this into consideration, and it's one of the biggest factors when I'm bringing all this up to the B&B team. Of course, we want new buyers, but if the current community isn't happy, what good is that? So, is Special Ed still involved?

No. Special Ed, I believe, is a holder still. Other than that, no, he is not involved.

He hasn't been involved for quite a while. I think that's all the DMs I got. Okay, thank you.

I don't think... Could you follow up on the four to six weeks, get back with us? Yes, I'm hoping once it's daytime there, they can get back to me with a transact.

And I will update you on that. I still have not forgotten about the other questions from the previous two voices here in Telegram that I wasn't able to answer. I do have a list of those running, and I will update you as soon as I can.

I do appreciate your patience. I know I've been a little MIA here, but we've been getting a lot done behind the scenes. Again, I'm hoping for the best with that.

And I really can't wait to share with you all that and what gets approved. I think we'll start voting maybe on a few things too as a community to get everybody involved. And get your opinion, because at the end of the day, without you, there's not a coin.

And there's not a community. So, that being said, I think that's everything. Yeah, 17 cents by Christmas.

I don't know. I'm not giving dates or numbers. Not my area.

Wait, I had another DM. Nope. Okay, just a thank you.

Alright, thank you again. You guys have a great night.
