(0:00 - 1:23)
All right, uh, happy Tuesday. Uh, sorry for the short notice. I was waiting on a few calls, so I didn't know how early or late they would come. 

Um, but it's been yesterday or last week ended off great. This weekend was, sorry, hold on, I think there's somebody I need to mute. Um, this weekend was great and today has been awesome. 

Uh, I think this week will be a very eventful week, um, depending on, so we had to make, we had to make a few contract changes. I think I updated you on that a little bit on Friday, uh, and that's why we haven't been testing with the community. We think we've got everything we needed from you guys. 

Um, we'll still have some changes, um, that we'll make, more like additions, I guess, to the contract. Um, but that does not, us going live doesn't depend on that. That's something, you know, we can add those additions whenever we'd like.

(1:23 - 3:24)
So that's great and that's a great feature of our contract. Um, awesome, awesome feature that we can do that, um, add and subtract from the contract. Uh, so that's definitely a super, super cool feature that I hope everybody really, like, recognizes. 

It was a lot of work to get that added on. Um, but the, what we've added to the contract this, the last few days and today is everything we need, uh, so far for change now. Um, they just had, you know, we tried, we couldn't, it was really to protect you guys. 

Um, we don't, they need to test with higher limits, but anytime we brought up the limits, somebody would try to sneak in there, um, and trade on their own. So now trading has been disabled for all of you. Uh, and yeah, change now is doing their thing. 

I think I updated you already. Uh, Transact is done. So we expect, uh, again, change now. 

Yesterday said 24 hours, but then we had, you know, we had to make this change in addition to the contract. So, uh, we're hoping by tomorrow morning they, they're on a different, different time zone for the most part. Uh, we were up pretty late or early last night. 

Um, but, uh, yeah, that's great news. So, uh, that's all I have as far as that goes. Everything else is going really well and as planned, uh, let's see, depending, uh, I don't think I have any questions or anything in my DMs.

(3:34 - 7:42)
Yeah, I don't see anything. I just checked my email a few minutes ago. Oh, my meeting, uh, yesterday morning went amazing, better, so much better than we ever expected. 

I mean, we expected it to go well, but, um, a lot of unexpected, um, really great things came out of that meeting. So that's, uh, super exciting. And that was, uh, mainly related to the app and some new features in there with a new partner, um, that'll be, uh, pretty necessary and huge for us, I think, definitely for growing the community. 

So, um, yeah, we'll share that with you. Basically what that portion is also waiting on is waiting on change now, uh, so we can go ahead and test to, now we have two editions, uh, basically on backorder on the app. We have, uh, obviously the Patriot Pay integration, um, and we have not, uh, pushed that through yet to you guys. 

We'll test it on our side before doing so. And then now we have a second, what our dev, uh, finished up last week. Um, and that was more to do with, uh, the meeting yesterday. 

So, um, again, great company, uh, that, yeah, that'll, I think you all will be very, very, uh, excited for that. But yeah, I don't think, I don't think I have anything else unless you all have any questions. Let me see. 

So, airdrop this week. I cannot answer that until change now is done, but I do have a good feeling about this week. Is this a question? I thought it was a few of you, but I think it's just Matt typing, so I'll wait for him. 

Since Ed's not here, oh, Ed isn't. Uh, since Ed's not here, what do you see for the next week? Um, like I said, I have, with all the changes we've made, uh, to the contract, unless change now has difficulties testing, which so far they have not, um, we shouldn't need to make any more contract modifications or none, at least none that are going live, depends on, uh, of course, we'll continue adding to the contract just because, uh, yeah, we keep adding new features, um, but that, uh, is independent of the airdrop or us going live. So, if change now completes everything, um, then we should be airdropping within the 24 hours, and we'll make the announcement and give you guys 24 hours to, uh, prepare.

(7:44 - 8:54)
Maybe drop the video with the airdrop and then give you guys, uh, 24 hours to prepare before we enable trading for everyone without, well, there's still a limit, but with a very, very high limit if anybody else wants to buy. How soon till we get to see white paper after airdrop? Uh, it'll be the same week. We were planning within the day, uh, but with the addition we've made, uh, that the dev completed last week, uh, to do with yesterday morning's meeting, there will be some more changes that need to, uh, take place there to get that white paper updated.

(8:58 - 10:04)
I came in here late, so no more community testing other than the app? Um, not right now. We don't need anything else from you guys. We have a solution, uh, for everything so far. 

Yeah, if we, if we, if change now has issues or, um, you know, something else pops up, we will definitely let you guys know, but yeah, our dev has that under control and we know exactly, uh, our dev knows exactly what he needs to do, which is why trading has been disabled. A video at airdrop? We can probably do that with the 20 per hour notice. Might be a good idea.

(10:14 - 12:06)
Well, cool. I think that is everything then. I don't, whoops, sorry, let me see if I have anything on Discord. 

Don't think I do. Uh, yeah, I think that's everything. Sorry, I've been a little quiet in the chat. 

It's a lot going on back here. Um, I think we're at the finish line, which I am very excited for, but in the meantime, if you all need anything, you know where to reach me. Um, again, be very wary of, please just follow directions. 

Don't install or download any quick swap app. I'm not sure if that's still available for download, but it is a scammer app. Um, yeah, don't share your information. 

Remember, neither me or any other mods will DM you first. But always just ask in the chats. I feel like we haven't had anybody in a few weeks, so it's getting to that time. 

Um, but yeah, if you're ever in doubt, just ask in the chats so we can all confirm for you. Uh, yeah. Let me know if you need anything else in the meantime, but, uh, so far so good. 

If that changes, um, and I don't feel like this week is gonna be a, uh, the week, then I will update you. Um, but again, I think, uh, change now, and they've, they've been good to us. They definitely have made up for, they've taken longer than expected, but they have made up, um, compensation-wise to us.

(12:06 - 12:48)
Uh, so that's been great, which of course, uh, our tax money is a percentage of all the year transactions, so, um, yeah, they have, they have, uh, been very generous with us. So that makes up for, uh, again, and it's, it really comes down to our contract being more complex than your typical contract, so that's why they're having a more difficult time with it. Uh, so we do appreciate that, and I think there's something to be said about that, too.

(12:48 - 13:12)
Uh, I think that's a good thing. So, uh, again, if that changes and they need any more time or any more modifications, I will keep you all updated, um, but so far, we're looking good for this week. All right, if you need anything else, uh, let me know.

(13:17 - 13:58)
Will real-time price, hold on, sorry, I get really distracted when somebody isn't needed and there's the sound in my ear. Oh, um, will real-time pricing work in TrustWallet or does that require a full listing on, um, I'm not sure, I'll double check on that, but our, uh, CMC listing is in progress, so actually, I should probably check on that. I don't think they've emailed for a few days.

(13:59 - 15:24)
Uh, why is it more complicated? Uh, because we have a more complex contract. Uh, all right, DM me if you need anything else, or text, or call, or email, um, or don't show up in my house, um, but, it's complex because it's, oh, well, one, we have a proxy, and two, we have a lot of functions that your typical contract doesn't have that wouldn't impact their testing, like our pre-treater function. Um, okay, I think that's everything. 

I am gonna get back to work. You all, you guys have a good night.
