[Speaker 1]
Happy Tuesday. I hope everybody's doing well and having a great week so far. Got the recorder going in case you need to listen to it later.

I have some great news. So, Dev has completed testing. The team is now testing and reviewing the code.

So, we'll let you know how that goes. We just want to make sure everything is working as intended. Again, the devs spent a ton of time thoroughly testing.

Definitely took more than expected, but we want to get it done right. And I will keep you guys updated on everything we're testing. Super exciting.

Definitely a relief. Um, yeah. I have to send Boris an update tonight.

But other than that... So, what happens after the team reviews everything and testing goes as expected, which is not going to take as long as the dev has, I want to be clear of that. We just want to test all the features and make sure, you know, just in case something was missed or miscommunication or what have you.

And once that happens, then we let third parties know. And as far as we know so far, the times they've quoted us have been days. Like a few days.

So, as long as that goes as expected, right now I feel confident we will be done by the end of the month. But I will update you if that changes. That's just, you know, as of the most up-to-date information we have and expecting everything goes as expected.

So, beautiful. Let's see. I don't think I got any questions in my DMs. Did testing go well with third party?

So, we want to make sure everything is good on our end before we give them the green light. Is the coding done for other features? All coding from our side is complete.

Again, unless testing tonight, tomorrow doesn't go as expected, then there'll be some changes. Is the project staying with PatriotPay as a name? Yes, so far.

When will the Telegram PatriotPay channel be active? So, that will wait just because we definitely want, we don't want the conversations, some of the conversations that happen in here to be in those channels. So, that'll be, basically we have a completely different goal for those channels.

But in the next few weeks, again if testing goes as expected from our end, in the next few weeks you should expect to see, as of now, you should expect to see the logo, the PatriotPay websites, and everything else. Roadmap, white paper, yeah. And then including the Telegram and Discord.

So, super excited about that. Noticed some buys over the weekend. Were there some interesting transactions which included coins being sent to the burn wallet?

Are you able to discuss with this testing? No. The coins, so we reviewed that yesterday.

The coins being sent to that burn wallet is definitely not management or the dev. So, yeah, I'm not sure which one of y'all is doing that, but it's definitely not us. So, I'm not sure, gotta keep searching for answers on that.

Maybe somebody felt like doing something nice for you all, for the rest of the holders, I'm not sure. Is the team hiring for any additional positions? Not right now.

Is the PatriotPay website being built at the moment? No. So, we are waiting until we have completed everything with this task.

Where's garlic and noodles? I remember noodles, but I don't remember garlic noodles.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. What else?

[Speaker 1]
I think that's all I got for you guys. I don't see any questions in my Discord, I don't think. At what point will the team pour gas on the marketing?

So, we'll kick off marketing once our app is functional, right? There's no use to spend any funding on marketing, or even the energy, even as far as Bannon kicking it off, if there's no way. Or not no way, but, you know, we're talking, the typical conservative watching War Room probably is not familiar with TrustWallet or LBank.

So, once that is complete, so first, you know, the task, then we have our app. We've got to get that to be functional, very user-friendly, and super easy for somebody like my mom to download that and easily buy in, even if it's 20, 30, 40 bucks. That's interesting, is those burn transactions were all part of one buying transaction from Paypal?

Yeah, that's not anything on our end. I have double and triple checked with the dev, too. Will dev go to app now, or are we still waiting for the task?

No, he is, he has to get everything completed with the third parties. Assuming we start intaking thousands or millions of new users in the near future, what is the support plan? Is there a support team on standby ready to help onboard new users, help them with a general functionality, thinking Coinbase support, for example?

So, we'll get to this, obviously, once our app is functional, I'm assuming that's what you're referring to. And, yeah, I'm always available, we will always hire support if we need that. I know on Fire Day, we got slammed, but we were able to handle it.

So, yeah, of course, if we need support, and if we get to that, or when we get to that point, I hope, and I can't handle it, then we will handle other people to help with that. The goal is for our app to be so user-friendly that that is limited, of course, but like I said, I mean, when we, that day, the first day, Bannon started marketing us on the Wire Day, we were getting support tickets, gosh, I don't, I couldn't tell you how often now, I don't really remember, but I was able to keep up with them. How many third parties?

I think I answered this last time saying under seven. Can't be too specific. Oh, who's complaining in Discord?

I don't know why some of you keep making new alt accounts. Just come in under your, you know, under your known account. We love you for who you are.

Having a coffee at 440. Okay. Anything else?

So, it's more than two, yes, definitely more than two third parties. Yes, sir. Oh, what's that?

How's everybody doing? I saw we had somebody from, like, a Nigerian prince. Who was that?

Whose alt was that? Muhammad.

[Speaker 2]
Anything else?

[Speaker 1]
But Sarah, even a relatively easy interface like Coinbase has a full-blown dedicated support team. If we get hundreds of thousands or millions of new users, won't we need a scalable support group? Yes, that's exactly what I said.

If, when we need that, we will hire more people as we need them. Seems like it would be too much for one person. Yep, that's what I said.

If it becomes too much for me, that's where we will hire people. You are correct. Gosh.

You guys. Alright. How has TPUSA gone?

I have that call on Thursday. What's today? Tuesday.

So, a few days. I did almost have a heart attack yesterday because I was discussing something with one of our third parties, and they quoted us a very large bill for something, and then they backtracked, so. Any chance Team has finished reviewing by Friday?

So, I literally just got everything from the dev, and it shouldn't take longer than Friday, unless something's wrong. But I have faith that our dev crossed his T's, dotted his I's, but yes. If I had to give an answer, I think for sure we will be done.

The team will be done reviewing the code and testing some features. Super excited to do that. I'll do Rose.

I'll be doing that myself for the rest of the evening. Super excited about that. How many people is the team currently, and what are the roles?

We have Bannon, Boris, we have the dev, we have an advisor, we have me, we have an amazing person who runs social media, we have an amazing person who runs a website, and then we have one, two, three. We have two, three, four advisors, and, oh, sorry, I thought I sent you. Hold on.

Trying to send an invite back to you, doodoo child. And then our awesome admins. How many people does a typical team meeting on Zoom consist of?

Zoom is usually me, because that's usually where we have our meetings with third parties. That's usually me and whatever third party we're dealing with. What did Rose get you for?

Rose is nice, though. She's quick. So all intended features have tested and working well.

Yes. As of last night, this morning. Super excited about that, and we'll obviously discuss more once everything is live.

[Speaker 2]
But I am very, very excited about that.

[Speaker 1]
High fees are eliminated, then. Yes. Yes, our dev worked.

Actually, that probably took the last week from him to optimize fees and make sure that several of these features don't cost you all an arm and a leg. So no more 8% tax. No.

Tax is definitely staying. You cannot expect to grow without tax. It costs to run everything.

It costs to grow. It costs to market. It costs to get the app functional.

Everything costs, as I think most of you know. But people won't buy this and use it with 8% in and 8% out. You bought it, and many others did.

And a ton of people bought it on Wire Day. Have we been told what the massive task reveal is? We will, as soon as it's live.

Oh, I forget. Sam isn't usually listening to this. Sorry, I should have typed that.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, gosh.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, boy. All right. I'm excited to test out these features myself.

Super excited to that. Yeah. I will let you know how it goes.

I'm hoping. I don't have a doubt that it's as simple as we're thinking. But I'll definitely update you on me testing it, too.

Testing out the cool features. Let me know if you guys have any questions or need anything. Feel free to DM me or tag me.

As always, please don't send your seed phrase, your keys, or send money to any admins or anybody pretending to be an admin. We will never ask you for money or for your keys or seed phrase if you need help. If ever in doubt, I know just, what was it, like a week ago last week, maybe, or the week before, there was a fake JB and somebody posted the screenshot in general chat.

So we got asked if that was actually JB. So please do that instead of sending money or clicking on any weird links. Just be careful with that.

We haven't had anybody scammed out of their coins for a while, so let's keep it that way. Don't give them to your mom. Don't give your keys to your mom.

We are getting DMs from people in this group. Oh, what kind of DMs? Hopefully nobody asking you for money.

Christine, do you have a last name? I'm sure there's, let's see, I'm sure there's, maybe not. I mean, we have 2,300 people now, huh?

I was going to say I'm sure there's more than one Christine, but let's see. Christine Smith, is that it? She's in McNifty too, though.

I wonder if that's her. Send me a screenshot if you don't mind, just so I can make sure it's the same person. Doesn't end up being a poor holder.

89-year-old lady living in Georgia or something. Oh, we blocked her. Okay, I'll try messaging her.

Let's see. Thank you for letting me know, though. What was she doing, asking you for your seed phrase?

Or to send her money.

[Speaker 2]
Agreed. Oh, Christine.

[Speaker 1]
She wants you to, oh, she did, her bio says we rise by lifting others, so possibly her.

[Speaker 2]
Nice. Let's remove Christine, just in case.

[Speaker 1]
Hopefully that's really her. Alright. Has the team talked about timing this?

Shoot, I thought I was responding. Has the team talked about timing this project for an election season run-up? Yep, I think we're on track.

Alright, well, I think that's everything. I'm going to finish my coffee and start testing. I will let you guys know how that goes.

If anything else, again, tag or DM me. I will get this posted in case you're listening to it later. And hopefully I have another update for you guys before Friday.

But I'll keep you updated as usual with anything I do have. You all have a great night. I'll talk to you in Jen.
