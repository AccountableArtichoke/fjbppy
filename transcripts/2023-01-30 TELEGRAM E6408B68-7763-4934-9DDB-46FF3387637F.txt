[Speaker 1]
So yes, please do not ever give anybody, you know, I know it's happened a few times when people are just having an off day. I think the last person that happened to that I knew of in here was like, had their, when they had COVID, the one last night. I mean, I get it.

We all fuck up, right? But I'm really sorry about that. I know it tanked the price.

Hmm, you can't hear me, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see, let's see if his volume is up.

[Speaker 1]
Can you hear me now? Trying to like mute and unmute. That's weird, I wonder if your speakers, let's see.

Okay, I wonder if Heath's speakers aren't up. That's weird, awesome. Thank you, we the people.

Thank you for all the work you do. Okay, awesome. So yeah, Heath will let us know, hopefully that works.

But yes, very unfortunate, no problem. We'll get through it. Like, I don't know, like saying it, but then realizing I have to type it cause he's not hearing.

Okay, we'll wait to hear that. Oh, awesome, cool, Heath, cool. So, all right, back to last night.

Very unfortunate, we'll get through it. We have had almost $20,000 in sales from the marketing wallet today. And there's two pending, I believe, that I just need to, one wants to pay, I believe through Venmo or a card.

And then another one, I believe he's already just sent it during the like last few minutes while I've been off trying to cook my dinner. But, so, where's the charity money going? Any way to show receipts?

Yep, you can follow the marketing wallet address on, I didn't post the link, but so far it hasn't gone anywhere. It's just, you know, I send them FJB, they send me USDT or BNB to kind of break it up in case, you know, BNB goes to crap, then FJB's not stuck with any funds. I've already reached out to our devs and we're also looking to onboard new devs today.

I have not heard back yet. A few of them were recommendations from you guys too, but that's awesome. Oh, yes, going to pay devs.

We need our app working. No hookers and blow, no loser scammy face. Yes, absolutely.

I am very, very excited. Second one, yeah, it's more fun. You do that once we're back up.

But yes, very excited about that. We are this week still waiting on a call. I was told it should be midweek, but I'll keep you updated on that, on the call with the attorney, and then hopefully that'll give us a solid update as far as the LP and any other updates we need, trying to get something solidified again with BNB for the year just so we're no longer in this limbo so we can kind of move on and get past the stage like we discussed on Friday about kind of, I wouldn't say rebranding.

We're still Freedom Jobs business, but we really need to just go a different direction because we are just getting denied left and right, understandably so. You know, business is business, and even conservatives don't really wanna be associated, conservative businesses don't wanna be associated with FJB more, you know, pro what we are versus that, even though I'm sure most of them still believe FJB. So, that's that.

Let's see, what else? If your app is not showing prices, that's still across the board. Like I said, our wallets are pretty much paused from making any sort of payments right now.

Yeah, as far as that goes, but we will get it squared away, and again, we're trying to get the devs back on board as soon as possible now that we have funds. We're like rich now. FJB is.

Other than that, yeah, I just really want you all to be careful not to share your seed phrase with anybody, not even with me, not with any admins, not with, you know, nobody is ever gonna need that. Nobody will ever need that for you for any kind of support, doesn't matter what it is. I know we've repeated that over and over, and I know we all do, you know, we all have off days, so I feel terrible, I feel awful for what it did to the charts, but we will get through this with you guys.

I mean, that's really the strongest part, and that's the only reason that we are still where we are, I think, is you guys. This is why, you know, so many crypto projects, I'd say most of them, just die out, and why we're still here. Thanks to you.

As far as questions, I don't think I received any, to be honest. Let me see. But yeah, I haven't received just a bunch of requests to buy from Marketing Wallet, but let me know of any questions you have.

Um, I did talk to the team Saturday, and again today. Yes, like Heath's saying, check who you're in a DM with, because the admins will never text you first, ever. So if you get a message from me after you ask for help in the main chat, or from Heath, or from Paradox, that is very, very, very likely that it's not one of us.

So go ahead, if you're ever, you know, unsure, just ask in the chats, or just tag us. Tag us, or DM us straight away. That way, we know.

And yes, you should be able to see common groups. Sometimes they are in the group, but you know, sometimes, or a lot of times, they're not, because they don't want us to ban them. Um, excuse me, that made a lot more sound than I wanted it to, because I made a margarita.

Is Bannon going to add political donations in the FJB app? Getter post from Grace says, him saying, program, don't give to RNC, saying program. Hmm, don't give to RNC, what do you mean?

I didn't, sorry, I think I'm not reading that correctly. Okay, him saying, program, don't give to RNC. We can, I say that's a great idea.

I said that when you guys mentioned it. I think we should 100% do that in FJB. No, no, I think that's the only, that's the only way John Anthony will support us again, though, that might work.

Let's see, let's watch this. There's a lot of talk about RNC, I understand you guys are so hooked up, whatever you do, don't send them any money. Oh, I haven't seen this.

Interesting, what is it? Huh. What?

What the heck, three hours ago? Yeah, I'm sorry, I missed that. It's been a very, very busy work day.

But no, honestly, I've not heard of that. But I do think that's a great idea. I was on board before when you guys mentioned it.

Let's see, some DMs, but I don't think questions. Need candidates, mullet, set up an ad, it will be right under other coins, and you click and say, yeah, I think that's a brilliant idea. And we can get started on that.

I think that should be a pretty high-priority item. I feel like we should get started on that as soon as we have the app, I don't wanna say completed, because I know we're always gonna have, but functioning as it should. How soon will the marketing wallet, today.

I messaged two devs today, have not heard back. It's been a very, very busy day. But yeah, if somebody had gotten back to me, it would have been like now, we have the funds now.

And we're not using them on hookers and blow. Transact not working on the app, hmm. What are you trying to do, GoTruckers?

Are you trying to buy? I can ask them what's going on.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. Okay, let's see over here.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, are you getting an error message? Can you tell me what's happening, please? Because I just notified them.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm, let's see. Hmm, okay.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder if that was just a glitch. GoTruckers, I wonder if we should try again, maybe? Yeah, like Heath is saying.

Is there any talk about integrating the smart wallet and original wallet? Or do they have to be two separate wallets? That's a question for Velo.

To be honest with you. But yeah, we can check on that. Is the defined loan still needed or can it be locked out?

I'm not sure, I honestly don't know because I don't know what the heck is going on with the app or why it's not working. But I think, I mean, we should have plenty. And by the way, BNB's wallets are still locked too.

Hmm, I'm still having trouble, that's very strange. Yeah, I'm not sure. I'll let you know, GoTruckers, on why that's, I'm not sure if that's a Transact issue or an app issue, but I did already contact Transact, so I'm waiting to hear back from them.

They'll usually reply different hours since they're across the world. Oh, I've never tried Apple Pay. Can we get some devs from the other apps, aka HimalayaCoin, to work on FJB?

Hey, that would be nice. Hmm, I wonder if it is your bank. I mean, sometimes that does happen, even if they've approved you before.

I don't know my bank did that. If you buy too much. Did everybody hear we've had almost $20,000 in FJB marketing purchases today, marketing wallet purchases?

I feel like I'm being very loud. I'm sorry, I'm grossing anybody out. Okay.

I'll definitely, yeah, I'll definitely let you know, GoTruckers, as soon as I hear back from Transact. Because it could be, I know yesterday or the day before, they said they're still going through a lot of testing. So it could very well be them.

Does all the marketing wallet purchases go to development? I mean, it has for quite a while. I guess.

Well, I guess bills too. I still need to get paid back for the bills I'm paying, which is to keep the website up, to keep the app up. A lot more accounts than I thought there would be.

Lemon drop. Oh yeah. Z Money, I read your DM.

Sorry, I've just been literally slammed. I've actually spent pretty much all day on my computer today. And a few days of last week, but just behind the scenes reading what you guys are all saying.

So yeah. May so soon. Moving forward, should we buy FJB in Smart Wallet or Expo Mode?

Is there a preference? No, that's really up to you. Yeah, so in Smart Wallet, it's gonna cost a bit more.

I mean, very. Really, I don't know if it even counts. I don't know like a certain percentage to give you.

But yeah, it just kind of depends. Because they are two different wallets. So be aware that they are two different wallets, right?

So don't freak out if one doesn't show the balance of the other. But yeah, it's totally up to you if you want to have gas or if you want the Smart Wallet to do it for you. Pierre says, is the gift card feature fully paid for?

No. So we are waiting for a meeting to wrap it all up and paying the rest of the 2K. And then I'll be reimbursed from the, because I still haven't been reimbursed from the marketing wallet for the first day and a half, because they don't accept crypto payments.

So I just paid it. I forget, did I pay them on Zelle or Venmo? One of the two, because that's what they preferred for payment.

Mm, spent all day on your computer, not deeming you back. I'm sorry, I forgot. I just remembered right now when you put Lemon Drop.

So will we begin to pay the developers again and restart moving forward with the app developers? Yes, absolutely. Like I said, I've already reached out to some of the devs today and just waiting for us, waiting for them to get back to us with very limited funds still.

I know it doesn't seem like it, because yes, this is a lot more than we've had in a while. We just don't wanna blow it in a week and then be stuck again. So we are trying to make the most out of the funds we have.

Lemon Drops, I'm ready. I'm ready for Lemon Drops. I've gotta find, I gotta ask everybody actually in town where the best Lemon Drop place is.

Oh no, you're fine. You're totally good. When receipts?

Right on the blockchain. The receipts are on the blockchain. Blockchain doesn't lie.

I usually put blue cheese on my steaks and today I put shredded cheese. It's not as good. I don't know.

I was too lazy though. I know we have blue cheese somewhere in the fridge, but I didn't have time to look for it. I was trying to make the call.

Heath says, I'm having issues with Transac as well. As soon as I hit buy, it goes white screen. Is this in the app or in their browser or both?

For devs, not hookers and bloat. Yes, for devs. You understand why I'm curious after a scammy loser face and months of wondering where it went.

Yes, absolutely. It's still in the marketing wallet. Most of it hasn't moved.

I actually haven't been reimbursed for, excuse me. I haven't been reimbursed for the money I've paid for bills or devs yet. And not, please don't take that the wrong way.

I haven't turned in my info and everything to be reimbursed. But I mean, I just need to get reimbursed still for all that even. So I haven't even done that.

I will, I need to do it. Actually, tomorrow's the 31st. I need to do it by the end of tomorrow before the end of the month.

Because then after that next month's bills will start coming out too. But yes, absolutely. And yeah, legal will be great about that.

App, okay, as I hit buy. Okay, so then it's a few of you having issues. If you guys are willing or if you do want to, try the website and see if that's giving you the same issue.

I wonder what the issue is. But yeah, I'll let you know as soon as I hear back from them. App, okay.

Wait, what does the Midwest have to do with it? Oh no. Rose killed.

Oh my God, no. Let's share a link. Why are you so rude, Rose?

I'm sorry. That's funny, because she kicks people out for saying trade even when they don't say trade. But even though we took that off our block list, and she still does it.

And sometimes even when people don't say trade. That's very strange. Our app just keeps coming up with more issues.

I need one of the devs to get back to me. But to be honest, most of the purchases that happened, which literally now it's close to $20,000, which has been awesome. It has happened in the last few hours.

So I'm sure the devs probably just haven't gotten back to my DM, or haven't seen my DMs yet. I'm very excited. I'm very excited to drop the FJB and actually start getting approved at places for just being pro-America and pro-everything that is America, right?

And pro-USA and pro-God. And I'm super excited for that. I think the future is looking bright.

I think that'll get us approved in many more places. And gift card, I don't know if you guys have noticed. I don't know if you've noticed it on the app.

Let me see. Let me pull up the app. I'm so sorry if you guys can hear me.

I've literally not eaten all day though. That's like how busy I've been. I've literally been on my computer all day.

No, I shouldn't say that. I lied. I did take the dogs for two walks, but I did not eat.

But I am really sorry if you can hear it. It really grosses me out when I can hear people eat. And when people have the hiccups, it really grosses me out.

I wish it didn't. Okay, let me see. I wanted to see what happens when you go to.

Okay, you guys, I don't think it's live for you yet. Okay, it's not live for you yet, but I think it'll be very excited once we just, all that's left is literally to push them through the Google Play Store and the Apple Store. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, just got kicked out of it.

Yeah, I sent you a link, GoTrucker. You didn't get it? I usually, when I see Rose kick somebody out, I usually send them a link right away.

Oh, I missed a thing. Pierre says, are B&B going to bring on a new face of the coin like Finman, Grant, or are you filling that role now going forward? No, I'd love to get somebody much more involved, so we're waiting on that, and I really hope, I'm very much pushing for B&B to make a commitment to us so we have it figured out for the year so we're not constantly in this limbo.

I understand they're super, super busy, but I hope to have an answer on this very soon so we're no longer in this limbo, because I know you all don't enjoy it, and trust me, I don't. It's been a lot, so we are trying to get somewhere happy medium for everybody that will make everybody kind of happy, and I will update you as soon as I find out. I was hoping to have that done before the end of the month.

We've had, like I said, the call that was, now I think it's been two Tuesdays ago, my last call with the team that was also with the attorney, and I was supposed to hear back about some more information one to two days after that, and it's been now rescheduled for this week, but I'm very excited for that, and know we'll definitely love to have somebody more influential that will bring us more holders.

Ooh, what the heck? How come it's not in my app then? Gift card function.

He says it's in his app. Ed says, let me see. I could have sworn I saw it earlier.

Let me see. I'll have to check on that. Oh, you're right, that is where it's at, because you know why?

I was helping somebody in DMs, and I have to send screenshots, and that's exactly where I saw it, yes. Perfect. I love it.

Oh. Wait. Who else got kicked out?

What was crazy trucker saying? I gotta go now. Wait, wait.

Let's go see what was happening. How did I miss this? There's too much going on.

I'm trying to answer my Discord DMs. I'm trying to keep up with that. Let's see, it's literally been all day, but honestly, it's been good. We've had almost $20,000 in FJB sales from Marketing Wallet.

Sucks, because it doesn't show up on the charts, but it's awesome, because that's money we could use for development. Oh, let's see. Hi, Lauren.

Why are you always late? Gosh. I'm not important enough for you.

I'm trying to see what the good trucker said. I'm still not used to, I'm not used to the whole iPhone thing yet. Definitely not.

Oh, okay. Oh. Oh, that's funny.

I feel like that deserves a screenshot. That's funny. Probably me.

Okay, so regarding, actually regarding, so Ed says the gift card function probably needs to be easier to find for the newbies. So actually it'll come up, they'll have to scan a code or enter a link. And when they do that, it'll automatically bring it up.

So that's more there for, say if you already have an FJB wallet maybe, and still wanna go in and add another gift card or something like that. But in every gift card, you'll have a QR code to scan or enter a link in case you're on desktop or have an older, you know, boomer phone. I don't know if any, do any phones now not have like a QR camera?

Maybe, I don't know. But yeah, so it'll automatically pop up a link or for you to download the app. So it's super, super cool.

I'm honestly ecstatic about it. I can't believe how easy it was. I was testing it on, I believe it was Thursday and Friday.

And I was just, I was so happy. I expected it to be a little bit more complicated and like cumbersome. Can the smart wallet crypto be interacted with in a different wallet or wallet?

Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Yeah, that is a good call. That is a bellow.

Oh. It is pretty clever. It is honestly.

The guy, the main guy who built it is like a genius. I don't wanna say anything that may be taken offensive. Although, yeah, offensive.

Although I wish I could, excuse me. Although I wish I could just to give you guys like more of a background. But he literally is like, I'm pretty sure he's a genius.

It is way better even than we had planned for it to be. Like testing it out was a piece of cake. I cannot wait to do events and just be literally on the side of the road.

I don't care. I'll, you know, put a table out on the side of the road where it's just a dirt lot and a dirt street to sell those with some FJB merch. I don't know.

GoTrucker says, you're worried about offending people here. Have you seen these posts? No, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna come off as like a disrespectful to him saying like some details that are actually like pretty awesome details and why I truly believe like he's a legit genius.

But no. No, I don't think I'm afraid. Well, I don't know.

Trust me. I get all the DMs to all the offensive stuff, okay? I get all the ladies that get, you know, offended, say prayers for us and stuff.

Although I still miss Sandy. I've not heard from Sandy for, since she left Discord and I do miss her. I'm offended.

I'm offended that Sandy just left me. This is how, how do you know they identify as females? I'm offended now.

I'm sorry. There's only like, there's probably under a dozen of us women in here. I can probably count it actually.

Me, Lauren, Sandy, all his glory. Oh, Shadow, where's she been? I haven't seen her.

Shadow. I used to think Paradox was a female, so that doesn't count. Five.

Oh, Pibbs. Pibbs is hot. I love Pibbs.

Who else? There's somebody else that was also around the same time as Pibbs. Who was it?

Oh, Raven. Who was the other girl with Pibbs? Lauren, do you remember?

So I'm up to seven, but there's another girl with Pibbs. I don't remember her. Oh, Legata.

That's who, yes. Yes, that's who it is. Lauren typed it as soon as I ate.

I think that's all I can think of. I'm sure there's probably a few I'm missing, but out of the regulars, you know. Out of how many guys?

Grace, I guess Grace counts too. Mm-hmm. What?

Did a shadow sell out? What? Janna is a dude.

But I guess she identifies as a she, I think. No, that's a full-on dude. Ed says, what do you mean?

P6 isn't female? I had a crush. Oh my gosh.

Go Trucker says, what's happening in this world? Janna, gosh, those are some memories. You guys realize Janna's like a person on YouTube, right?

It's actually hilarious if you want a good laugh. Just saying, if you want a good laugh, go for it. You should go Google it.

Not joking. You'll be in disbelief. But I think it's more fun if you've been, like you've seen the interactions.

Lauren and I have in Discord. Oh, so I hope I didn't miss anybody else. That's like the most, you know.

Go Truckers and Crazy Trucker. I don't think I've seen your names together. Oh my gosh, I just realized it was you two.

Yeah, Rose. I'm pretty sure Rose is female. Her name is Rose.

Rose. Watch, she's gonna show up again and just ban you because you're talking bad about her. Sun Devil, can you do a scripted interview with Grace?

She posts on her socials, cover some FJB bullet points, history, future. Yeah, I'm more than happy to do that. I asked Grace too if she would, for her address, for us to send her some FJB merch to share, but I never heard back from her.

So if anybody can get Grace on board, I'd be more than happy to do that. I'd be happy to do an interview with whoever, which is why it really sucks, right? So with the funds we have now, which is why we're being very careful with those to spend them very wisely and to try to outsource cheaper devs, I mean, to say it like it is, because we, I mean, guess what?

We have a ton of missing funds and this is all the funds we have and without funds, there's not really much we could do, right? So we not only need the funds to get the app up and just functioning in functioning order, but also we need some marketing money. Like that costs a lot, whether it is influencers, and yes, I know we laugh about that, but influencers that actually influence their, that have real followers and actually influence their followers, excuse me, or whether it's interviews or local events or anything like that, that all costs money.

I know somebody actually DM'd me like a few months ago, like, hey, are we allowed to just go anywhere and set up a table at an event? Like that costs nothing, we could do that right away. And it sucks because it doesn't cost nothing and it doesn't happen right away.

You need to fill out, if it's any decent event that you're actually gonna get sales in and that people are actually gonna be at and spend money, likely you need to fill out an application in advance, likely that's gonna be inexpensive. I mean, each event, it's probably around ballpark of a grand if you actually want to sell and you want people to buy because they price them, they price them depending on how many guests, I guess, they're expecting. So, yeah, all to say that.

Ooh, I've missed a few. Now that gift cards are integrated, when do you think tables will be set up? Oh, that's why, I mean, ASAP, that's why I want the app.

That's why as soon as we got those sales today, I started the marketing wallet, FJB Sales. I DMed the devs and we wanna get started ASAP. So as soon as we want the app, at least in working orders, cause I'm sure some of you in here probably have open DMs with me regarding issues you're having with the app and I'm sure it'll be some simple fix that's happening, whether change now, change some minimums or whether a transact, change some minimums and it screwed everything up.

Um, but yeah, ASAP, absolutely. I've just, most of today was honestly spent on helping people with issues they were having. A few sales that didn't take a ton of time.

But yeah, but I have to get started next weekend. I'm very, very excited to start that. Why trade and diet?

Who decides blocked words? Do you control a Rose settings? Yes.

So trade is one, we got a list from like the War Room Telegram and they're the ones that recommended Rose, right? So they had a list, they gave us like a list of all their banned words and trade is cause a lot of people will come in here and try to shill their stock or their crypto, right? But we actually removed it cause we saw a lot of people were using the word trade, obviously were crypto, right?

But even after we removed it, Rose still has some glitch where she kicks people out. But the thing is she kicks people out even when they don't say trade, which is funny and then says that's why. And then diet is a word cause there are so many people who come in here and shill like diet pills.

And so then it automatically blocks them. Rose must be allergic to cats. Hey, I am super allergic to cats.

Super allergic. Tried dating somebody with a cat once, actually twice. The second guy though, I learned my lesson.

I was like, I can't come to your house. Oh, I feel bad. His dad told him to get rid of his cat.

I feel like a cat hater. Hmm. Are we having a Jerry Lewis marathon tonight or what?

What? Oh boy. Maybe she's premenstrual.

Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. Maybe or maybe Rose is going through menopause.

Who knows? I don't know. But yeah, I am super, super excited.

I am so happy. We are so close. And again, I'm sorry what happened last night.

It was just absolutely awful, but we're gonna use it as a teaching opportunity. And, you know, I mean, that was the plan to add more things on the website. We're waiting on a few.

The FAQ for the website is completed. We are waiting on a few details. And that will be completed after our call with, or my call with the attorney this week.

And then after that, we're doing a gift card page on the website. And then after that, we'll go back to the educational part and just stressing to never, never, never, never. And, you know, if you've DM'd me about help, about your wallet, I always tell you, please do not share your seed phrase, not with me, not with anyone, because I don't want you screenshotting your, you know, seed phrase to me.

I don't want you accidentally saying, oh, is this what you're talking about? But please, under no circumstances or support should anybody or will anybody ever need your seed phrase. Just put it in your safe and forget it.

Unless you get a new phone or something like that and need it again, there should be no reason that you ever need it. GoTrucker says, I feel terrible for that person. If there's anything we can do as a community to help.

Oh yeah, somebody did. Actually, let me pull that. Somebody wanted to send him some coins.

So I had him make a new wallet. He is going through insurance claims process, but to be honest with you, I'd be very surprised if they did anything about that. I don't think insurance would cover that, but who am I?

I hope they do. Let's see. Somebody said, I'm gonna try to find that.

[Speaker 2]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
So that's his new wallet. That he created. I did tell him somebody asked for one, so if he could make a new one.

The holder seemed like an experienced crypto user, must have been pretty sophisticated scam. Yeah, unfortunately, you just gotta never do that, because they insist. I've seen the screenshots.

They will keep going. Once they think that you're maybe, maybe, maybe believing them, they'll start pretty much begging you. It's awful.

So, so awful. You have to be a real scumbag to do something like that. Yeah, I wouldn't be able to sleep the night.

I have like such a conscious. Yeah, I would not be able to sleep the night. I hate it.

Actually, it's like a gift and a curse, because I'm not like, I don't wear my heart on my sleeve for the most part, really. I'm the kind of person that's like, all right, get over it, let's move on. But then I am like very, very like hypersensitive to other people's feelings, if that makes sense.

So I feel like, like at the end of the day, I always like review my day like, oh my gosh, did I upset anybody? So yeah, I would not like, my conscious would not be able to take that. But hey, there's a special place in hell for people like that.

I 100% wholeheartedly believe that. Oops, sorry, did not mean to slurp my drink. Oh wow.

Oh wow, that's nuts. That's crazy. Ooh, Velo's back.

In response to Pierre's question, can the smart wallet crypto be interacted with in a different wallet or only an FJB wallet? Velo says, this sounds like a Web3 question. Can you pose that as a specific question?

What are you trying to do? Who lost the bag? Who am I sending FJB to?

Well, he did, I feel like I can say it, because he did, he did post about it in, let me see. Sorry, I'm looking for it. That's why I'm in executive privilege chat in Discord, and it's Brandog.

I'll post a thing in case you guys aren't familiar with him. And he already told me that I can share it if I want to, and I didn't want to yesterday. I just didn't want you guys going after him.

Not that I thought you would, but he already felt very, very terrible about the charts. But this is it. I just put it in the chat screenshot if you all want to read that.

So that's who it would be going to. Oh yeah, is anybody down for Houston? Did we already talk about that?

I feel like we already did, but nobody really committed. Houston, the 12th, Houston, Texas, the 12th to the 14th. Gotta figure out what kind of events we do there.

Or a event, or just a meetup. I don't know, whatever you guys want to do.

[Speaker 2]
Shoot, what is this?

[Speaker 1]
Get barbecue at, how do you even say that? Bookies? I don't know.

That sounds good. I'm down. I'm down for anything that has meat.

Oh, no. Ooh, pronounce buckies. Okay, thank you.

Gas station, but good barbecue. That's funny, because funny enough, I had some really good Mediterranean food in New Hampshire out of all areas, Dover, New Hampshire, and it was like this gas station restaurant, which I've never, like, we don't have those here as far as I know, but it was so good. So we'll have to try that.

Buckies, I'll probably have to ask for that again. Please fix the transaction log history in app. Yes, that's definitely on that list, but, you know, unfortunately, we're out of funds.

That's what happens when all your funds just mysteriously go missing. Oh, gosh, I can't wait for that, guys. Let me tell you, I can't wait for that.

I just, you know, I just can't stand people doing wrong. Like, just be a decent human. I mean, that's a terrible thing that happened to Brandon.

Yeah, really, really awful, so sad. And I know, again, like, it's so easy in that situation to be like, oh, what a dumbass, like, who does that? But honestly, every time I know of that that's happened to holders here, it's happened when they just have, like, an off day.

Like I was saying earlier, the last time it happened, I forget who it is. Who was it? I feel like he hasn't been here in a while now, because I can't even think of the name.

Who was it? Oh, my gosh, but anyway, he had COVID that week. And it's crazy, because he was literally always posting, like, the, you know, don't give your seed phrase, and admins won't DM you.

He was always posting those GIFs, like, all the time. So when it happened, I was like, what? Aren't you always posting those GIFs?

Like, you're the one always telling people to not share their seed phrase. But it just happens on, like, your off day, you know? Like, that's, like anything else, you know?

It's like when you have a car accident, you're like, oh, I'm, you know, I'm one of the best drivers, or whatever. And that's when they get you. They get you, and you're just having a complete off day, and that's what happens.

So, really, really sucks. Super sad. It's super sad what it did to our charts, because I know you guys have been buying the heck out of the charts.

So, yeah. Yeah, all to say, yeah. I'm like, cats in the truck.

The ultimate warrior said, well, charts sucked before the scam. Just glad we weren't at, yeah, four zeros and a nine. This crypto thing is very, very, very confusing.

One of the reasons I invested so heavily was how easy the app worked before the woke wire screwed us. Absolutely. It is a brilliant idea, and it's perfect for, hello, hi.

I don't think the truckers did that on purpose. I muted you. But, yes, absolutely.

It is the perfect, really, such an easy app when it's working. Yes, I realize, you know, I realize I hear you all in my DMs, trust me. I realize a lot of it is broken right now, and just like last time, I'm sure there'll be easy fixes, but this is why we need funds to maintain it.

It's very unfortunate that all these funds went missing. That could've really got us, you know, somewhere much sooner, but I am determined because I really, truly believe how great this app is, and more so even just the community standing behind it, and I really am saying that because I really do mean it. Excuse me.

Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry. That is so gross.

I did not mean to slurp my drink. Actually, I have another one here. All right, spill the beans.

Who misplaced the funds? Oh, I think that's obvious as day, and like I said, if nobody else pursues them legally, trust me, I will through the criminal legal system. Admit it was a water bong.

No, it's a margarita, but I'm out of it, and so I just grabbed my water now. I'm out of it, but it's so hot here still. The ice just melts, and then I keep like going like, oh, okay, I'll drink that, but then I get really grossed out and people slurp their drinks.

I'm like, oh my gosh. You guys, I'm sure can probably hear everything. Will some of the smart wallet transactions get smoothed out?

I saw in chats, Pierre and others had issues. Yes, absolutely. A lot of issues people are having are just not seeing, so your smart wallet address will be different than your expert mode wallet, which expert mode is just when your smart wallet is not on and it's off.

You're in expert mode, right? And those two wallets will have separate addresses because of the way everything's set up, and I'm sure you can get more details from that from Velo if you'd like, but I am not that sophisticated in that realm. But yes, that's a lot of the issue that people are having.

They are putting coins somewhere else and smart wallet or expert mode, and then looking for it in smart wallet and vice versa. You can always put your seed phrase in trust wallet too, just as a precaution, like it won't hurt. That way, if you ever have misplaced your vest recovery or what have you, then you also have it in trust wallet.

I do that just because I'm paranoid. You're the one that has held this together Oh, thank you. That's very, very kind.

I would not be here if I still didn't wholeheartedly believe in this project and really how far we can go. Unfortunately, we've just had some shitty people. I'll say it like it is.

I think that's just awful, and I think with real conservative people with conservative values that we will get somewhere. Great. And I think, yeah, I think that's, I think that makes the difference.

I think that makes or breaks everything most of the time. I think integrity goes a long way. Yeah, very, very unfortunate to happen to a conservative project.

It's everything that we all hate and go against, and it's terrible. What happened to us is terrible. What's happened to us again and again and again, and that's what proves that the community is really what's been holding this coin up, and that's honestly why I've been so determined to try to make it work, because I truly believe in this community.

Let's see. Ugh, me too. Me too.

I cannot listen to that song. Went to FJB convention in Vegas. Ooh, that'd be nice.

I'd be down for that. I'd be down for that. Let me see.

I think I received, actually, I think I just received a DM with some questions. Okay. How soon, this is a question from my DMs. Also, how soon do you think before the white paper is released?

Okay, so the issue with the, oh, goodnight, Ultimate Warrior East Coast. Yeah, it's gotta be 7, 8, 9, 9.15. That's way past my bedtime, although I've been waking up like 2 a.m. lately. Gosh.

Okay, back to the question about the white paper. So the issue with that is, I just don't want to release a white paper to you all with all these wonderful promises that gets us all excited if we don't actually have a 100% commitment from BNB for everything on there. Right?

So that's where that is. I don't want to give you false promises, false hopes, let you down. So that's where we're at with that.

As soon as we get everything squared away with BNB, we will move forward with that. And this is why I am working to get them to commit something on a monthly basis, whatever it is, really, just so we're not in this limbo, just so we have something that's scheduled, that the community understands, that BNB understand, that everybody can kind of meet in the middle on. So that's where we are, sorry, as far as the white paper goes.

The guys have done great on writing, on editing. Everything looks beautiful, but we don't want to just get that out and just release it to you just because it sounds good, like it's happened before, and then not go through with it. We've had a truly unexpectedly bumpy road.

We really deserve some good news soon. Yes, absolutely. I agree.

I very much agree. That's why I'm really, really, really excited for the gift card and events. And I hope that our meeting goes on around Wednesday when it's supposed to.

Let's get our ducks in a row, 100% integrity from here on out. Yep, I absolutely agree. Can't wait.

Can't wait. I'm super excited. Like I said, honestly, the gift card, like when was our meeting?

Ah, shoot, I can't remember now if it was, I think Thursday, because I don't think it was Friday. But I was honestly so, so, so happy. I couldn't believe it was even better than we had planned.

It was better than I imagined it was gonna be. So, so excited. I think so too.

Yes, I think so. And don't get me wrong, I've gotten, I wanna say two, I've gotten DMs from a few people, like nobody's gonna buy a gift card, that's a dumb idea. Well, the whole idea, again, remember with gift cards, it's not, you know, yeah, sure, you can go gift your friend or, you know, your mom one or whatever for her birthday, for Valentine's Day, you know, what have you.

But just remember that it's actually more so for events, because if we try selling these at events, I don't know about you guys, but I know my parents or my grandparents would be like, ah, I'll do that later. Like, I mean, come on, you've gone through the process. Are you gonna go through and do KYC and pull out your driver's license and, you know, call your bank account and take a selfie?

Like, you're not gonna do that while you're, if I'm out at an event, like, I wanna relax, I'm not working right now, don't bother me, you know, I'm not, I just wanna, you know. So the whole idea behind the gift card is really just so they can slide their card, you give them the card, that's it, they're on their way. So they don't tell you, ah, yeah, yeah, I'll do that, I'll be back later, I'll do that later.

So I really do think it's a great idea. To be honest with you, I don't even know how we came up with it. To be honest with you, I don't remember.

If anybody remembers how we came up with it or who came up with it, because I don't think it was my idea, but I'm not sure. So if anybody remembers, go ahead and refresh my memory, send me a DM or, you know, if you're in chat right now. But yeah, I think it's brilliant.

So yeah, I think it's brilliant. And again, please keep in mind, it's not so you can, oh, you know, give it to your mom or whatever. We realize you guys have bought enough, but this is more so for events.

So people can just buy a card, slide their card, you know, debit card, credit card, whatever, on a little square machine, iPad, what have you, and be on their way, receive an envelope, and they can go, once they're home, they can then scan the QR code. And I can't tell you how easy it is. It's so insanely easy.

So yeah, it's beautiful. Gift cards, make purchases as simple as they can be. Yeah, honestly, like it can't get any more simple than that.

No, I appreciate you very much. Keep holding everybody. Oh, that's so nice.

Thank you. There's just one more way for people to buy FJB. Yeah, absolutely.

And I think it's awesome too, if we couple it with shirts or hats, that's awesome too, you know, because really we can make them, you know, whatever amount we want to, right? So, and yeah, simple is definitely the way because, you know, the easier something is, the less excuses people will have. Gotta think about the first time you bought crypto.

I know the first time I bought crypto, I was very frustrated, although I get very frustrated if I don't figure stuff out.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
When video on website to teach on gift cards, maybe step by step. You know, oh gosh, why can I, I want to call him one of my friend's name, but I know that's not the name I'm thinking about. I'm thinking of a friend's name to put to him.

Oh my gosh, I feel awful. He's huge, come on, why can't, why am I trying to call him my friend's name? Turok, trying to call him my friend's name, his Tudor.

It's pretty close actually. Turok said he would do that as soon as it was finalized. So I don't know if he's still up to it because I haven't seen him in quite a long time.

But even with, even if Turok's no longer willing to do that, we'll definitely have that. That'll be super awesome. Mm-hmm, yeah, I think bundles will be great too.

Just because if you add, you know, a hat or a shirt, even a, you know, 10 bucks a pop, whatever, just to add it, I think would be awesome.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm, all right.

[Speaker 1]
I wish the app was ready to go. It's time, yes, absolutely. Like I said, as soon as we got all those funds today and we didn't have to sell, you know, I mean, we sold, but indirectly, not, you know, didn't impact the charts at all.

Yeah. Just waiting on those DMs back from the devs and I think we'll be good to go. I think Velo will be very, very excited to start getting paid again too once the funds start rolling in.

Doo, doo, doo. You just hit the wall. Hopefully you're just talking about a tired wall, not like a physical wall.

Oh, good night. I know, it's late while you guys are. All right, any other questions before I head out?

I'm gonna finish my dinner and then probably feed my dogs. Oh, my pleasure. It would not be possible with all of you, so thank you because you all are the ones holding this community up, not me.

All right, well, I think that's about it. As always, if you have any questions, please reach out in DMs or in chats. Again, I know I'm getting in the role of things and getting more active in chats, especially this coming week, month, but I am still here, so if you DM me, I'm usually almost on my computer.

All right, well, you guys have a wonderful night. We can do another voice midweek if you all want to. I just figured we needed one after what happened last night.

If not, I will see you all on Friday voice as usual with all the Discord guys. And if I do get any updates, if our call with the attorney happens before that and any major news or anything like that, I for sure will do a voice call or at least announce it and tag everybody. But let me know.

Like I said, I'm always available to help. So, all right, I think that's all. Thank you all so much.

Thank you for your patience. I promise we will get through this. Can't tell you exactly how, because we're taking it as we go, but I think we're all here because we truly believe in this project and this idea.

We finally are having funds go where they need to go. Again, I know it's super, super unfortunate what's happened or who knows, no telling where we would be with all the funds that we had. But look at that, we're building back up and we for sure will get there.

I will be in chat. All right, you guys have a great night.
