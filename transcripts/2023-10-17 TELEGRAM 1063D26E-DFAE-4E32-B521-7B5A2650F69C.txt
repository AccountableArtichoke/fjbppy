Sorry, I did not start the music. I got the flu in the last 24 hours, the flu or COVID or something, so I'm not exactly on my A-game. I hope everybody's doing well.

Hope everybody had a great weekend. Let's see, I don't have any major updates. We're still trucking along.

Definitely getting closer. We are still within our timeline. As of right now, I will update you if that changes.

The devs are still working on the app as far as the failed transactions. They have not figured that out yet. I will let you know as soon as they do.

That's kind of where we're at. Let's see, I don't think I received any DMs. I was at the mechanics all day, so I was on my phone, and I don't think I received anything. Definitely doesn't look like I did, but do let me know if you have any questions.

Check the email. I just checked it a few minutes ago again, but I'll check that too. Cool.

Yeah, I got nothing on my end. I do have a DM regarding XT. I will get back to you as soon as I'm done with the voice chat.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Do the devs still get paid if they're unable to figure out how to fix the app? Yes. Yes, the devs get paid either by project or hourly, depending.

Sometimes it's a lump sum up to so many hours, and then per hour after that, it takes longer than expected. Okay. White paper roadmap ready for release?

Yes, we are. It's, I want to say, I don't know, maybe 80, 90 percent there. Waiting on the review.

Sorry, I've got to be very careful with my words just to make sure that everything there is set, but I think you all will enjoy it. Other than that, everything is still going as expected. Third party is still just waiting on us to begin.

Review finishing this week? We are still on track, yes, to have that completed this week, so hoping that still goes as expected. So far, so good.

I'm very, very happy about that. Make me super happy about that. It's been kind of quiet in here the last several days, I feel like, too.

Okay. You mentioned three events. When's the first one scheduled?

I believe the first one is the 28th, I think, of this month. I think that's, I think that's the first one off the top of my head. I don't think we've seen the one before that.

Yes, I am looking forward to that. I'm going to drink my hot tea. I don't know.

Any updates? I feel like I've been out of the loop with how quiet it's been in here. All banners, I'm assuming, and advertisement material, prints, etc.

are ready for event. We should be receiving, or I should be receiving everything in the mail by this Friday. Update you guys as soon as I receive it.

I already started getting some of the merch. How quickly will the second reviewer start after the first? They are able to start same day.

As soon as they're done. As soon as the first review is done. The second one can begin.

They're also just waiting for us. So that's awesome. Very grateful for that.

Just you at the event or some more people? Just me for now. I do have an advertisement up, but we'll begin that as we sort of pick up.

How long will the second review take? We were quoted one to three days, but I'm sure we'll get a closer estimate once that begins. I need help.

With what? Are you beginning? Do you want to do a review?

You want to help review? Help the devs? Has anyone my Patriot vehicle?

No, I have an FJV coin one on my vehicle, but I do not have one with the website. It's not just like one of those. That's my brake light.

Or like on my reverse light. Does that make sense? Are events all over the US or just AZ?

So the ones so far are in AZ, the ones we've applied for. Shoot me any events in your area and we'd be happy to do them there. I think that'd be really cool.

I think we should be safe and do three reviews. Four. Five.

Just keep going with the reviews. Win fork. Patriot pretty shirts and hats.

Fork when we can afford the exchange fees. Shirts and hats. Yes.

Shirts, hats, stickers. What kind of size crowd are we expecting for this first event? One to two thousand people.

Mostly very, very conservative. TPUSA. Yes, we are still in talks with TPUSA.

We'd love to get on their December event this year. College events in general. I think it'd be great.

Get Kaylee on board. I know I love her. I'd love to get in contact with her too when the elections are going on, but I know they're super busy with some other stuff.

She's been on War Room a ton, so. Win fork. I told you.

When we can afford. When we can afford the relisting fees on the exchanges. Right now I think everything we have in the wallets would probably barely cover that.

Are you getting hair and makeup done for the event? Yeah, I may actually shower. Win fork, win twerk.

You guys are really trying to get off the finance chain. Let's get on War Room with Gary. That would be awesome.

Shower probably good enough.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
BNB likely going to tank soon. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of tanked, I'd say, right? Which is weird, but it's, I wonder what, what are they trying to do?

I feel like it was a crazy media last 24 hours of BNB. Just reiterating news that everybody already knew. But dogs are all too sick to kick them out.

Ed says he hasn't seen the BNB medias, probably because you're not in the States. So they stopped, well, they're reporting again. Stock US withdraws.

Friday you said the reviewers were ahead of schedule. Has that changed a bit? No, we've just moved some of the steps around.

The order, if that makes sense. Everything is still going very smoothly, thank God. I was, I was ready for that.

Especially with how insane this weekend was. When am I going to be reaching? Any big changes come from review?

Not so far, no, thankfully. Not so far. If smart wallet is unfixable, we still move forward without it?

Yes, we will still move forward with task even if the app is not ready. Ideally, we'd love it to be ready, but we'll still move forward. And if for whatever reason smart wallet is truly unfixable, as Ed says, then we will find another way.

I know I've seen some of you guys make fun of the reviews, but I think it would be kind of awful to spend all this time and all these dev hours and doll hairs and have something go wrong. So it's kind of, kind of like the most important part in a way. I did hear, oh, was that?

I forgot, I hadn't looked into that. Was that a fake news or was that, I did hear that halloweenfloppy.rug. Is that true? Let's see if I can find anything.

Just look at the chart. How many hours have dev spent fixing failed transaction? I don't have those hours right now.

So far, they're still within the lump sum estimate that they gave us. Are they still working on the app now? Yes.

And I will clarify, this is a different dev team than the dev team working on the review. So that is not hindering the review in any way. Oh, I see packages.

In front of my house. I see three people typing stable. When the task is revealed, will we see a big change with the app?

No, likely not. And the task will be independent from the app. If the app's not ready, we will still go live.

We'll update it in a minute. Will we be a hack crew with the tabs or with the app? The devs are doing everything they can, and they have in the past, with the app to, yes, to ensure that we have the safest protocols in place.

And of course, that will evolve. As the, whatever the devs say needs to be done. They can deal with all the smart technical details.

What percent of failed transactions have been fixed? They've not figured out the cause for the failed transactions. That's something they're still working on.

And it's like, it likely will be just one. I mean, if it's anything like the past, it'll likely just be, you know, one or two reasons that things are failing. So not exactly a percentage.

If they figure it out, it'll likely be for most, if not all transactions. MP Bob can't make live voice chat or listen to recording. Can you say hi to him?

Oh, hi, MP. I didn't get any questions from you today. Should we get a few for him in the inbox?

Him. I think it's him, right? Yeah, I did say hi to him.

Sometimes I've assumed, you know, like when I thought Paradox was a female. Because he's so freaking organized. MP Bob is here.

He's laughing. Is that true? Or are you laughing at me?

But I don't know. You did say him earlier. Six of four equals six.

What? What are you talking about? Oh, P6.

My last paradox. P6. By the way, please get your coins off XT.

I know one of you messaged me on Discord. I'll get back to you as soon as I'm done with the call to help you out with that. If you do have coins on XT or know anybody that does, please transfer those off ASAP.

Email, DM, tag me if you need any help doing that so we can get you all taken care of. Please do that ASAP. They've not given us a deadline, but we just want to be, better be safe than sorry.

So we are trying to get everybody to move their coins sooner than later. There is still quite a bit of coins on XT. Quite a few of you holders on there, so please get those off.

It's more coins than I expected for how many people are not moving them. Okay. Sean John has buddy with coins stuck in blank.

Where's that? Oh, huh. Let him, yeah, please contact me if you have coins stuck in LBANG or XT or anywhere else.

The app is the only one we're still working on, especially if you have them in the smart wallet. If you have in your expert mode wallet, you can access that still through Trust Wallet. DM me and I can help you with that.

But yeah, please tell whoever Sean's friend is to contact me so we can get him taken care of because he should be able to feel like you can more easily log into XT or LBANG if you lost your credentials versus like a seed phrase that you can't really help you out with that. How many coins are still on XT? Quite a bit.

What happens to coins on XT after test goes live? I'm not sure. Oh, excuse me.

Oh my gosh. Drinking all the teas, taking NAC, taking fermented honey and garlic. I think that's everything.

I'm hoping to have a bigger update by the end of the week. But you guys know how that goes. So I will keep you updated.

Hopefully we do stay on track. That would be ideal. And that way we can still wrap this up by the end of the month.

It's nice because this month has 31 days. I also selfishly want that to happen because I have some personal medical stuff that I want to get done with. But if you do need anything, please go ahead and email, DM, or tag me so we can get you taken care of.

As always, don't share your seed phrase. Click on any weird links. I know Trustroller was weird, actually, when I logged in there.

Looks like they're maybe rebranding or something like that. So just be wary of that. If you need any help, nobody will be asking for your seed phrase.

Let me know if you all need anything else. Otherwise, I will see you in the chats. I will post this right now with a few notes.

Give me just a few minutes because I'm gonna go check my packages first. I'm excited for a few of those. Otherwise, I'll update you if I have any updates before Friday.

If not, I will see you here Friday. You guys have a great night!
