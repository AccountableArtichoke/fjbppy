(0:15 - 2:17)
Hello, what's going on everybody? Oh, we got 24-7 premium. What the hell does that mean? How do we disconnect this? Oh, somebody disconnected it for me. That's pretty big time. 

Huh? What's up drills waiting for you? I was about to say it's true coming up or what? Now he's not talking to me. Maybe I'm not maybe I'm not the one talking. Hey, let me say I need the I need the Every you can hear you nice. 

You knew my question Yeah, we hear you. What's up, brother? How you doing? How's everything going today? No, we just need a little bit more momentum more momentum right now, but this is I'll send what I'm looking at right now in terms of the chart and it's getting me excited because I am an equity trader as well. I haven't really done anything since this coin started, but actually, we know openly open it up. 

And I maybe because it's one of those things when you are like a bull trader, like I am, then you're like, Oh, you see, do you see just see patterns? But take a look at this. I whenever I look at things that are like a week old. And it's my weird strategy. 

But I'll send this in the general chat. I look at the 12 hour chart, I always look at the one minute chart. And I look at the 12 hour chart. 

It's weird. But are we are we seeing something cute showing up right here? I'm seeing some I'm seeing some really cute in the general chat. And that's a nice bull flag right before an all time high break. 

That looks like we're about to smoke some resistance. And we're about to go way above this bitch. So that's what I've been looking at today. 

The only chart that I've seen right now is the 12 see Scott stocks as somebody spank me because I know that Scott stocks likes to trade some bull flags to the flags. Almost never lie. So that got me excited today when I saw it.

(2:17 - 3:08)
I know has 34 loves the flags. I know he likes the flags very much. I see a beautiful handle. 

Look at that dude. It's absolutely looking great. And it's we have a very technical coin, which is tremendous. 

Let me see. Let me open this up about the holders. How many holders we got right now 6216 holders. 

That's fucking amazing. And I couldn't be more happy with how this community has been handling everything. There's been a lot of things going on. 

There's been I haven't been as active, nor have the other developers are working on a shit ton of things behind the scenes, trying to get everything figured out, trying to get everything all squared away and situated. And we're doing the absolute best we can. I can assure you that I actually I'm gonna see if I can find my screen time report or something like that the last one.

(3:08 - 3:57)
But it was legitimately like, like 18 and 18 hours and 48 minutes. I remember saying and I was like, I am. This is the worst thing in the world. 

But I love it. I love it. I couldn't imagine it to be any better. 

So the first thing I want to do today is actually send some thank yous. Because I see I look at the chat all the time. And even if I'm not texting in it, or typing in it, there's tremendous people in this group. 

And it legitimately is amazing. We have I'm gonna give some shout outs right now, as I'm going, I'm looking at the list right now. Driz has been great since the beginning. 

I remember him. Oh, now my the bar on my thing is freaking out. Let me take a look. 

Oh, stop it. Raven trade has been great since the start to I think he might have been here like day one. I don't know how he got here so early, but he's been here since big black jiggity.

(3:57 - 4:49)
I don't even know who big I haven't I have not heard big black jiggity his voice, I would love to hear his voice actually, and start chitchat with him. But he's been fucking fantastic. Sierra golf has been awesome since the beginning. 

Where we got MK has been here since the start as well. face investor has been answering a lot of questions. Scott stocks has been bringing the juice and everybody go and deputy swan has been running our Facebook page and kicking ass. 

Oh, shit. I'm Oh, I think I just broke my chair. Did I break my chair? No, it's still good. 

I can like lock my chair and I locked it and unlocked and I thought I broke my chair like that. I think I'm putting on some weight. I think it's all those frickin chicken nuggets and stuff. 

Drew solo just hopped up here. Drew. Dude, I think I'm eating too many hot dogs. 

I think I'm getting I'm like a five pound bag of sausage in a two pound bag. Drew solo has been kicking ass. He's up here getting everything great.

(4:49 - 5:18)
Who else we got here? Twan's been here since the beginning. I think he's in here all day long. 24 hours a day. 

weenie hut juniors bring in the juice whenever we're getting any any dips and telling all the sellers that they're not being cute. Rayan is kicking ass and coming back to me and reporting a bunch of stuff. Spite's been awesome. 

Non Arcus has been awesome. Our moderator for Reddit and another moderator for here. Our let's go Brandon is doing fantastic.

(5:18 - 7:21)
Has 34. I've never seen some more optimism for the coin that has 34 in here. Bob 24. 

He made like a bunch of stickers and like QR codes and he was slapping them around places and that's just like that just is the start. I can go on all I can look at every single name here. We have 191 people here. 

Almost every name here besides a couple and be like I've had an interaction with them and it's been nothing but great. Chicago Jacobs animosity 2k no name 123 is like Raven. It's it's awesome. 

Donald pump like we have the best community in the world and I was actually I was on I don't know if he's on here right now, but Ryan Forner has been tremendous behind the scenes right now, but I was on a call today with him and we were on the call with a couple of influencers trying to get some some more. Like TikToks, Instagrams, publications and stuff like that rolling out, which is, which is what I'm going to start speaking about later. Ryan was basically hyping up our coin to this person and they were like, hey, look, what's like what's your numbers like? Like how many holders? How many days have you been around? And they've worked with. 

He said he's worked with 14 cryptocurrencies. He's like, how many holders you have? How many days you been around? What's your percentage increase since the start of the coin? What's your market cap? Like all the questions and I listed everything all for him and he was like, I have never seen a coin with your growth and like steadiness ever. And he was like, I work with 14. 

So he's like, I definitely have a big pool size, but it's not like huge. But he's like, I've seen like a coin get to like 3000 holders. And then two days later, it was down to like 600. 

And he's like, and they just basically just wiped the floor. He's like, for you guys to steadily increase, he was like, have you seen like an increase in your coin holders every day? I was like, I can't remember a day where it's like we opened up at 5000 and closed at 4000. Like, that does not happen. 

And watch, that's amazing. But even even more so, like, just look at our market cap, what is it right now? Like, fucking 65 million, it was like 70, I think 73 million at one point today. It's like and our chart looks fantastic.

(7:21 - 7:50)
We have, as you can see, oh, I get on here and then people start to sell a bunch of a bunch of weenie juniors, a bunch of weenie juniors, the sellers are not being cute. And that's okay, they're gonna sell perfectly fine. It happens. 

It's that's people come here to buy and sell. But there's even reaching out to a lot of influencers, a lot of things. I've been here on my end, I've basically my role in the beginning was to make sure that everything in the chat was running smooth, everything was running great.

(7:51 - 9:36)
But now I've gotten to a point where I can almost take a backseat in the chat. And it's like self sustainable, which is tremendous. And I love that so much. 

I love just hopping in here and just basically saying, Hey, like, how's everybody doing? And I love doing that. Because on the back end, I'm in phone calls all day long. Literally talking to people left and right, trying to figure everything out. 

When are the he says, When are the billboards up? What will it be up? clip? That's, that's something to ask for animosity. He was the one handling that animosity. 2k is one handling the billboards. 

I've actually like that must actually like slipped my mind. Because I forgot about that. But um, that's awesome. 

We're getting those billboards going up. Um, is there a chart to see how many wallets are on a timeline? I wish I could see that. But so what? Okay, now I'm getting sidetracked. 

I'm starting to read the chat. That's usually what I do later on. But we've been trying to hash out some big time deals, some huge players, news incoming, just trying to schedule a tease and dot the eyes. 

And I know exactly, remember, the billboards were the biggest of our hype. If pro capital makes a good point. If I came up here and was like, Hey, we're gonna go do these billboards every single night. 

For the fact that I'm forgetting that just just know that we have a lot bigger fish to fry. Right now, that is going to blow this coin off. Okie dokie. 

He's been awesome. He's our camper, right? And he's been here since the start. And I thought when he first hopped on here, I thought he was Zach Morris. 

But so I wish I could give you guys some more updates we have. Okay, so we have, I don't think I can give their names to be honest. But we are waiting on publication from some media sources.

(9:37 - 12:53)
Going to be writing an official piece, getting some actual digital publication out, which is going to be awesome. It's because once we get digital publication, you basically have like, not like verbal agreements, but we have conversations with other media source outlets that are like, Hey, you guys drop this, we'll drop this. And it's like a domino effect. 

So all you need is one, all you need is one official publication, which is going to be great. Digital publication then turns into actual like media publication, where people are talking about as people are doing all of that. Again, it's not as easy as it may seem to get that going. 

So we are working on getting that. We have like 50 million things that we're working on. We're getting everything all set up. 

And the because you popped it in earlier wasn't Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's all my notes to broke out the job reading that as we're coming in the exchange. So we're it's it's pro bit and white bit. 

We've been talking to them both. We've been trying to iron out the final details. It's Wednesday, and they were original time was going to be 1am Thursday. 

So like, I guess in what like seven hours, we have a new official time. Pull it up, I have it on my notes right here. The new and the final time for pro bit is now 1am on Friday. 

For some reason, it's 1am, which is a pain in the ass. But it is that's what we're waiting on. And I wish I could tell you right now that it was like, Hey, we're going to be released in six or seven hours, whatever it is. 

But they're trying to do whatever they have to do for their exchange, and whatever they have in terms of their implementation. Let me see if I can find it right here if we can get that implementation. But as soon as we have an update, we're gonna I'm going to get it to you guys. 

We've been working with them. Again, it's like you work with these consultants that are I've mentioned in the chat before you work with these consultants and like a telegram mini group chat. And you're like, Hey, yes, 1am Eastern time zone, you're very trash. 

I'll write that in the in the end, like the announcements. But basically, we that's what like, we're figuring out and it's it's not. Oh, they don't sound sexy sounding in the chats. 

The chats are very annoying to type in because you type in something. And then they'll message you like six hours later and just say like, Sir, that's all they'll say. And it's unbelievable. 

I'm like, Where are you just getting served from? I'm like, Okay, can you answer our questions for the past six hours. But once that implementation goes through, it's going to be tremendous. We're getting on pro bit, white bit, they haven't given us an official timeline. 

Originally, they were like, Wednesday, or Friday. And now they're still working on the implementation, because we go back and forth with them. And then they don't answer for like x amount of hours. 

And they're like halfway around the world. So then the time zones are all screwed up. So we're trying to figure that out. 

We have applied to KuCoin. I'm going to pull that up today. We we also just like, like, looking at what we else we applied to, we applied to BitMart, replied to bithoven, applied to gate.io applied to KuCoin. 

But they're seeing like such an increase in volume, so many different applications that it just takes time. So those are coming, let's take your time. And again, I should be coming back to you.

(12:53 - 14:08)
Coin gecko. Coin gecko. Um, that's like, that's like my least favorite word of all time now, because I literally talk to coin gecko all the time. 

And I'm like, just post us. I'm actually gonna call them up again tonight. I probably have the number on frickin speed dial, because they're a bunch of pain in the asses. 

Because coin market cap happened like what a week ago, I think it was last Wednesday. And then coin gecko was like, Oh, we're gonna come right after it coin gecko is a bunch of lizards. That's why the coin gecko because they're a bunch of lizards. 

And exactly Tiger King. And it's just it's so god dang annoying. And that's the biggest thing we should be what's the biggest thing we should be looking forward to, in my opinion, you, you are going to see and you are going to be ecstatic. 

And like I said, if the news that's that's coming within seven days, it went Robin Hood, I imagine if the news that's that's that's that I'm thinking of is going to come doesn't blow your socks off, then then you can can make me run around a football field and shoot me with a paintball gun. And that'll be fine with me. And it's gonna blow yourself, you're gonna have no socks left. 

I can't tell you guys. But you take me up on that one. Yes.

(14:09 - 14:37)
Wait, is the fucking is that it's a bet. It's a bet. You'll fly up here you can shoot me with a paintball gun. 

You can you could bury me in the backyard and I can act like a carrot for 24 hours. You could do whatever you it shit your pants kind of excitement. Buck, shut up. 

He said so nothing. No, it's a huge thing. I can't give you a hint. 

I can't. I'm from New York. Actually, yeah, well, man, you might actually shoot me with paintballs because I live in New York as well.

(14:37 - 16:05)
We're actually gonna be shitting our pants like Biden. Yeah, but, hey, we got to keep it we got to keep going out there and shilling and I know you guys are absolutely killing it. And we have to keep telling more people about this project. 

Because that's what it's coming down to. It's word of mouth right now. It's all we really have had so far is word of mouth. 

Yeah, we've had we've had influencers. Yeah, we've had things like that. But we haven't had that that one big break. 

And that's we're waiting on that one big break. And once we get that one big break, geez, like I don't even I can't even imagine I can't even fathom what's going to happen to the price to the chart to FJB. Because if we think that we're having fun right now, like what we tested some all time highs basically today a little bit short. 

Let's go rev this thing up tonight. We have to let's rev this bitch up tonight. Let's keep this thing going. 

Let's absolutely smoke this thing. We're still hey, we're still on that unvetted list on Pucon, which I love to see because people still look at that. We're number two on that. 

But let's take the Twitter man right after this. Let's take the Twitter, take the Instagram dude, I saw somebody was shilling Amazon like people were buying Let's Go Brandon shirts and sunglasses. And they were in the comment section shilling us. 

And I've actually never seen more dedication than that, which is awesome. It's fucking awesome. Let's keep shilling on YouTube. 

Let's keep shilling on Instagram. Let's keep shilling on everything that we have. Because it's literally the most important thing.

(16:06 - 16:10)
Click the tweet, Tim. Tim Pool. Yeah, wait, I thought Tim Pool went on today.

(16:11 - 16:41)
I thought people went on to Rogan today, unless he's going on tomorrow. Does he go on tomorrow? Do you guys know? Tim's on? No, no, it's on Joe Rogan. But we're, but we've we've talked about we've talked to. 

What's his name? We've talked to Tim Pool has mentioned us, which is awesome. I heard it might be Sunday for now, Rogan. But I know it's I know it's not. 

I know it's not live. But Tim was on Rogan tonight, probably airing tomorrow. Yeah, you know what? We're shit tonight.

(16:41 - 16:46)
We're shilling at Joe Rogan. And we're shilling at Tim Pool. And we're gonna get this thing going.

(16:47 - 18:06)
We're gonna have them if they mentioned us on Rogan, I'll shit. But we tweeted them enough. And if they're in a conversation, and they keep saying their Twitter notifications, and then things blow up, what is it comes out on Sunday, right? Whenever whenever he comes up, it's going to be fucking fantastic. 

Because if he could talk about that, it's going to be absolutely tremendous. So let's I'm going to write up a tweet for us. We're going to shill the shit out of the tweet. 

And then we're going to tell our mom to shill the tweet. And then our mom's mom is going to shill the tweet. And then all of our mothers are going to be shilling tweets. 

We have so many tweets going about us, it's going to be amazing. But we wrote to all time high end voice chat listeners. Really? Oh, and the cameo we're still waiting on that we still have. 

Yeah, there was the 13 hours left. I asked for an extension because I'm like, we need it. We need it. 

So I got a 24 hour extension. cross my fingers that he frickin looks at the cameo. Any new donation news? Not yet. 

I do like the idea of the 30 days I've actually been calling different donation places and trying to figure out things. They're doing a lot of different donations for Thanksgiving right now. So maybe we'll incorporate a nice like Thanksgiving thing. 

I just was cameo. They haven't gotten back. I know I bought some cameos. 

They haven't gotten back to me. But I'm going to do that one too. Does Trump know about us? I friggin hope so.

(18:06 - 21:01)
You know? Why is it to do? What else is that hostage is good for Crowder? Yeah, so I'm going to write up a tweet right now. I was just reading chat for a second. I'm gonna write up a tweet right now. 

We're gonna go show at Joe Rogan. We're gonna go show at Tim pool. And we're gonna get this thing on the road, you know, and it's been on the road. 

We're just gonna on the road double on the road. And we're gonna be on so many roads. It's going to be fantastic. 

We're gonna have every single avenue that's going to hit this thing. Brian foreigner is working on things for us behind the scenes, fucking amazing things. And he is going to blow the socks off of whatever he's doing. 

Because he he'll just call me he called me like what four or five times today. He'll just call me back. Hey, I'm doing this, this, this. 

And I'm like, hey, go do it. You know, you know exactly what to do. And once he does that, I'm like, man, this thing is perfect. 

Because he knows social media tremendously well. He knows the Republican space tremendously well. And he is going to absolutely kill this for us. 

And I couldn't be more happy to have him part of the team. And like I said, we're building the monsters. And he's our point guard. 

And that is the real deal. Because we have a great point guard in Ryan, because that guy knows how to speak. Okay, knows how to get to people. 

That guy knows how to advertise for us. And the people that we're talking to today meet him on the phone, or some real deal influencers that are going to get us doing some rollout. So I'm actually have a meeting with them tomorrow. 

I don't know the time I have that in my calendar. I have a meeting with them tomorrow about that. I can't wait for that because we can get something going for this weekend. 

We just need a lot of motivation and a lot of momentum going into this weekend. We got to keep the marketing going. We got to keep everything going. 

And we're going to put our foot on the gas into Thanksgiving break. Because once Thanksgiving hits too, this thing is with everything that's going to be coming out and you guys, everybody at home, talking to their families about this thing and extended family and their extended family, then that one weird uncle that shows up with a cowboy hat on, it's going to be unfucking believable. And we are not gonna let up exactly big black jiggity jack. 

We are not going to let this thing up. We are just getting started on this thing. And let's keep revving up the shills. 

Let's keep revving up everything. And hey, let's keep going, man. We have this is day 26, I believe day 26. 

And we've done an unbelievable job so far. And it's only getting better. And I there's so many things in the works. 

probits coming now, Friday 1am. So I don't know how many hours it is to now. That's fine. 

It's a 24 hour delay. Basically, that's okay. We're still getting on probit. 

Everything's all squared away with them. Can't wait for that's a new, new exchange going to boost this thing up. And we have some big things coming. 

I'm doing meetings on meetings on meetings. I wish I could tell you I wish I wish you could read my mind. But we're doing this thing, man.

(21:01 - 21:51)
And this coin is not stopping for anybody. And I'm looking at it right now. We're gonna we're gonna smoke these all time highs. 

And I can't wait. I have such a good feeling about it. I have because I have a good feeling about this community. 

I believe this community. I trust in this community. And I wouldn't want to go to bat for anybody else. 

And I wouldn't want to work with anybody else. Because this is not my coin. This is our coin. 

We've everything that we've built is on you guys. Everything that we've built. You guys have done absolutely everything. 

It's this coin will be nothing without the 6200 holders and the five almost 4000 5000 people in the discord and 3000 people in the telegram that are talking in this thing all day long to talk about random things. You know what I mean? It's and it's I didn't go commie on you guys. It's ours. 

It's ours. We have to pump. We have to pump this thing up.

(21:51 - 22:30)
Nobody's gonna give us a nightly dump. Because if you guys are giving us a dump now, I'm not saying anything, but you're just a silly move. And I thought the number one rule tonight was no silliness. 

I think the number one rule all the time is no silliness. But there are some sillies that are happening. And I don't I don't like the silliness, not given the financial advice that just sillies are just being sillies. 

So we can't avoid the silliness. We're going to show on Twitter. And then we're going to show on Twitter's Twitter. 

We're going to show on getter gab, stock twits, Instagram, Amazon, YouTube, eBay, Craigslist. I'm going to go on Facebook market list and marketplace and start shilling. I'm gonna be shilling left and right.

(22:30 - 24:06)
I'm gonna be shilling on my shills. We're gonna sneak peek at the media website. That is not what I'm working on. 

Currently, I'm working on some other things. Some other people that are working on that can loop you in when when we get some more updates on that. But any China marketing update? Yes. 

China marketing is is already started and still coming. I'm working on some more things with them. We have a Chinese telegram. 

I actually type in it. There's how many people? Two hundred fifty five. I'm going to go message. 

Hey, I'm a Chinese telegram. I want to send a screenshot. I'll send a screenshot what it is. 

I don't even know how to do it, though. How do I do it? These guys are typing left and right. These guys love it. 

Look at these things. They they love this thing. Just send this thing, whatever. 

Look at this. Look at I know it's a horrible screenshot, but look at this. You guys are typing all day long. 

They love it. And I just go, hey, oh, I just I just type in English and they have two hundred and fifty five people in there. And like it's actually like people love it. 

I don't know why they love it so much because they love the freedom aspect of it. And I Google translate. I like I like copy and paste all of the what they say. 

And it's all like, hey, this is awesome. Like we we love the freedom movement. The Let's Go Branded movement is here. 

They're trying to censor it. And we love the fact that you guys are doing this. And people and the Google Translate is just so funny because it transfers over and it's like this is the coin of opportunity or like this coin number one. 

And it cracks me up sometimes, but it's awesome. And I love it. I love that that it's the best thing ever.

(24:07 - 24:21)
This coin is the best thing ever. I couldn't have had a better past twenty six days in the next twenty six days are going to be great. Oh, we're seeing people are typing in the chat right now, shooting messages and stuff like that. 

I love it. The official crypto coin. I love it.

(24:21 - 24:34)
I love it. I love it. I love it. 

All right. I'm going to go post a tweet for us to turn this bitch up and the the announcements. And we're going to go show this and then we're going to show it again and then we're going to show again and we're going to smoke some all time highs.

(24:34 - 24:41)
Why not? Everybody have a good night. Let's pull the roof off the ceiling. Let's keep doing this thing. 

Talk to you.
