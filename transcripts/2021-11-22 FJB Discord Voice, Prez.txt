(0:00 - 0:19)
This is the fucking general chat. Here we go. Here we go. 

Here we go. Let me see how many we got in here. How many we got? Just turn off. 

But if I turn, I'll put on streaming mode and settings. Ha ha. Is that all settings? Let me see. 

Let me see if I do user settings. All right. Let me fucking, let me, let me try to be, let me try to be the, the discord guy.

(0:20 - 2:08)
Oh, streamer mode. Yeah. Fuck yeah. 

Enable. Exit. Dude, if that works, if that works, I'm gonna be to stop. 

But I don't, I don't hear anything. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. 

I'm on voice. Jack ass. So yeah, somebody just that's in here FaceTime me. 

And I said, I'm on voice jack ass, but all right, he's coming. And now I got another person to come. So we got a bunch of people. 

Now we got no Trump on voice tonight. That'd be fucking sick. But let me, let me see how many we got. 

We got one 76 right now. Let's get to one 80. Why not? You know, 178. 

Come on. See no reason why we shouldn't get to one 80. Come on. 

Let's keep it moving. Let's get up a little bit more. Why not? Let's live a little one 79. 

How about one 80? But one 80, we get a little, we get a little excited. One 80. Bring it around town. 

Yeah. One more. Somebody tell somebody else do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. 

All right. All right. All right. 

All right. We got general chat. Hey, don't I do Drew? I only, I remember those. 

I remember we had 50 for the first time and I almost like shit my pants. I was so excited. Now we got one 81 and I'm not even half smiling. 

No, I'm kidding. You're waiting. Yeah. 

All right. So what's going on everybody? Have happy. What is it? Is it Monday night? Yeah. 

Yeah. Cause the bucks are playing the giants, huh? What's going on Monday night, Monday night, Monday night. Today was a very steady day.

(2:08 - 2:29)
Nothing too crazy. Nothing drastic in either way. Take care of brush your hair bisque, but nothing tremendous. 

There was no huge buys. There's no huge sales, which was, it's good and bad, but I look at it like the calm before the storm. And as you guys have been hearing about everything that we're doing, we have a lot of shit in the works.

(2:30 - 4:06)
And I wish that I could come on here tonight and be like, Hey, it's done. Hey, like, Hey, we're all, we're all signed, sealed and delivered and we're moving forward. And we have some huge news still in the works, still really in the works. 

It's every single minute has been, has been working on that stuff, which is good because we have big things coming and I'm very excited about it. And you guys are going to be very excited about it. And I know it sounds like cap or it sounds like bullshit. 

If I keep saying this every night and we haven't done anything, but trust me, things of this matter aren't done overnight. Um, and I think the first time I mentioned this was probably like five days ago and a shit ton has happened in five days. And this is the, not the type of thing that you expect to be done in five days. 

Um, so that's the frustrating part. Um, probate probate is, I'm, I want to show you guys the fricking chat from telegram. Cause it's pissing me off this guy. 

I think cause we, we kind of made fun of him that he's like working very slow now and it's frustrating because he's very slow and he is absolutely pissing me off. And I, I've messaged him. I said, what's the ETI question? Mark. 

I tagged him. He said, please wait. And I messed him again. 

What's the ETI question Mark. And he said, please wait. So I'll, you know what, I'll even show you guys what's going on in this probate thing. 

I think a little snippy. Let me take a little snippy, snippy, snippy. Look, this is what's going, this is my messages. 

Just so you guys know how much we're trying to push this guy. Look at this. This is what's going on with this dude.

(4:07 - 5:50)
I'm gonna message him right now. Again. Hello. 

I'm going to say hello. And then at Esmond, my guy Esmond is really on my last nerves. This is probate. 

This is what we have to deal with. Very frustrating. Not very fun at all. 

So we do it. I've tried to go over this guy's head at probate at probate. I have literally called him. 

I've called, I've messaged his manager on LinkedIn. He's trust me. He's actually kind of high up. 

If you guys pull up his LinkedIn page, I don't want to like put somebody on blast on this thing tonight. But dude, it's like at some point you kind of got to push them and you got to be like, all right, like we need to get this thing going. What's his name? Esmond, Esmond Hui. 

Yeah. He's the head of strategic partnerships. My ass. 

He's the head of strategic partnerships. He's, he's working like he's in slow motion, but I told you, he's got a pretty high up position. So that's the only, that's the only annoying part is like, he is pretty high up. 

I know we got, you got, you catch more bees with honey than with vinegar and we've, I, we have already been mean to him. So I got to stop being mean to him. Which is very annoying. 

Going off of that coin gecko guess we applied two weeks ago. We also applied reapplied again a week ago. I have some connections there that I've been trying to push. 

We were trying to go and they, they blame it on a lot of demand and not that much workforce. But I think that's kind of bullshit. I think they're beating around the bush with us, which is really pissing me off too. 

But that's one they're pissing me off. I don't know. Cause I remember like coin market cap. 

I wish I had the exact date. That's probably 15 days ago, 16 days ago. It's actually, I think Wednesday night. 

Cause I remember that exact night. Everyone was like, oh, we should do this region. Like we have to pay extra to get on there.

(5:50 - 9:08)
And then we just woke up to coin market cap. And the shitty thing right now by coin gecko is just so annoying to get us there. But that'll, that'll come. 

I'm not even worried about coin gecko because everything that we're working on right now is so much bigger than that. We have probit. They should be coming. 

If you guys hear me, I'm getting a little stuffy. I'm getting a little sick, but it is what it is. I'll dominate this cold. 

Don't worry about it. I I've never had Rona knock on wood. I will never get Rona unvaxxed. 

No Rona for nothing. If I had the, if I had the, the, the Ron John surf shop, if I had the miss Rona, I'd smack it around. So absolutely not, not Rona because you want to know why I don't have Rona is because I had an ice cream cone and ice cream cone is the cure against Corona virus. 

And I can't wait till the 60 minutes lady, whatever, Barbara Walters or whoever that is, Barbara Stewart, that white hair lady. She gets me on there and she says, Hey, get me, get me on this thing. I'm going to go talk about the ice cream cone. 

And that's, it's literally what it is. Oh, I just got a text fat out about coin gecko. You need to be listed on an exchange. 

Oh, that's bullshit. Tell probit to hurry its ass up probit and wipe it. We have both of those probit. 

I wish they would give us a time. They got answers once today. And then the second part is wipe it. 

They told that we're waiting. They're giving us an official ETA tomorrow. Preliminary was last week when we paid for it, which was not cheap. 

Um, and we paid for it and they said it was going to be this Thursday, which I thought was perfect, right? For Thanksgiving. Awesome. Like a lot of people at home, you go to see your cousins. 

They haven't heard about the coin yet. You say, Hey, I'm an FJB. You got a sick president. 

It's awesome. Uh, and then they buy it. It'd be sick. 

You know what I mean? So that's what's going on with the exchanges. Wipe it probit. You guys know just as much as me. 

I'm pushing them like motherfuckers. I've been calling them left and right, left and right. Very annoying, very annoying, but it's all right. 

Um, all right. So those are those two. What else we got going on? So in the meantime, while we're waiting on the big news, because that's the big dog that we're waiting on and these exchanges, what we did is we just bought a shit ton of coins, Zillow ads. 

So like, you know, like those poo coin banners and stuff like that. Uh, you know, like I'm going to pull up like an exact someone poo coin right now. And like, if you go over here and you get a little dancing shit, believe it or not, like, I don't believe it. 

I didn't, I didn't believe it at first, but like, if you're on poo coin and you see like this shit, I'll copy and paste it in here. One sec, one little second. I'm cursing too much tonight. 

I need to stop with the cursing, but you see this, like these little dancing ads, I put that in, in the, in the, let's go in the fricking chat that we just got one of those ads. It's going to do a little dance. It's going to flash. 

It's going to do all that stuff. That's awesome. That's really all that's going to bring a tremendous, you guys don't believe how much volume that's going to come. 

That is going to bring us a shit ton of volume. And so that we just paid for that tonight. It wasn't cheap, but that's going to work, dude. 

When we got unvetted on, on poo coin, I think we like doubled our holders. We only have like 1500, but we like doubled our holders in 24 hours because people legitimately trade strictly on that. And if they see that, then they'll look at the chart and be like, dude, if you look at our chart, it looks very technical.

(9:08 - 9:45)
It looks awesome. Then people hear about our community. It looks tremendous. 

Things are great. So, Hey, we have all the makings to be a varsity athlete right here. We're we're good. 

We're doing great. Um, so the poo coin thing, that coinzilla thing is awesome. We also have, uh, I think it was mentioned before, but I just wanted to tell the whole public of what's going on with, with what we're doing. 

Uh, we have a whole, whole, whole, whole bunch of, Oh, so, so that poo coin ad to backtrack, it's coming out tomorrow. Those things are all going to run it tomorrow. It's the coinzilla. 

So coinzilla is not just poo coin. It's a whole bunch of ads. It's a whole bunch.

(9:45 - 10:16)
That's completely directly targeted to these traders. It's targeted to these traders, which is perfect. So that's going to be awesome. 

We have gateway pundit article confirmed for tomorrow. We, we, we bought one of those two. Awesome. 

The coinzilla is 10 sites. Um, just wanted to reaffirm that 10 different sites that we're getting off. That's a lot of volume, a lot of volume. 

Um, these ads are rolling out tomorrow. Like I said, awesome, awesome, awesome. Um, and then that, that gateway pundit ad is going to be awesome.

(10:16 - 10:57)
We're working on Breitbart, uh, working out a bunch of different stuff in terms of the articles itself. So the marketing in the, in the meantime is awesome. It's really great before we even get on exchange. 

We might have 8,000, 9,000, maybe even 10,000 holders. Imagine that. Imagine having 10,000, if you could name another coin that has 10,000 holders without being, without being on an exchange, I will shit a brick because that's not true. 

It's impossible. Because nobody has a community like us. What else we got going on? So if you guys saw the horrible thing, the absolutely horrible thing that happened in, um, in Wisconsin, I spoke, I was speaking to our team and we want to do a donation directly to a family there.

(10:57 - 14:02)
We want to donate $15,000. I was looking, I couldn't find a verified GoFundMe. I don't trust the GoFundMes. 

If you guys can find somebody specifically, if you guys can find somebody like that, we can do that. Hey, I would 100% want to donate the 15,000. We are 100% doing that directly to a family. 

Um, it's, it's horrible. It's horrible. What happened? The world is a horrible place. 

And I'm just very glad that we have people like us, um, to, to take over that. So if you guys can hit me up with a link, um, on how to donate, you guys can find me somewhere or a personal Facebook page. I looked up a story before, um, as a grandmother, she had, uh, three grandchildren really wanted to do donation with them, something of that matter. 

Um, but we want to do that 100%. So, so let us know please about that. Um, so please, please, please, uh, somebody send over a link, a Facebook page, something of that sort. 

I'm going to be looking tonight after I hop off this as somebody we can donate to. And I really, I really, I really want to donate to personally. I just got to actually a couple of messages. 

So hopefully one of them is, um, something regarding this, which is awesome. Uh, I really hope so. I really do. 

And yes, I'm seeing your messages about the crypto moon shots. I'm, I clicked on it right here. I'm clicking on the link and then I'm going to post this after that. 

So if we, if we go on this, we upvote, we all have to upvote. Do we have a lot of comments on it's awesome. Um, this is, this is the, this is the post, correct? Uh, the one that you just said, uh, Waila, A W BLA. 

You're always in here talking, but I, I, I never know how to pronounce your name. Um, so is that the one right here? Is this, is this the, uh, this is the one that has sent it in there. This is the one we should upvote because a couple of people sent me some stuff. 

Okay. Thumbs up. I'm going to post that after I finished this voice tonight, everybody in here has got to upvote that every single person in here has got upvote. 

Um, what else we got going on? So the BitMart and the Bittrex meeting, we had both of those today. One of them was a phone call. One of them was a zoom call, both with the cameras off and just voices working on the contractual stages of that. 

So that's moving in the right direction. It's good. We're doing that. 

We got probit and wiper bit coming out right now. Focus on a couple of exchanges at a time. Also, when this news rolls out, I know you guys probably think I'm a broken record, but when this news comes out, it's it's the exchanges are not going to be an issue. 

So you guys shouldn't be worrying about that because, and I just saw a bar leak post. These exchanges take time. It's not like it can happen. 

It's not like you can just apply. We applied to like Q coin, like three weeks ago, we applied to all of those sites off the jump. And then it takes a while for them to get back to if they even get back to you. 

So DC, I'm not currently in DC, uh, planning on, I was supposed to go down tonight. We got pushed a little bit. Um, so we're still working on that. 

That's the deal that we're still trying to get, get done. Um, working on that. Wanted to answer that donation of this shield that, yeah, this coin, this coin is about helping at the end of the day.

(14:02 - 14:41)
And, and we've, we've proved that we've, we've been focusing on veterans, but as you've seen, we've donated to a bunch of different things, eating disorders. We donated, uh, to Alzheimer's. We donated to breast cancer. 

We do a, we're donating to everything. We're, we're just a coin that helps people. We're not, we're not just sticking to one thing. 

Uh, we're not a fraud organization. We actually have been donating a tremendous amount. So let's just keep doing that thing. 

Let's keep doing that. Can we get a go fund me where a community can donate to? That's a great idea. I'm actually going to get somebody on that. 

That's a really, that's a really great idea. How nuts would this news be? This news will be nuts. It will be, it will be like nuts for nuts in New York city, you know, like those, the nuts for nuts, it'll be, it'll be bigger than that.

(14:43 - 14:52)
Um, which is awesome, which is absolutely awesome. Um, love that idea though. But the, the, the go fund me, if somebody wants to set that up, I'm gonna, we could work together.

(14:52 - 15:15)
We'll hop on a call, figure that out. If anybody's experienced with the go fund me, I've never, I've never done that with a go fund me, but the thing is it'll be like a private go fund me for us. And then as we started to advertise more, we can do that. 

That'd be, that's a great idea. It really is a great idea. But yeah, I heard, I heard go fund me kind of sucks. 

I heard that sucks. So let, let us know a different site. I saw like give and go or something like that.

(15:15 - 17:25)
I've never done, I've never set something up like this. Give, send, go. That's supposed to be a good one. 

All right, good, good, good, good. So I think some people are sending some shit now, but uh, if I'm most excited, uh, yeah, absolutely. Oh. 

And then the logo shows up and pancakes. Yeah. We've applied for that a bunch of times. 

You messaged that. And I know you guys are reacted to it. They still haven't fucking even answered to us. 

It's like, everything is so slow in this world. It's so unbelievable. And it's so frustrating because things in the crypto world, like a day, it feels like a month. 

And then when you apply for things, it's like, it feels like six months. You know what I mean? Um, yeah. So big things going on there. 

Um, let me see what else is going on the other channels as I'm, as I'm looking, I think some people type no, no, no, nothing there, which is good. But yeah, man, absolutely. We were working on a shit ton of things. 

Like I said, just to recap, if I'm, if I, sorry, if I'm not as juiced up, um, I can, you can't imagine how little sleep I've been getting, but I guarantee everybody else has been getting little sleep too, because we're all working hard for this thing. We all want this thing to go crazy. Um, but we have that coinzilla thing coming tremendous. 

Cannot wait, cannot wait at all. That's going to be 10 different sites targeted to people that trade these. Um, so we're going to see a lot of transactions. 

We'll see a lot of volume, a lot, a lot, a lot. Uh, speaking of that, we just had a, we had a tick-tock meeting tonight with the people that run conservative tick-tocks. Uh, they run a bunch of accounts. 

So we, we met with them tonight, um, trying to get something going, something rolling out. Like I mentioned before, there's that the party in Phoenix, Arizona, it's the grand young party, 2000 conservative, young conservatives are going, you're sponsoring that thing. That's December 19th. 

Just to recap from last night. And then we're also, uh, we haven't signed the papers, but we're going to be sponsoring turning point USA with like the big names there. Like Ryan's going to be there. 

Of course these are, he's our guy, but Ted Cruz is going to be there. Charlie Kirk is going to be there. Candace Owens is going to be there. 

And, and I'm going to be speaking up there. Like I'm, I don't know if you guys are going, if you guys can watch it somewhere, but I'm going to get a five minute speech up there. So imagine, imagine we, I'm going to connect the discord to that, but that'll be my live that night.

(17:25 - 18:09)
It'll be, it'll be me talking up there actually. So very excited to do that. I don't know if it's open to the public. 

I'm going to get back to you on that. I need to go talk to Ryan. Ryan's like co co-chair of the board is Ryan in here tonight, actually. 

And I won't ask him to come back up here. He was up here last night, but like, if somebody has that lineup, I know that somebody was sending the lineup before about what it looks like. Send that line up there and somebody fucking somebody out. 

Ryan is grinding a hundred percent, but somebody Photoshopped my face on there because I'm, I'm speaking. I'm, I'm up there. Fuck everybody else. 

No, I'm kidding. Don't fuck everybody else. I love everybody else there. 

It's a great cause, but I'm speaking. And they didn't mention me. Are you kidding me? I'm taking out, I'm taking out six whoppers on the stage.

(18:09 - 21:15)
I'm putting them on, I'm putting them like, no, I'll put like cheeseburger Eddie and, and, uh, the longest yard. We've got the fries that'll cross your eyes. I got the, I got the burgers. 

I just got burgers. I'm taking out the burgers. I just got burgers. 

And I'm just going to start scarfing them down. I'm going to start open up the paper up there. And what my five minutes is just going to be me eating. 

I'm not going to say a word. I'm going to go up there and just dominate McDouble's. I'm not going to say a single word. 

And it's going to be the microphone right up to my teeth and I'm going to grind them out. And I'm going to say, and then at the end, I'm going to eat every fricking McDouble I can eat. And I'm going to say by FJB and I'm going to walk off the stage. 

That's what I'm going to do up there. All right. So that's basically what we got going on today. 

That's what we're doing. That's what we're working on. I'm about to go send that. 

Um, let me throw this up here. Thank you, Barley. You're posting some, some great knowledge in here. 

Material news is pending. It's pending. Thanksgiving is this week sucks. 

Cause I hate, I love Thanksgiving. Don't get me wrong. It's my favorite holiday. 

You watch football, eat all the fucking food you want. You have a, you have a Turkey sandwich at 10 PM and you fall asleep. It's unbelievable. 

Uh, so it's, it's the best holiday, but it's the worst part right now. Cause we're trying to get something done. It's like, Oh, Thanksgiving, people are traveling, fucking every, everything's getting crazy.

Because look at what we're doing. We have those coins, illa poo coin ads that are rolling out. We talked to tick tock influencers. 

We're going to be donating to the Wisconsin family, what families, uh, whoever we can help. We also have probate white bit coming this week. We have a gateway pundit article and a bright Bart article coming out tomorrow. 

I, the gateway pundit is confirmed for tomorrow. The ads are confirmed for tomorrow. Um, I'm going to be forgetting some stuff. 

I've already been saying the turning point USA and the grand young party sponsored by FJB. Um, dude, so many fucking things. It's like unbelievable on unbelievable. 

And it was kind of like a low key day. It was kind of like a, like a stagnant day. But dude, once we get these ads going and shit like that, it's flying, absolutely flying. 

All right. But, uh, unreal, right? Has 34 unreal on, on real dude. Uh, so many things behind the scenes. 

So many things, big, black, jiggity Jack, change your profile picture. What, what is that? He changed his profile picture. I'll represent our crew.

So right there, turning point USA. Oh, there we go. Now we're talking about the wiener either president Brandon. 

He's somebody there was a congressman. There's Candace Owens. There's Ted Cruz, Tucker Carlson, president Brandon, Charlie Kirk. 

Add me in that thing. They're going to love it. Oh, I can't wait.
