I don't have any crazy updates, I hope you all have a great, safe Labor Day weekend. Let's get to it. So the website is looking amazing, our website graphics were completed this weekend, so that's great, and our website is almost complete, at least for this transitioning time.

So that's great, should be ready to go live probably this week for you all, so that's pretty exciting because then we could actually have a website to send to any vendors we're reaching out to and any partners under our new name, PatriotPay, so exciting stuff there. We are still waiting on the third party to start, they have not started yet. The last update I received was that the employee I was speaking to is waiting on his boss, so I will keep you all updated, if that does happen before the next voice chat, I will post an announcement when they do get that started, if it happens before this week.

The dev is still working on the work for one of our partners, he was supposed to complete that last week, but it's taken a little bit longer than expected, so I'll keep you updated on that. It should definitely be done this week, because that's what he's thinking. Other than that, I don't think I've received any questions.

Thank you for the person who reached out to Pat, we did try a few things that the team wanted me to try out with him, of course, unfortunately, they didn't work, but we got that out of the way, so if we do find fixes before the devs get everything completed, then I'll definitely let you know. Please remove your coins off XT, if you have not done that yet, if you're having any issue doing that, please tag or DM me, so we can get you taken care of. We should be close to getting our funds out of XT, as far as the team funds.

Let's see, the last update they gave me was on Saturday, saying within the next 7 days, so I'll keep you all updated on that. Anything else? This is, I believe, regarding the third party's work, is the 10 day timeframe a contractual obligation, or can they put off any work further?

That's just the time they gave us, but it's not a contractual obligation, and they have not started yet. They did tell us this month, well, the last, this month, like the 4 weeks, about 2 weeks ago, they said it was crazy for them, but again, I will keep you updated on that.

[Speaker 2]
Ross McGrand, who's that? Okay, well, hi Ross.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, anything else?

[Speaker 2]
Please?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I think I saw in the chat, you said people were getting confused on if we're going by the name FJB or Patriot Pay. I'm confused, can you break it down on how both names are being utilized to me? So, we are moving away from FJB and moving towards Patriot Pay.

This is mainly because we had such a hard time with getting any sort of partners or vendors, even getting into events just to sell merch and gift cards, and this was before the gift cards, so it's not anything even crypto related, but even, you know, we noticed even conservative websites and events, really anybody in the conservative world just did not want to be associated with FJB. So, that's what we're rebranding towards. We do believe that will help us tremendously to be, you know, to have our name stand for what we stand for versus, you know, F whoever.

I think we all agree, I think most people agree with FJB, they just don't want that at their events or on their websites, which is completely understandable. At the same time, I think he's, I mean, the guy's senile or kind of way past him and that's going to be out where we're trying to build more of a long-term project. So, I think Patriot Pay will work a lot better for us and for several reasons.

So, we are moving completely as far as the website app, Patriot Pay, of course, the coin, you know, on the ticker being FJB, but that doesn't need to be on, you know, the ticker, that's not, you don't really see the ticker everywhere, so to say. So, I hope that answers that, but we are definitely moving forward with Patriot Pay and I think that'll help us in growing the community versus FJB. Any way to get them to move along with tasks, give baskets, etc.?

Sure, you guys can send them nudes and I will, I was going to say I'll forward them, but no, I don't want that, please. So, I don't know how you'd send those directly. CPAC on the list of in-person events we plan to be at?

We will try to be at any event we get approval at. We are very excited for that and nothing is off limits, well, you know, within reason. Was the 10 days how long it would take before third parties started from documents signed or how long it takes them to fix it?

No, it's 10 days from when they start and they have not started. I will let you know as soon as they do start. Like I said, the last I got from them was that this guy is waiting on his boss to give him the green light and give their engineering light the green light.

Is the coin name changing to Patriot Pay for when searching the coin name on Coinbase CoinGecko? That would require a fork and the full relisting fees. So, when we fork, we will have that coin name changed.

For now, no, but once we do fork, absolutely. We will move away from FJB. If FJB is going away, what will happen to FJB coin?

Can you clarify? I do not understand. We are using Patriot Pay as the name of the app and the website.

The actual ticker for the coin is still FJB coin because we need to pay full relisting fees and fork to be able to change that along with the Let's Go Brandon coin name. As soon as we fork, we will go ahead and change that with many other changes. I will let you know as soon as that happens.

We eventually will need to fork. I will update you as soon as we do. How does the fork work?

Does the name just change or do we get airdropped a new coin? Yes, when we do fork, the plan is definitely to change the name away from FJB and you will likely be airdropped new coins, I believe. That's how we did it before.

With chain, I'm not sure. We will cross that line when we get there. I will keep you updated on it all.

[Speaker 2]
Everybody else is excited.

[Speaker 1]
It's not even a Friday. It feels like a Sunday to me. I'm ready for my husband to go back to work, get the house back to myself, and then I'm done.

This is too many days and too little space. I don't know how you guys can go on RVs for months and do it. Investopedia.

Cryptocurrency. Forks versus airdrops. Any hints to the chain for the fork?

Once we get there, I will have hints for you. Hopefully away from BNB, but I'm not sure. I imagine that would be a good idea.

I know a lot of you have asked for that. Bannon might be happy too. BNB is the target of shorters right now.

Surprisingly easily manipulated. Also, SKB is hard down on them with the CCP as fork in the near future. Once we get close, I will definitely let you know.

I think that will definitely help, especially with the name confusion too. Make some nice changes out of that though, I'm sure.

[Speaker 2]
Possibilities are endless. I'm waiting for this Tucker interview.

[Speaker 1]
Should I move my coins from the app before the fork, or do you think it just showed up in my app just fine? For example, since I didn't have Smart Wallet off when I bought my funds, don't show up in my Trust Wallet. Will that make it harder to fork to me if I don't move?

No. Once we do fork, you don't need to move your coins off the app. Don't worry about that.

Once we get there, we will update you on everything. There's nothing you need to do on your end. If there is anything you need to do on your end, we will give you ample time and many announcements and emails beforehand.

Definitely don't worry about that. If you do have your coins on XT, please move them probably to a Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Again, if you do have coins on XT, please move those, transfer them out.

If you need help with that or have any issues, please DM me, tag me. I know a few people have emailed not for a while though, but it's been a few weeks, who I've helped get their coins off XT. So please get your coins off XT.

I think quite a bit of you still have coins on LBank too. It's really just safer for you to have them in a decentralized wallet like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. So that's probably a good idea for you to do anyway, but for sure off XT for the time being.

While we're on that, don't send me or any admins or anybody else pretending to be us any money or click on any weird links or your seed phrase. Nobody helping you needs your seed phrase or any money. Don't give your seed to your mom either.

Don't need your mom getting scammed.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, just got Edza tagging Discord. Okay. Anything else?

[Speaker 1]
I think that's everything. I don't see anybody typing. Tag me or DM me if you need anything.

Tag, DM, email if you must. Otherwise, I'll see you guys in general chat. I'll go ahead and post this with a few notes right now.

Again, I will update you with any updates through announcements if I have any updates before the next voice chat on Friday. But if you need anything else, again, please feel free to reach out. I know, I think, is it September 9th?

[Speaker 2]
I think it's September 9th. Oh, the talker.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Alright, I will see you guys in general chat and I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
