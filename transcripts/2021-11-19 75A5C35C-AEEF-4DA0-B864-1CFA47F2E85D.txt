[Speaker 2]
I was on the phone with some lawyers. What is this saying? I'm just reading, sorry.

I'm here, I'm here, don't worry. I'm just reading. I can't read and talk.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, who just brought the music back up here? I don't want the music up here. Get back down there.

Disconnect. Get out of here. We're doing all right.

So then, all right. So let me open up the freaking general chat. What's going on?

So it's always, like I said, when I'm doing something, I was talking to lawyers right now, because we're working on a freaking big deal. And I can't tell you the deal. I told a couple of you guys that have been like voice chatting with me and stuff like that.

But this is unbelievable news. And it's very exciting news. And news is pending.

I can't tell you what's going on, but just know that I've been, if I haven't been as active in the chat, it's because we've been working on this for like a week and a half. And going back and forth. So that's the funniest part.

Because it's like, it's just like, I don't know. If I was myself, and I was in this group. And it will, first of all, the sales look coordinated.

This doesn't look like normal trading. It's definitely not normal trading. And that's okay.

Maybe somebody wants out and they don't like the community anymore. Perfectly fine. That's just what happens.

That's people get tired. People get bored. I guess he wants beer money.

That's whoever sold or he or she. It's a lot of beer money. You can get a lot of beers for that.

But it's definitely not normal trading. It's good to get some people out. You know what I mean?

Which is awesome. But you can see it. And you could see it was coordinated.

You could see that it was planned. And you can see that it's not right. Because they're basically catching their own falling knife.

It's not trading. It's not smart trading, one. And two, it's just kind of silly.

And it's also unethical. Because you're screwing everybody else. Because you're the one person causing the downfall of everybody else.

Which is not good. But the good thing is, it's great for some people that want to get in. That want a better price.

That want more. So it's great in that sense. Things go on discount.

That's what happens. And Donald Pump makes a great point. Oh my.

Dude, my chair. My chair gets me every time. It always cracks.

I always lean. You know what? Oh, this is really leaning back.

I think I'm going to break my chair. If I break my chair right now, I'm done. But every single dip has been eaten up.

You know what I mean? So you know what I'm going to do? And exactly.

Because it's like, how many times. And I always like, in the beginning when this happened. I'm going to do this.

This is what we need right here. This gets the people going. But in the beginning like this, I would stay up 24-7.

And I would watch the chart. And it'd be like 2 a.m. And I would see like a huge Band-Aid be ripped off. And I would be like, Jesus Christ, we're screwed.

And I'm like, oh, no, this is the worst. And I'm freaking out. I'm panicking.

My heart's racing. And we've come back from this like eight times. I don't even know how many times.

And it's always near the weekend. It's always on like Friday. It's always on Saturday.

Today, we're getting a little early. We're getting a Thursday dip action, which is interesting. But it's good for people.

People could freak out. Like I said, zoom out. We're all right.

We're not bad. Don't worry. What are we at?

This is the one-minute chart. Let's go back. I'll pull back the 12-hour chart.

I like the 12-hour chart. Ooh, that doesn't look too good. That's OK.

You know what? I'm going to show you guys the 12-hour chart. Because I like the 12-hour chart.

And it's one of my favorites. I don't know why I like the 12-hour chart when it comes to crypto. But I think it's very valuable.

And look at this. I'll even do a little drawing. We are here, as you can see.

We were here before. And we went that way. You're not going to understand the timeline of what I'm drawing.

But if I'm a guessing man, I'm expecting this. You guys can't even see my screen, which is the funny part. Because I'm just talking to myself right now.

But I'm posting it in the general chat. That's what I'm looking at.

[Speaker 2]
It's the classic chart.

[Speaker 1]
Because that little circle, the circle on the right, is where we're at right now. It's like, ooh, it's the end of the world. Oh, the sky is falling down.

It's like, OK, look at the line where we're at. We're not even halfway to where we were the other night. Remember how everybody was panicking?

And then it's like, ooh, green, green, green, green, green, green, green. Ooh, green, green, green. It's awesome.

That's where we're at right now. So Buckethead, I'm going to show you the chart. Buck sent the picture.

He sent the picture right there. Zoom out. You know what I mean?

It's not the end of the world. And we're OK. We're OK.

I love commenting on these things when people are freaking out. I got people that I know that are calling me. And they're freaking out.

They're going crazy. And it's, it's, it's, it's, everybody panics. And I was panicking bad in the beginning.

Not, not today. But like October 28th, probably, that dip or whatever that was. Or like November 1st.

Yeah, panicking. When was the last one? This was November 11th, eight days ago.

It was a dip. Then we had a couple dips on November 12th. There was a dip for like two days.

And then now today is November 19th. Today is like the first day where I'm like, wow, we are, we are fine, dude. How many holders we have?

I'm pulling up the holders. We have 6,299 holders. Just about 6,300 holders.

We've been a little stagnant today in terms of the holders. That's all right. But the good thing is we have strength in numbers.

We have people. We have a lot of people, which is all right. And things are okay.

Things are all right. Don't be so worried. Don't be so worried.

You heard people saying, people are saying, I don't panic. Imagine bashing TA, then the president's TA. Yeah.

Well, you can bash TA all you want. I, I, again, I'm not giving anybody financial advice or whatever it may be. But I'm just saying like, hey, if, if you're talking about odds and you're talking about this project and you're talking about this coin, there hasn't been a time where we haven't recovered from a dip.

So it's exciting to see because, well, there's an RSI for our coin. That's pretty cool. What's our RSI at?

Dude, our RSI is fantastic. It's tremendously oversold. For real.

That's a funny picture, Great White Buffalo. I should make that my fricking header on LinkedIn or something. I'll move this here.

I'm just finishing up freaking these emails that these journalists and shit were sending. Where the hell is Post Millennial? I gotta text that guy.

I'm going to text him right now. I'll say, where the hell's the article? Is it coming out today?

Question mark. Looking forward to it. I already said that in my text last night.

Him. What a jabroni. I'm waiting for him.

But hey, we're all right, everybody. You know what? I might even eat a frank.

I might even go if I got franks in my fridge. I might not because I've eaten so many franks recently. I might even eat a frank because I'm that excited.

I'm that calm. I'm that all right. Oh, the probit update.

I'll send a picture. We were ripping this guy in the Telegram chat. And it was funny because he was sending this thing.

I kept trying to call him. And he was saying, I'll send the screenshot of what he was saying because he's very silly. I'll send it right here.

I'll post it in the disc code. This is what the freaking, what the boom bot said. He said, please give me some time to confirm.

It's Friday and my devs are off. I said, I understand. But we told 7,000 people we would be live.

We look bad. Everybody is mad at us. These are true things because everybody was mad.

I know because there are taxes. Hence, tests are needed. When can they be resolved?

I need to tell the community. Then he went on to say that, uh, he went on to say, otherwise, hey, Blueface Investor, we're, I just, I've been up here talking about it. Give me a second.

And then I went on to say, we went on to say that he was being lazy, that they should get the people in and they should start talking about it. And let me get, let me get everybody in the freaking, in the freaking telegram. Are you guys on voice with me or what?

Because I'm on voice. And what was I saying? Oh, and then we said that he was lazy.

We said he was being lazy, the guy. And he was like, I sleep less than you. I was like, okay, one, that's a weird thing to say.

And two, you probably don't. And three, I don't give a shit. So that's, that's what I told him.

But yeah, so what do we do today? As you guys have heard from before, I was on the phone with a lot of people today and I'm glad that I don't have to pay for minutes anymore on my phone because my minutes are through the roof and my AirPods, my AirPods died today and my, and my AirPods have never died because they charge in the case. And then like, I went to go plug in the case to charge him and my, my, my case was dead.

And I was like, dude, I just charged these last night. I've been like, I've been fricking talking all day long. So whatever, it's fine.

I've been talking left and right. I even have a little, I have a headset on. I put my headset onto my phone and so whatever, that's all right.

But recap, basically we have huge news pending, like material news pending. It's going to make you rock your socks. It's going to make you shit your pants.

It's going to make you call your boss and say, hey, don't, it's going to be, it's going to be great. So I'm not worried about it. I love this community and I love you guys to death and I love everybody in here.

And if you guys are going to be on for this ride, I am so unbelievably happy that you guys are here and I couldn't be more excited. And if you guys are not, that's okay. That's your provocative.

I'm, I'm, it's not going to sweat. It's not going to sweat me anymore because I know that this project hasn't changed. So as to how soon will we know we'll, we'll know.

Oh, okay. Did not get my previous email. Best record.

Oh, Oh, it's heating up. I got an email from somebody, somebody important. I think it went to my spam folder though.

Cause my email sucks because you want to know why my email sucks. I have an email and when we first did this project, I got an email list and I sent out a blast of emails, 10,000 emails actually to everybody, a bunch of random businesses, just about our coin. And I sent that out and, and I like, I bought my domain from, from go daddy.

And so you get like a Microsoft outlook, like plugin, you know what I mean? It's not Gmail. It's like a, it's like an outlook plugin and they spammed, they banned my account, which is like a piece of shit.

Whoever did that. So they banned my account. So I called them, I called them.

I called them. I've tried to get everything. Exactly.

Let's get the, do my office. I need, I need an office tour. But, oh, I think I said, where I said, discord, hang on 34 people.

We never, yeah. Okay. So then, so then now like my emails, they get really tricky cause then they'll go to junk.

See, like it goes to junk. Like, why does that go to junk? What like, that doesn't make any sense.

Or like I'll send emails and it doesn't go through. Um, yeah, this guy is just a phony. He's just a phony.

He's just, he's like, did my email not go through? I would just say, all right. Oh, my caps lock is on.

Cause I only type in caps lock. Cause I'm excited about life.

[Speaker 2]
I did not see the last email. I still don't see the last email. I didn't think you forwarded it to me.

What is he talking about? Oh, I answered that.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it might have went to spam and I'll, I'll, I'll send the email after all. You guys are all listening to me, whatever. Um, yeah.

So, so somebody asked why the big dip, if you guys are just joining. Essentially, my feeling is this was, was this plan coordinated and, and it could double check and verify. I know we got like Sherlock Holmes in his chats.

I think this, it was multiple wallets that probably sent coins to other wallets and then planned a dump. Um, like I said before, it's just kind of silly because you're catching your own knife. Like if you look at the 12 hour chart, that whole red candle is the same person, or maybe two or three people, all buddies hanging out that are catching their own knife.

So it's like, okay, yeah, you could, one, you can sell and make less profits than you would if you just traded smartly or two. Um, if come through on every promise that we've made, uh, since the beginning, I know there's been ups and downs and I know it feels like you guys have been here forever. And I know that you guys have, uh, feel like, you know, me forever.

It's only been 28 days, but we've come through on every single promise that we've made. There hasn't been one time where we said something and it didn't happen. And that's the whole thing about this project is we've been completely transparent.

You guys know who I am. You guys know everything about it and there's, there's no issues here. We have things that are going through things that are great.

So everything is going fine. There's no, there's no reason, uh, to, oh, he said, oh, he's, I was just getting, I was just getting going to pressure for you.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, it is. We are waiting on them and awesome. Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
So the publication, it was the publication right there that was talking. So they're, they're posting it. You say you got backlogged with the Kyle stuff, which Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty as we guys all saw.

Um, but he said, okay, got it. Awesome. Great, great, great, great, great, great.

So we are doing everything that we can. I'm going back to my, I'm going back to my soapbox now for a minute. Um, before I let you guys go, we have followed through on everything that we've done and we've followed through on every single promise we've made.

Yes, there's been times where we've made promises and the timelines have been off. Sometimes it's not our fault. Sometimes it's probate something.

No matter what, I'll take the blame for that. I'll take the blame for, for timeouts. I'll take the blame for, for timeframes.

I'll take the blame for whatever they may be in terms of your, uh, reason to be upset. That's okay. That's perfectly fine.

I'm not worried about it. That's all right. The thing is, and I've said this before in the chat multiple times, and I've had this before on the voice session is this train is going to leave with or without you, whether you're on the train or off the train, it's going to go and it's going to go very far.

We have everything in place to do it. So it's either you're on the team or you're not on the team. It's either you're in the train or you're off the train.

It's either get on the bus or get out of the way because you're going to get run over if you aren't. So it's either you hop on now or you stay on or you can get off to whatever you want and that's okay because we are not stopping or absolutely not stopping for nobody. The things that we have lined up are so tremendous and so exciting that the people that are selling now or the people that want out, that's okay because they're going to look back in a week from now and say, I'm a jackass.

They're going to be sitting on Thanksgiving day or on Black Friday or Cyber Monday or Christmas day and saying, I'm a pussy. Why on earth would I sell when this happens? So that's okay.

They could do that. It's fine. We don't need them.

But it's either get on the bus or get out of the way because we're not stopping for anybody. Go out there and chill and let somebody else that doesn't know about this project, let them know what this is. Let them know how great this community is.

Let them know what we're doing and let them know how high we're going to go because there's no fucking limit to this. So get out there and chill and let's keep going. Have a good night.
