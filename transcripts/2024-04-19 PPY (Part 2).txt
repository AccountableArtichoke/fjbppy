(0:12 - 0:28)
Hmm. Hello? What is going on? That's so weird. Even my recording said a pop-up, so it stopped.

(0:29 - 1:44)
Weird. Sorry about that. I wonder if something's going on. 

They keep messing with the Wi-Fi in my neighborhood. Okay, so if anybody has a BNB in their smart wallet that they transferred out successfully or even saw it, please let me know. Okay, great job. 

Probably. Probably will be. I don't doubt that. 

Yes, thank you. Yeah, if you had a BNB in your smart wallet, please reach out. I don't know. 

I feel like I'd trust the Chinese more at this point. I'm not sure. I'm not sure who I'd trust.

(1:45 - 2:39)
Okay. Anything else? So, remember to please move your funds out of smart wallet. If you know anybody that had smart wallet funds, make sure to get those moved out ASAP. 

If you can do it by the end of this weekend, that would be great. I will post a few more reminders, and then we'll send an email. Again, we will have a link for you all to access those funds, but we really would like to move on sooner than later.

(2:45 - 4:54)
Any questions and emails? I have only listened to the sports show. Will the team allow us to see if we have smart wallet FJB in our other accounts and app? Oh, you mean from when you used to be able to rename your accounts to start a new account? Please DM me if you haven't. If you have, then disregard. 

It looks like I'm quite behind on telegram DMs. Hi, Mike. When you eat a bug, will the yacht party accept FJB tokens at the bar in lieu of fiat? We'll accept PPY and possibly our new Reflections token.

(5:25 - 7:40)
So you can start a yacht PPY wallet. And then when you have the weekly buy reminders in your app, you've got to make sure to throw some in your yacht wallet. Okay, I think that's everything I have. 

We've run a contest tonight. I don't think we did a contest to celebrate the smart wallet. Okay, so that's about a hundred. 

So we'll do... You guys want one winner or two winners for the contest tonight? Let's see, we can run it for 24 hours. Where's the contest tab? See, Discord is so much more organized, I feel like. Let's do 24 hours.

(7:59 - 8:16)
So we'll do a 24 hour contest. You guys want one winner or two? Ed says one winner. Okay.

(8:25 - 8:52)
Does Tucker Carlson Network have a Discord? Yeah, he should. I'm pretty sure I've seen it somewhere in my list. Okay, so you guys want to do two... I was going to split them up between two winners, but nobody else answered but Ed.

(8:56 - 9:02)
Oh, sorry, I misread that. You said on Discord. I was thinking you said Telegram.

(9:23 - 9:36)
We'll do buy each hundred K, PPY. What the heck. We'll do win 500 then for doing one winner.

(9:37 - 11:14)
We'll do it for 24 hours. It'll be till 9.30pm Eastern tomorrow. That works. 

All previous winners have been paid out, so... Let's see. Post it on Discord, I guess, if you guys will allow it. There we go. 

All right. Got the contest going. If we buy 200K, is that two entries? Yes. 

Poor Stacey. You guys gave her a run for her money. Went through and counted. 

I think last time we had almost 500 entries. Will Tucker accept PPY token for subscription? You know? You never know. All right.

(11:26 - 11:47)
You guys can write him. Write him and ask. Dog bone sick. 

400,200. 4-0-0-2-0-0. P-P-Y.

(11:49 - 12:04)
Hi, Voodoo Child. Oh, what is that? Is that... I can't read that. I was trying to read that.

(12:09 - 12:26)
Hmm. If I buy 10K, is that one-tenth of an entry? Yep. But if you do 10 10K burns, I think Stacey will probably make sure you don't win.

(12:36 - 13:01)
It does look like that kid needs a diaper. Yeah, I think that's everything. It doesn't seem like... I imagine Russ is not online since I don't see a bunch of buys for the contest yet.

(13:07 - 13:18)
Dennis. Almost everybody here. I see the usual crowd.

(13:25 - 13:31)
All right. Reminder. Don't share your personal information with anybody, please.

(13:31 - 14:11)
If somebody DMs you a profile that looks like mine or like any of the other admins or just like another member, you know. Russ is DMing you, asking you for some personal information or for you to send him some money. It's probably... Oh, how cool. 

There's a Roadrunner in my front yard. Wow, he's gotten fat. But, sorry, sidetracked. 

I saw from the corner of my eyes something huge. It's so cute. I don't need any more burns, though.

(14:12 - 14:28)
Don't worry, I will not go out to get him. So anyway, if anybody that looks like my profile or the admins or any other users, please be very wary. It's very likely somebody in here is not asking for your personal information or for you to send them money.

(14:29 - 14:55)
You guys are usually pretty good if it's somebody new, if it's some new profile. Like, I forget, what was it? Jennifer or some lady a few days ago that was trying to send some scammy DMs. You guys caught it pretty quickly, but I think a lot of the times that scammers have successfully scammed users in here is when they make profiles that look like some of the admins.

(14:57 - 15:08)
So just be wary of that. Again, please always double check in the general chat. Just better to be safe than sorry because they seem to always get you on a day that you're not feeling too well.

(15:08 - 15:19)
And that's why people have fell for it. Other than that, don't click on any weird links and enter your information. I know that's happened too.

(15:19 - 15:31)
And don't download any weird apps. Sometimes, you know, I think somebody, what was it? Like, download a quick swap app. And quick swap does not have an app, so it's a scammy app.

(15:31 - 15:44)
Sometimes the Apple App Store and Google don't catch those. So just be very careful there. Remember to move your Smart Wallet funds out.

(15:44 - 16:05)
And let anybody you know that you know has the app or any Patriot Pay. Because you don't know, you know, if you told them to buy FJB on Trust Wallet, they could have came in one time and seen an announcement and downloaded the app and bought some more on there. So anybody that you know is a holder, let them know.

(16:07 - 16:20)
But I think that's all. You know, if you want to enter in the contest, go ahead and enter there. Let me know if you have any other questions.

(16:22 - 16:32)
We will get all reimbursements again. If you have Patriot Pay in your Smart Wallet, please do go ahead. Transfer out to a non-Smart Wallet account.

(16:33 - 16:55)
And then send me either a transaction link or your wallet address. That way we can get you all squared. Oh, that's so cute! A little bunny.

(16:57 - 17:07)
We used to have a ton of bunnies in our neighborhood. And then a bunch of coyotes moved in. In the canal right behind.

(17:07 - 17:23)
And there's not. But now... Yeah, now we have a bunch of squirrels. So we'll see how that goes.

(17:23 - 17:33)
How the dogs will do with that. Okay, I think that's everything. I think it's two recordings now.

(17:33 - 17:39)
Because the first one is weird. I don't know why it did that. The recording stopped.

(17:41 - 17:50)
I will upload both of them. In case you guys want both. I think that's all.

(17:50 - 18:03)
We'll meet again Tuesday, I'm sure. We'll have updates. If I have updates before Tuesday, then we'll do a voice on Monday instead of Tuesday.

(18:04 - 18:22)
Again, from the top of my head, I don't think this company generally works on the weekends. I think they're headquartered in... Well, they're all over. I know one of the owners lives in Texas.

(18:23 - 18:31)
I don't know if that's where they're headquartered at. I'll go check on that. But you all have a great night.

(18:32 - 18:38)
A safe night. And I will get these files converted right now. And get them uploaded.

(18:40 - 18:50)
Yeah, we're still moving forward. So, thank you for your patience. We'll see you in general chat.
