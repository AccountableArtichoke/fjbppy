[Speaker 1]
Hello. Sorry, I had to put my recorder on because now my goal is to put that on before I start, just in case somebody else forgets to record it and somebody else needs it. So, happy Friday.

Thank you for joining me as always. I apologize, I know I'm a few minutes late. It's been a crazy day.

I didn't have as much time to prepare your questions. So, I apologize for that in advance, but we'll still take questions. Oh, let me turn that off.

Still take questions in the chat and I'll answer everything I did get together. I'm pretty sure I have all of them. So, let me get in here.

I'll get in the general chat. Drew has a question. Am I Grant's stepmom?

No, I am still not his stepmom. I don't know if his dad's looking for a wife and he's cute and has his life together. Hey, that might be an option.

I'm married, but you never know. Gotta keep your options open. Don't tell my husband.

I heard Drew is Grant's cousin, true? I'm not sure. I've heard that too, but I'm not sure.

They kind of sound alike. Drew, are you Grant's cousin? I'm not sure.

They kind of have the same accent, but they could just be like from the East Coast. I'm not sure. Will you vote for the Democrat?

What? Why would I vote for the Democrat? Are you insane?

Yes, so I'm Drew's step-aunt, I guess. No. Yes, Bannon and Boris are still involved with this project more than ever.

Awesome, we could be friends because I'm not voting Democrat. Carrie Lake, whoop. Awesome, I'm gonna get started on some questions.

He just wants to know if Boris and Bannon are still involved. Sherlock says that guy should be muted for asking this a thousand times. He's just checking, you know?

I get it. Okay, so let's start with this. This would be very helpful, this user says, it would be very helpful to increase the visibility in the app and to show any health issues with associated services that may cause certain functions to be delayed or halted.

There are examples, there are like transact service availability, change now service availability, and blockchain outages. Great idea, I will pass this on to Velo. I'm not sure how easily this can be done.

I know this was in the plans way back when on the first version of the app, but I will see if this is something he can get done or if it requires a ton of testing. I'm not the techie person here, so we will ask Velo. Okay, next question.

If her opinion matters about coin development, then we should probably see that flow chart for company hierarchy. Again, this has been discussed many, many times, so I'm not sure if like drawing a diagram would help. Is this what we're talking about?

I'm not sure. Spannan, Boris, one of their team members, and me right under, and Velo. That's literally it.

That's as small, big as the hierarchy here. Velo is contracted out, to my knowledge, unless that's changed, I don't think it has. Our marketing, PR are also contracted out.

That's it, just four people officially on the team right now. And hey, my opinion doesn't need to matter if you don't want it to. Third time asking about staking.

Yes, that will be addressed if we add it. It's in the talks right now. Also with tax structure, I think you'll be very happy.

Our new tax structure will be great for the holders, for anybody looking to get into the coin, purchase the coin, I think it will be great. I think you'll be very happy, and I can't wait to share that with you. Let me see, somebody says something is urgent.

When add Dogecoin, so Musk will accept FGB. I think that's actually on Velo's list. I think that's actually pretty high up on priority, with all seriousness.

I don't know if you're joking, but that's actually pretty high up there. Oh, everything old turd coin holder says is urgent, he says. All right, next question.

If the bees are fine with next iteration of white paper, then what is holding it up? A lot of things happening on the backend. We are still in transition in a lot of ways.

It seems like the more things do get handed over, the more things we find. It hasn't been the most organized around here, so just reorganizing everything and making sure we have all accounts ready to rock and roll. I know it's very frustrating, but this is just a part of transition.

I apologize, I'm really sorry. Okay, marketing team, advertising team, assistant, whoever, not update socials with sign of life question mark, who owns access to Reddit account? I believe Jana still owns the Reddit account, so I'm not sure.

We can either make a new one or ask her for those logins. Hey, Drew, do you know Jana on a personal level? Can you ask her for that account?

I will also ask Grant to see if he can get those. So we're in a transition as far as the social media. Once that's completed, the more public accounts like social media will have the passwords changed so that only the new team has them, and we'll restart the party from there.

BNB have a certain vision. There are reasons for their decisions and their strategy. Whether it has to do with everything going on in the country, in the world right now, whether it has to do with their private contract, legal contract and transition with FJB.

I know it's joked about a lot that I'm asking you to trust their plan, and I'm really not just saying that to shut you up. I can promise you that, but I would trust that. There are reasons, reasons that they may not necessarily be able to share with the public, whether that's legal reasons, I'm sure you know, Boris, huge attorney, or just strategic reasons.

That's the reason behind a lot of that. And trust me, I wish I could share that. It would make my life a whole lot easier because then it would make, a lot of this would make a lot more sense to everybody, but the transition and having team members leave has been huge, caused huge changes around here.

Again, I think you will be very happy with the changes, but I'm not gonna lie to you. This is gonna take time, it's gonna take time. I do think it's the best place we've been in a very long time, and I truly, truly mean that because I have never been closer to the project than I am now, but I'm not gonna lie to you and give you a date that's a week or a month that everything's all gonna be great and we're all gonna be back at an all-time high.

It is going to require time. It's definitely going to require time, but I can tell you this is the busiest I've been with FJB since back in December when I was stranded overseas, sleeping two, maybe three hours a night. I truly, truly mean that.

I am not lying to you. I have no reason to lie to you. And again, I know you've heard it over and over, so it seems like, oh, you've said that for a year, but I've never been this close to the project, and unless something drastically changes, I wouldn't be here.

If anything did, I would let you know if I was leaving and what the reason I was leaving is, but I really would take that into account and hope and wish everybody else would. Again, it would be so easy for me if I could tell you everything, because I don't enjoy this. I don't enjoy you guys being unhappy.

I don't enjoy the low morale. I don't enjoy any of that. I like to see you happy.

I'd like my coins to be at near all-time high. Heck, I'd take half of all-time high at this point, but we are getting work done. You know, I wish you could see the results all up front as we're doing them.

I wish you guys had a little gauge that's empty and full, and you could at least see that moving. Maybe that's what I need to do. Maybe I need to make some sort of like gnat chart and do that so you can at least see a little graph that moves or something that fills up, but that's that.

How many apps have coins in it, and how many apps downloaded? I will get that number for you. Actually, let me write that down.

I know we are getting about, last time I checked, last time I checked, so this might not be like this week, but last time I checked, which, excuse me, was a few weeks ago, we were getting about 50 downloads a day. So I will check on more recent numbers, though. And let me get that for Velo too to see how many app updates or downloads we have.

Okay, let me see what else. Any update on compliance progress with Transac? I'll be honest with you, we were supposed to have a meeting this week.

That was moved to next week. So unfortunately, I'm super bummed about that, but that's life. I'll update you as soon as I have an update, hopefully next week.

Somebody says, don't expect all questions to be this good, please. Please. Okay, I think, let me see.

Oh, no, I had one more question, but it was a really long one. So I think, let me see. I think I have to write that one or read that one.

Let me get my drink. I'm trying a new one. It's a seltzer called Neutral.

I don't know, it's supposed to be really healthy. Healthy alcohol, if that makes sense. Okay.

All right, you guys ready? I feel like I'm Dear Abby. I'm gonna read this, okay?

Son, here are my questions tomorrow. Okay, I won't be able to pen. There's some personal stuff.

Okay, my question is, I don't understand Finman's logic with August 2nd. Did he make the decision to go forward and start what he said was marketing without the permission and approval of Bannon and Boris? And when he made the decision to go forward, did he not know the app was, I think they meant far, far from where B&B left comfortable going forward with it?

Okay, so let's answer that one. No, Fin had full approval initially, and I think that may have changed on or very, very close to August 2nd. But he, of course, had full approval.

Fin did nothing without approval, very similar to the way I have done. I don't think I can think of anything I've done without approval. We try to do that.

We are supposed to do that. And Fin did a great job at that, I think. We also have spent, it appears, at least 120K on a marketing PR firm.

Is that money already exhausted or are they on standby waiting to perform for us once app is ready? I'm honestly not sure about that. I know for a fact that that money was paid out.

However, I don't know if those services are still there since a lot of it is we decided to cancel. It wasn't the correct time with the Trump raid. Again, the explanations we were given is that they were going to be asked and to talk about all the Trump stuff instead.

And I'm not sure if that had, you know, kind of legal reasons behind it or what, but that's all we got. And I know you speak with BNB and I get the vibe that they aren't really concerned about this community per se. Oh, I wouldn't say that.

It's honestly not that they're not concerned about this community. I don't want you to think that. But he does say, he goes on to say, they aren't really concerned about this community per se and more focused on the bigger picture.

Okay, true. But do they agree that what transpired with Finn, the promises he made and his involvement with the community is a bad look and would leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth now that he is essentially non-existent. I'm not trying to beat down a dead horse, but BNB had this thing brimming with excitement and now they have essentially lost most of everyone from this community that was on this hype train.

I know you take the coin very seriously, but when Barley, Spesh, Finn and others jump ship, it just doesn't seem, I think, seem like they have faith in BNB anymore. And BNB don't see all the concerns, think concerned, don't see all that concerned in trying to restore our faith. Okay, I think he said, he meant, and BNB don't seem all concerned in trying to restore our faith.

Sorry, I should have looked through typos before reading that. Okay, so no, I think the first, let's get down to the first question. Sorry, that was a long one.

I usually, when I prepare, I usually break these up, but today it's been crazy. So do they agree that what transpired with Finn is a bad look? Yeah, there've been a lot of changes around here.

Finn had it hard from you guys. I get that, and I don't think he was used to that. And I do sympathize with him on that, probably because of the position I'm in is very similar.

And I'm not blaming you guys for that. I understand why you feel that way. I sympathize with you.

I feel a lot of what you feel. And if I didn't know what I know being on the back end, I would probably be just emotional and furious and spectic as you guys are of all of this. But there are reasons, and they understand the reasons that Finn left.

I don't think they blame him. I don't blame him. And again, I think the community was a lot.

You guys are a lot. I appreciate you guys. And I can handle you, but you know, takes a lot some days, some days more than others.

You guys have all been very kind to me. So I appreciate that, thank you. And then his next question was when other team members like Barley, Spash, Finn, and others jump ship, doesn't seem like they have faith in B&B anymore.

I mean, probably, but again, honestly, Spash led, I don't think, as far as I know, to my knowledge, he didn't have any direct contact with B&B. Barley did, but that's been a long, long time ago. And I think other than Grant and Finn, of course, I'm the one that's had the most communication directly with B&B and their teams.

I can see the vision. What can I say? I can, I understand it.

I'm in no way saying I am better than any of these people who have left. They've left to other projects. They've left to other businesses.

I think it just happens to be that, hey, COVID closed my business. So I may as well, like I have nothing else to do. And I do love this community.

And I've built a connection with this community that I really appreciate. So again, not saying I'm better by any means than any of these people that have left or anything like that. I think all those people have businesses.

I know Special Ed had a business. I know Barley had a business. They had other things and families to take care of.

They all had kids. They all, all stuff that, again, I honestly don't have. You know, when my restaurant got shut down, I started trading full-time and that's how I found FJB.

So I think that answers that. Tax was supposed to be lifted during the election, question mark. Oh, I'm not sure.

I must've missed that. Yeah, I'm not sure about that. What do you mean, JL Young?

I'm sorry if I missed that. But there's a lot of stuff that I miss or forget. Okay, any other questions?

Any update on Google? That meeting was actually also moved. I was supposed to have a meeting with BES.

We had one. We were supposed to have another one about the end of the week. And they moved that till next week.

And Velo, I believe, is still working on that. Finn also said the digital airstrike was a success. So take that for what it's worth.

Yeah, I don't think, I truly don't think he meant that. I don't, I mean, I guess he could've meant, I think he misspoke when Finn said that. And hey, I've misspoken too.

I think we all have. Again, I do think the community was hard on Finn and it was a lot to handle. But I will say that the digital airstrike was not a success.

I agree with all of you, 100% agree. Do you know any of the strategies that BNB, that BNB what? I know you can't, haven't said anything.

Like the strategies, I'm assuming that they have in store. Yes, definitely. They are working on that.

They're working on that. It's just, to be completely honest with you, a lot, there's been a lot of things that should have taken, that should have taken place a long time ago that hadn't. Just stuff, you know, getting everything together, organizing everything, that is happening now.

And a lot of that stuff takes a ton, a ton, a ton of time. And because if you're dealing with, you know, you're dealing with Coinbase and you're dealing with a bank and you're dealing all these documents sent back and forth and three to five business days for this and five to seven business days for that. So yes, they do have a strategy.

I cannot wait to share it with you. I am not trying to be secretive. It would make my life a whole lot better if I could share it with you.

But unfortunately, I can't quite yet. We will need your help very, very soon in weeks, I would say, to start planning a lot of it. We will be asking for a lot of your input to get you more involved.

We do value your opinion. And I think we want to, we think, I mean, we owe you that for sticking around for this long. So I think that'll be awesome.

And I really think everybody will be very happy. Sherlock says somebody sent on board that. I'm thinking that the digital airstrike wasn't a success.

I know, it wasn't. I think Ben misspoke when he said that and I think he realizes that. All right, any other questions?

Again, I apologize. I didn't have as much time today to prepare these. So I think I went through all of them.

A few of them were repeat ones, so I didn't repeat those. What is the most recent? BNB Communication, who could share with us.

They did us, they did put somebody else from War Room on the team. They switched out their team members, which should be really great for us. Finn really quick, instead of admitting loss and paying Croc two million, I'm sorry.

Thank you, thank you so much. I appreciate it. I really appreciate the love I receive from you guys.

I appreciate that. Thank you for being kind to me. It does not go unnoticed.

When you say this will take time and you're unable to pinpoint it, a week, a month, et cetera, is this going to be longer than timeframe? Example, three months. Let me think on how to get back to you on that because there is some things in the contract and dates that I would love to share more info, that I'd love to share with you without crossing the line that I'm not allowed to cross, which I think will be great.

But it will be very, very worth it, I promise you that. Has the app seen activity from BTC? And I'm not sure.

I can check, let me add this to Velo's question. I can probably put these in announcements, actually. If you have any questions for, maybe I'll make some sort of thread with questions you have for Velo and maybe we can ask him to do a voice with us if you guys are interested, if he'd be so gracious.

Aw, thank you, Too Relish. I appreciate it. Weg, shut up.

Okay. Life is better when you color outside the lines. Ask for forgiveness later.

Is that towards me? Yeah, I don't want lawsuits. Boris is, man, don't wanna mess with him.

All right, anything else? Yes, Velo is awesome. If you guys want him to join us for a voice, I can go ahead and ask if he would do that again.

I think his last voice with us was amazing and he answered a lot of questions. Let's see, let me make sure none of these DMs. Okay, I have a few questions in DMs. With Airstrike, marketing, interviews, et cetera, people are asking if the money that used is gone. I'm honestly not sure.

I know the money was paid. I'm not sure if it is gone. When B&B have a little bit of time, hopefully after Tuesday, even though, man, I'm not sure, Arizona, how long they're gonna take to count those votes, but I will get this answered.

I'll add it to my list so I don't forget. Okay, more contacts was the money that went into Digital Airstrike. Used, gone, saved, how much?

Oh yeah, I'm honestly not sure, but I will check on that. I think that's all the questions from there. Anonymous question, is Baby FJB going to do anything with FJB?

I sure hope so. I hope so, I think it would be with people talking about, what is it? Ah, goodness, let me look at my list.

Reflections, was Baby FJB was Reflections? Yes, yes, I think so. It's in the plan, we'll make it work.

We'll have more details soon. I think it'll be great. Okay, you're very welcome.

Thank you, I appreciate it. I do appreciate, again, your time. We don't take it for granted.

We don't take you all being here for granted. I know it's been quite the road. I really mean it when I say appreciate it, you guys.

I can't say that enough. Yeah. If you chose to choose Joe Biden or Barack Obama sniffing your hair, which would you choose?

Oh, I don't wanna be neither, near one of those. Neither, see, neither. Yeah, that sounds awful.

Obama was at my college, I don't know, one of the college graduation events, I forget. Yuck, who's gonna ask Sarah what shampoo she uses? I actually use some, I don't know, some medical grade one.

Fun. Awesome, well, it looks like that's all the questions. Please let me know if you have anything else.

Again, I will post, if you guys are interested in doing a voice with Fellow, I'll post something where you can send him some questions in advance. But I think that's it. Thank you for joining.

I hope you have a wonderful night. Again, I really appreciate every one of you. Thank you for still being here, bye.
