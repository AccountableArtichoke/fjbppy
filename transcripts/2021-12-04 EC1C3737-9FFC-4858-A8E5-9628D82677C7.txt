[Speaker 1]
I mean, but everybody, this has been a crypto, I guess you could say it was a crypto flash sale, crypto knife, some people are saying it, but I don't know if you guys saw it, but all across the board, if you watch, fucking Ethereum came back already a little bit. Bitcoin started to come back a little bit. FJB, all the coins are down and that I saw something that some 401ks liquidated like $2.6 billion worth of cryptos and it was getting them down, but hey, I couldn't be more excited about it. So I'll say a couple of things. It comes to cryptos when it comes to stocks, when it comes to anything, if you, or let's say in general, let's say you are at a pizzeria and they're like, a slice of pepperoni pizza is $4. And you're like, yeah, sure, I'll buy that pizza at $4.

I wanna buy that pizza. Go back in two weeks from now, that pizza is at $2. Do you say, I don't want that pizza now because it's at $2?

No, nothing has changed about that pizza. That pizza is still the same shit. So if you're gonna buy it at four, then why don't you buy it at two?

It only makes more logical sense because you can buy more pizzas. Now for the price of one pizza two weeks ago, now you can buy two slices of that pepperoni pizza, a better value and you get more bang for your buck. You know what I mean?

So you can, I'm not crayon said, buy pizza at four. People are, okay, Beretta Vendetta. When you go on a soapbox too, people are like, oh, it's time for the news, time for the news.

Just think to yourselves for a couple of minutes. I posted this in the chat today. I'm not sure if you read it.

Do you honestly think that it would be logically best to drop news with the current conditions? It's a Saturday. One, it's a Saturday.

Do people really give a shit about work and stuff like that on Saturday? No, they have been working all week long. They wanna take a break.

They're not like, they don't have their eyes glued to the computer. They don't have their eyes glued to their phone. They don't have their eyes glued to that.

You know what I mean? Number two, all the coins are down. You don't want to announce huge news when things are dropping.

If you guys have ever seen stocks, it doesn't matter what, if a penny stock is gonna drop that the fact that they have breaking news and breaking data for breast cancer, it's not gonna do much if all of the small caps in the Russell 2000 index is down. It's like throwing a paper towel on a flood in your basement. It's gonna maybe help for a second, but it's not gonna do much.

So one, it's a Saturday. Two, the coin, all the coins, Ethereum, they're all dropping. So you don't wanna just be like, oh, this is the perfect time to drop news, especially at 6 p.m. on a Saturday. You don't do that. Three, we're being very strategic with this marketing blitz. We're gonna come out at the perfect time with all of this news, come out in the most efficient way possible.

You know what I mean? And I can't tell you right now, actually, when it's dropping, because I mentioned it last night about compliance and legal. I wish I could tell you it's an exact time.

And it probably is better that I'm not giving you an exact time because then you guys are gonna be like, oh, well, what time, what time, what time, what time? You know what I mean? And things are always moving, but just I can assure you that this thing is being very strategic and we're figuring out every single detail of it.

And I've said it before, and I'll keep saying it, this is going to be one of the most historic news to ever hit crypto. And it's not gonna be like some bullshit, oh, we've been getting TikToks or, oh, we got a billboard in Times Square or, oh, we got Candace Owens. Like it's not any of that stupid shit.

If you think that, just think for a second, if we're waiting this long and if we have news and we're bleeding this bad in terms of the price, don't you think we would be like, oh, let's drop it fricking 20% ago? We're making sure that everything is perfect. Because honestly, I haven't even checked the price.

I just checked it for the first time tonight when I just looked now, before I was gonna hop on the phone call. You know what I mean? If I was going to be hopping on this, if I was gonna be, yes, a part of the coin and not owning the coin, but I think we all own the coin.

You know what I mean? I think that this is just our coin. But if I was new to the coin and I saw this and I was like, oh, they have news pending.

News is solidified. They're just waiting to drop it. And the price keeps going down.

That sounds like a no brainer to me. That's like, I keep going back to equities because that's what I know. But what does it say?

Please tell us right now that this news is so big we'll hear it in media before even Discord. You guys are gonna be hearing it a lot of different avenues. I can assure you that.

You're gonna be seeing it a whole, whole bunch of different ways. I see the price. Yeah, I see it, TC.

This is not gonna be like, oh, I saw it on, I heard it on Discord. You're gonna hear it from me. You're gonna hear it from a lot of different sources.

It's gonna be a news that amplifies around, around, around, around. Everybody will be hearing this. This is the type of news that people that you don't even know was in the coin call you up and say, oh, shit, did you hear about this coin?

It's not gonna be that penny pincher where it's like, oh, Newsweek posted an article. It's not like that. Why do you think we're waiting this long?

Why do you think we have everything set up? You know what I mean? I know that people are fearful.

Like I mentioned before, be greedy when others are fearful. If the price is this low and I'm not saying buy or sell, I'm not saying anything of that sense, I'm not giving you financial advice. I'm just saying, if you liked something before, then why don't you like it now?

It goes back to the pizza. If you liked it at $4, why don't you like it at $2? You can get a heck of a lot more pizza now.

You know what I mean? That just, it makes logical sense to me. But I'm just coming on here tonight.

Just wanted to give you a quick update. I want you guys to hear my voice. I think that some of you guys do like me talking about it.

I think you guys do like me coming on and doing the voice. We had a good time last night in the general chat, just hanging out, cracking a couple of beers, chit-chatting. WhiteBit's coming on Monday.

Yes, we've seen that, which is awesome. Number two, any hints on the rollout, like where it might be seen? I wish I can give you the full marketing plan, but I think it's better to see it in action than to hear about it first.

You know what I mean? I think surprises are always better. And I appreciate the hell out of you guys for being here because I know if I was sitting in your shoes and if I was somebody that didn't know me and that didn't know the person, yeah, you know my name and stuff like that, but you don't know who I am.

You don't know anything about me. For you guys to have all this trust in me on day 41 and for you to be here this whole time, that's incredible. So one, thank you for that.

But two, if you've been here for that long, then what's a couple more days? It's like, okay, if you sell now, then you're gonna be getting pennies on what could be dollars. You're not really, your risk is so limited and your reward is unlimited.

So your risk is limited, your reward is unlimited, essentially, with this coin, which is crazy. You know what I mean? If you're looking at R&R, you're looking at risk to reward on something, I see this coin being fucking incredible.

I wouldn't be here doing it. I wouldn't waste my time. Don't you think I would have not wasted my time doing this?

Or don't you think that I would be gone or I would be like, oh, maybe like I'm not gonna do a voice tonight or hey guys, I'm gonna take a break or I'm not gonna be as active in the Discord or I'm not gonna be talking to random people, answering DMs. Don't you think that I would have kind of stopped that if I thought that this coin was dead in the water instead of just trying to keep up a fugazi, a facade? That makes no sense. You know what I mean?

Yeah, Jay says he met Prez once. I'm not sure who you are, Jay, but thank you. Everybody is very excited about this news.

Everybody that's involved is extremely excited. Everybody that's around in terms of like knowing the news and the parties involved are tremendously excited because they see the vision, they see the future, they see how crazy this thing could get. And it's coming at the perfect fucking time.

I don't know if you remember this, but do you remember Doge last year when Doge heated up? I want you to remember this. I want you to look back at the date of that.

Look at it like a Doge chart. I'll pull it up right here. I'll throw a screenshot in here.

I wish I can, I guess I can do this on, let me go here, Doge. You see how crazy Doge heated up originally? It was like, oh, it was like kind of holding steady, holding steady, and then like January hit and it popped.

And then February happened and March happened and kind of plateaued, then it really popped in April. And then it was like, oh, let's take a quick dip. And then at the end of April into May, it was like, let me take a huge jump.

I'm gonna pull it up right here. And for a frame of reference, look at it, look at it exactly like this. It's pretty incredible to be honest.

Oh yes, perfect, stay right there. Just like that, mister. All right, fuck, I moved it around.

Wait, come over here. Perfect, all right, great. Look at, this is Doge.

And I talk about Doge because it's another meme coin, I guess, and you can classify us as that. But take, I'm gonna post this in announcements so it doesn't get like pushed to the side on this. This is the same exact date on right now, the announcement page.

You see what that price is right now, 0.0032. It's December 4th, 2020. Fast forward to January. You see what that is at right there?

I'll even, I'll just, you can just go on Google and post the link. It's just type in Doge chart. I posted it in announcements.

I haven't gotten any reactions on it yet. And I'm getting upset about it. But if you see that, you're looking at it, we're at 0.001 right now. They're at 0.0032. And by the time it hit January, January, it was at 0.04, you know what I mean? So like it was at 4 cents, already tremendous. Then it hit 7 cents in February.

Then it kind of stuck around that 6 to 7 cents mark. Then by the time April happened, this shit was at almost 40 cents. Then as we know, it went all the way up to over 70 cents.

This was over some fricking meme, a dog, a dog. There was no, there was nobody before saying, oh, Dogecoin, before this coin happened. Nobody fricking knew about it.

We have people in Australia that have been saying, let's go, Brandon. And the thing, let's go, Brandon is gonna keep occurring. As long as the guy with the big chair, Mr. Biden, is screwing up like he does, this thing is going to be very, very relevant. Very relevant. So if you see Biden poop his pants on Air Force One, oh, it's let's go, Brandon. Or if you see AOC going up there saying, let's tax people 82%, then they're gonna be like, oh shit, let's go, Brandon.

There's so many cause and effects, so many cause and effects. Let's see what this is saying. Exactly, AOC, big clown.

I'm just reading some of this stuff. Yeah, I obviously know that the reason that Doge went crazy is because of Elon Musk. But do you see how much it started pumping already and how much it started going?

And if you look at the chart and the overlay of that chart, I think there's a lot more fanatics of the Republican Party, of Donald Trump, of DeSantis, than Elon Musk. Yeah, Elon Musk is like a cult following, but we don't have a bunch of Cornell students here with a cult following of Elon Musk. Donald Trump had 74 plus million, and that plus is emphasized, people that voted.

Plus, get 1% of that 740,000 holders. We have 6.5,000 holders, 6.5,000. You know what I mean?

That's absolutely, absolutely crazy. Couldn't be more excited for this coin. I couldn't be more excited for this community.

All I'm asking for, just give it some time and I can assure you, cause it's gonna go one of two ways. It's not like the thing's pending. It's all set in stone.

It's either you're gonna get out now and say, you know what, I can't take this anymore. I'm looking at it too much and be so upset. You know what I mean?

And be like, oh, I'm getting out. I can't take it. I'm too scared.

I'm too fearful that this coin's gonna go somewhere. I'm afraid of a rug pull, which obviously can't happen. Then what are you afraid of?

You know what I mean? If you're already here and you've been here, why not wait it out? Like it makes, that just doesn't make sense to me because I'm telling you that we have news coming.

Why don't you at least wait for the news to come? Like in my head, that's just what I think. And you'll be a lot more excited.

You know what I mean? And that's all I'm really gonna say tonight. I love you guys.

You can hate me. You can yell at me. You can be upset with me.

Realistically, this coin is very young and we got a fricking ways to go. And this is not going anywhere. This coin is not gonna go absolutely anywhere.

I can assure you, you guys are gonna be fucking excited for all of this. I love you guys. I'm very appreciative of you guys.

And I couldn't be more proud and more honored to be up here speaking to you every night. Let's get this thing fucking cranking. I know we're dipping.

That's okay. I wish you could see how low stress I am, I guess, if that makes sense. Somebody give me a blood pressure test because I'll be fricking what?

Like 110 over 80. I'll be cool as a cucumber. I'll be calm as shit.

You know what I mean? Couldn't be worried. Couldn't be less worried.

Got this thing. I'm very confident. Very, very fucking confident.

Let's keep this thing rolling. I'll be in the general chat. I'll be talking.

I'll be chit-chatting, not on like the gen voice. I'll be chit-chatting. I'll be typing.

I'll be saying hello. Take it easy tonight. Crack a beer maybe.

Watch the games, relax. Don't look at the one minute chart. If you're in this thing and you believe this thing and you believe in me, take a break.

It's gonna be all right. I can assure you that. Busch lattes for everybody.

Right, Scott Stocks? Busch lattes for everybody. We're all right.

I promise you we're all right. Have I ever not come through on something? If I've said something before over the past 40 days, have I ever not come through?

Pretty damn excited that I have. And this is the big whatever it is. This is the big grand salami.

You know what I mean? Have a good one tonight. Be safe.

Don't go too crazy. Don't do anything that we wouldn't do. And let's keep this thing going.

Tell one new person about FJB. Love you guys.
