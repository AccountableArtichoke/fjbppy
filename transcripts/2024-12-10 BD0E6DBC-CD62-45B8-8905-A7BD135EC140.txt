Hello, happy Tuesday. Hope everybody's doing well. I don't have an update yet. 

I am still waiting on Maureen and Steve. I will update you guys as soon as I have an update. I know I'm getting a ton of DMs. 

There is...I haven't responded to any DMs. There is no inside information. There is no information more than I've given you all that I've shared with anybody. 

So anybody buying, anybody selling PPY, that's on completely on their own accord. Again, I've literally not responded to DMs for that reason. I will let you guys know as soon as I have an update.

(0:45 - 0:56)
Still here, still going. Yeah, that's really all I have. I thank you guys for your patience.

(0:56 - 1:26)
I am waiting just like you are. The latest update was this morning. That's...unfortunately, I wish I had more, but that's where we're at right now. 

I can't wait to have an update for you as soon as I get that update, as soon as I have the okay to share it. We will go ahead and do that. So just a waiting game. 

We've done several of these before. I don't like waiting. It is...trust me, it's worse for me than it is for you.

(1:27 - 1:57)
So I just wanted to pop on, say that. That's literally all the update I have or lack of update I have. Yeah, I'll let you guys know as soon as we have an update. 

I can't wait. I'm looking forward to it. You guys have a great week. 

Again, I will jump on and make an announcement as soon as I have an update for you. But for now, that's where we're at. I hope you all have a great week.
