(0:00 - 0:06)
That'd be right. I actually changed out the earphones. Okay, well, trying the recording again.

(0:07 - 0:34)
Uh, happy Tuesday. That sounded like a fall. Wow, that would be mean. 

That's not good. Then I'll be like breaking, uh, what was it, my shoulder or elbow, whatever, that was happening, the portobello. Um, all right, yeah, uh, hope everybody had a wonderful weekend.

(0:35 - 7:20)
I took, what was it, Sunday? I think the rest of Sunday to rest. Oh my gosh, it's a long day. Um, even with a short flight, uh, I managed to reach out to everybody from Vegas, made some great connections there. 

Um, probably the biggest one was actually husband and wife. Team with a product, uh, that they're very excited to get onto our app. It would be the perfect fit, not only for any crypto based community, really, um, but just our model of being able to pay for anything anonymously with what their product is. 

It's, it's really, I think, uh, so far the most perfect fit as a vendor for apps. They're very excited about that. Uh, can't wait to show you what that's all about. 

Uh, our call that we were waiting, that I was waiting on for 24 to 48 hours from the Apple partner. So not Apple, but it's a verification partner. Um, unfortunately the person who helped me on Friday, I think it was, was less than competent because my called in, um, after 48 hours to get an update, a nice lady informed me that actually he, uh, did not do what he was supposed to do. 

So she did, um, take the correct steps. Um, and to be fair, he was just following what Apple, uh, included in their email of the steps, basically because we are changing LLCs. They wanted us, Apple wanted us to create a new LLC. 

Um, however, the lady I spoke to today, a new account for the LLC, I should say for the new LLC, uh, the lady I spoke today said that does not work that way. And so, um, spent another, I think it was like 28 minutes on the phone for her to get that out. And, uh, I'm confident that she is, um, but I'm confident that she did the right thing. 

Cause she sent like seven. That's weird. Oh, why did I drop? I don't know. 

Is it just discord or telegram? Hello. Okay. So where did I lose you guys? Uh, it's really strange. 

Why find my neighborhood? Okay. So, uh, yeah, for the LLC, uh, she informed me that, um, actually they did the wrong. So Apple, it wasn't the guy's fault. 

It was Apple's fault actually. Cause their email instructions were to create a new account for this, uh, LLC. And that is not, um, correct. 

I guess this verification system, they want this, uh, number to stay with you forever. So since we rebranded from freedom jobs, business to Patriot pay, even though it's a different LLC, they want us, um, that, that number sticks with you forever, no matter what else changes, uh, owner changes, address changes, anything like that. Uh, so I am confident that she did the right thing because, um, actually we spent about the same amount of time as I did with the other guy, but she did send me exactly seven confirmation emails. 

Um, so I am confident in what she did. Um, and now I'm just waiting on the verification call. So I will let you guys know, um, she said it can take up to, I think it was, let me read the email to confirm on that, but she says generally it happens sooner. 

I don't remember if she said two weeks or four weeks. Um, but that's where we're at as far as that goes. And that's just so people on the app store can search us using Patriot pay. 

Um, I'm sure you all have seen, uh, our app in the apple app store has already changed or in the, on apple devices, excuse me, has changed. Um, so we're good there. Um, let's see, as far as our devs that were supposed to be, they had promised me originally Monday, um, they informed me, uh, yesterday, very early morning, um, that they think it's a change now issue. 

Um, they are in a chat with change now to figure that out now. Um, however, we do have, devs to back that up as far as our, uh, partner or old partners that we're having some issues with. Um, our attorney is dealing with that and, uh, we, we will be able to move on. 

Um, sorry about that. And, uh, we will be able to move on without them. I will keep you guys updated on that. 

Um, so, and, uh, yeah, I think that's all I have to say about that. I haven't really received any questions minus, uh, the usual, you know, adding, importing PQI. Um, a lot of questions or quite a few questions regarding some outsiders, um, spreading some false news.

(7:21 - 9:43)
Um, I think what's, what's important there, and, uh, I think we're always going to have people trying to bring us down and trying to find, uh, you know, things to point out, things wrong or things we're doing wrong. I think, uh, what's important to keep in mind there is with everything we've gone through, we're still here. Um, this, you know, when, when we found out of all the missing funds, uh, we sat down and talked about it and it's like, all right, how do we close shop? How do we end this? And, um, my number one thing to the team was honestly, I think we can rebuild because we have a community like no other. 

Um, so I would keep that in mind with anybody. And coincidentally, none of these people even hold anymore. Um, so it's just comical, but we continue to prove them wrong. 

And, um, again, I think a big part of that is not sure, uh, you know, you could be a realist and I consider myself a realist, but even realists are generally optimistic or pessimistic. And, um, I don't think being a pessimist really helps anything at all. Um, no matter, you know, all the things that we have been accused of, even if something were to go wrong, even if we've had, you know, devs leave or devs disappear, something happened to them or partners, um, leave or anything like that doesn't matter. 

We're going to get through it. So for, uh, those, you know, few who are, seem to be getting to some of you, um, and enough just for you guys to ask about it. I think that's something to keep in mind is, um, everything anybody is pointing out as far as, Oh, you guys are doing this wrong. 

Are you doing this wrong? It's like any business we're going to go to. We're not perfect. Um, we're doing something that's never been done before. 

Um, and that includes that even includes things like, uh, Apple or Google. I think after COVID, there's just a lot of incompetency in general, to be honest. Um, with the, with the quality of employees in general, in most places, um, you know, if this is something we had done before, we would have known when Apple, when the Apple employees said, Hey, you need to make a new account through this verification system.

(9:43 - 11:32)
We would have known to say, no, actually, you know, we can, uh, we actually don't need to do that. We need to, you know, update the information on the current record with freedom, jobs, business, et cetera, stuff like that. But again, um, this stuff we have never done before. 

And in a lot of times is things where we're, that have never done before across the board, um, that our devs are doing, uh, prime example being, uh, some major, uh, functions of our contract. Um, we, you know, who are devs, uh, created from scratch that took a lot of trial and error. And of course, with a blockchain constantly evolving and with software constantly evolving and different chains constantly evolving, there's just so many factors. 

And those are only the things we can share with you. Even there's of course, a lot of things we can share with you on the backend, um, and, and changes and, you know, things constantly happening across the board. So I think that's good to keep in mind. 

I understand, uh, obviously, um, especially if you are a realist and you do have a ton of money, um, that you purchased coins with, um, that it is good, especially, uh, after what we've been through with, uh, the missing funds and all that to, uh, verify. But I think it's also good to keep in mind that, uh, there are people out there just going out of their way to try to point anything out that we're doing wrong. And I think, uh, again, it's good to, uh, keep that in mind. 

Yeah. Yeah, sure. There will be things that go wrong and still we will get through them. 

So, you know, uh, cry harder, I guess. I don't know. I don't know what to tell everyone there, but I do appreciate the, um, questions because I'm always here to answer what I can and what I can share.

(11:33 - 12:03)
Um, um, how's it going with the smart wallet coins? Um, again, we can, who's gonna buy Apple with me? Wow. Um, smart wallet coins, we have not airdropped to you guys. We don't want to airdrop to you guys until we have, uh, that all figured out and fixed.

(12:04 - 12:26)
We just don't want to airdrop it to a wallet that's been not usable. So I hope that makes sense. Um, can you just make the Apple app button on the website not clickable and mark it Android app? Uh, yes, but we need our smart wallet, uh, fixed.

(12:31 - 14:21)
Um, let me check on that. Uh, I will, I will answer DMs right after, but if you want to quickly do it, YouTube, just search PatriotPay or even Google PatriotPay YouTube or Rumble and, uh, the videos to import PPY are right there. Um, long explanation. 

No, I've just been getting a lot of, uh, questions I'd rather answer on a voice chat instead of taking the time to answer so many people constantly. Uh, no, I did not actually. CHV is, uh, okay. 

It's between 14 business days and 30 business days and they actually even put, uh, 14 business days is Monday, April 1st and 30 business days is Tuesday, April 23rd. So, uh, between April 1st and April 23rd is when they should have their part, but she did say, um, a lot of times it is sooner than that. So we'll keep you all updated.

(14:22 - 16:05)
Um, just need to have access to the dashboard. When request changes have been resolved, please allow up to 24 to 48 hours for your updates to be fully generated in our system global. Okay. 

Yeah, she was very nice. Uh, no, the devs did not say how long because, um, how many partners are not helping? Oh, just one. Okay.

(16:05 - 16:55)
Okay. Nothing here. Uh, we are estimating, and again, take this with a grain of salt because you guys know how software development works, but with a partner we're working with, we are estimating end of quarter three for our own on-ramper. 

I will keep you updated on that. Why are you eating chips? I'm having corned beef and cabbage for dinner. And carrots.

(16:57 - 17:26)
And I made gluten-free soda bread. Yeah, so a few DMs. It's funny, sometimes I feel like the same kind of DMs come in in one batch.

(17:27 - 17:56)
If you have an app account and you don't have funds into that account, and you can't get into it, you should make a new one. If it were me, I would just wait until the app is fully launched and we have our new login and wallet creation system integrated. Because we really can't use it right now anyway, so yeah, that's what I would do.

(18:10 - 19:14)
Exchange rate for PPY on change now seems crazy high right now. I haven't checked. I'm not going to lie, I miss buying. 

I miss that too. Can you tell us more about our own on-ramper? Yes, we are just, and as we continue to make our app as self-sufficient as possible, and we'll continue doing so because we do imagine that... Shoot, my Wi-Fi again. What is going on? No, it's just Telegram. 

My Wi-Fi seems connected. It's so odd. Let me see.

(19:16 - 20:06)
Yeah, everything else is fine. My neighborhood has been having major Wi-Fi issues for months. Hello? Hello? Sorry, I don't know why my Wi-Fi is having trouble. 

Actually, I do now. It's my neighborhood, like, since December has been having crazy Wi-Fi issues. We're cocks.

(20:08 - 20:34)
Can you all hear me? Let me make sure your Discord muted me again. No? Sorry, I don't know what's up with my Wi-Fi. I hear somebody, but I don't see anybody.

(20:35 - 20:52)
Everybody should be muted. Yeah, sorry about that. But yes, our own on-ramper, again, is we will continue to make our app as self-sufficient as possible because you just never know.

(20:52 - 21:13)
We know companies get bought and sold and, you know, acquired anyway. And change owner and change hands and maybe change policies. And who knows, maybe we get larger and, you know, somebody freaks out like they did at Wire.

(21:15 - 21:29)
That's so weird. Who am I here? Oh, I see. So, yeah, that's where our own on-ramper comes up.

(22:13 - 22:42)
How about SDV? Coming by for five minutes to make sure we are on track and are golden in all these ways. Isn't he the owner calling the shots? He will come on as soon as he is able. Is own on-ramp owned by this LLC or the integration? I don't think that's been discussed yet, but I will keep you updated.

(22:49 - 23:07)
So now you're saying 2024, third quarter for our own on-ramper. Yes, that's very early discussions and that's the timeline we've been given. I will update you as we get updates.

(23:09 - 23:29)
And again, many, many factors there. So we'll see how that goes, but we will continue to be as self-sufficient as possible, which is great. That's really the goal.

(23:36 - 24:14)
Are we still looking okay for a March app launch? We should have everything wrapped up from our first quarter. The last, I think the number one thing we'll be waiting on is the app auth change. Yeah, I can't say too much about that, but that's basically smart wallet, but everything else, everything that we have more control of.

(24:14 - 24:28)
If only I knew how to be a dev, I think I can get that done too in time. An alternative to Vess was found and tested. Yeah, that's complete.

(24:32 - 24:41)
Absolutely. Wonderful. I'm sure everybody will love it.

(25:26 - 25:52)
Inserted DMs. Get those inserted as soon as I get on. So is this a yes or a no? That is, I will keep you updated.

(25:52 - 26:18)
Right now we should have plenty of time, but again, it's hard when you don't have everybody cooperating, especially when you've already paid them. So I will keep you guys updated. Again, they have found an alternative, but the devs can only do so much.

(26:27 - 26:58)
What else? What else have you guys been up to? I'm really trying to make it before March 27th, but I don't know if we'll have time to actually sign up for this event. Like the app would need to be ready before we pay and sign up, but that would be awesome. If not, their next one, I think was in April.

(26:58 - 27:12)
Let me see. It was Jake. Next one after that is April 3rd.

(27:12 - 27:33)
Then we have April 25th and May 7th. Those are awesome, very targeted opportunities that I think will be here. These are all TPSC events.

(28:06 - 28:59)
I should have taken a video actually at the conference this weekend. One guy was a software developer and he was on stage and his talk was regarding, I forget actually what his talk was going on, but one of the things was that they all, oh, I know what it was. It was on integrity and honesty and how sometimes running a business, you have to do things that are right even though it's hard and even when you don't want to, to keep people's trust.

(29:00 - 29:31)
One of the things, because he was in software development, was software changes a lot and there's problems you run into that you had no idea you would and timelines change and costs out of the estimates change. It's difficult because they have to then explain that to their clients. After he was done, I'm like, oh, I should have recorded that.

(29:31 - 30:09)
See, it's not just us. But that's why a lot of times with things like this is because devs are trying to solve an issue, but they're trying to solve something. They have no idea what the problem is and there's so many components tied into the app from ChangeNow, from our onRamper, from our office service, from Vest, from the smart wallet contract, from Freedom Factory, changing the agent.

(30:09 - 30:24)
Sometimes when Bella was around, he just used to periodically fix that or change that and just start a new one. Just so many components, even though it seems so simple on the front end. I know it's super frustrating.

(30:27 - 30:48)
How long have devs been working on the smart wallet? It has been weeks or months. Oh, boy, I've lost count. But our last deployed and completed update and tested and ready for you all, the most current one is the one with our new onRamper.

(30:52 - 31:11)
Before that, was it our office service? Our new app, login, and wallet creation service, I believe. Before that was the PatriotPay integration with the Polygon. So those are all the ones that are ready.

(31:13 - 31:27)
Minus some smart wallet issues with that first one. No, the robot did not recommend Freedom Factory. That was a Velo idea.

(31:27 - 32:01)
By the way, Velo comes from developer. Was there something that changed on the app yesterday? People were talking about it. Possibly, the devs could have possibly deployed something, even if it wasn't supposed to be deployed, if that makes sense.

(32:39 - 32:48)
Oh, let's see what we have there. Installing and testing. Oh, by the way, we've just seen several of you claims, actually.

(32:48 - 33:11)
I'll do that. Let's see. My battery died, and apparently my car went into transfer mode, I think it's called.

(33:13 - 33:39)
Has anybody else dealt with this? Super annoying. Apparently, an uncommon function of my car's make. And it just shuts so many of the functions off, even though you can drive it.

(33:39 - 34:14)
So now, second mechanics, hoping to reset the computer on that. Where does the app pull coin data pricing from? BitQuery. Oh, are you familiar with that? No, it's a BMW, but I'm sure probably other cars have the same function.

(34:15 - 34:37)
I don't know, I've never had this issue before, and I've had a lot of dead batteries. Apparently, the purpose of it is that when cars are being shipped, that if the battery dies, it stops everything from going on, like your alarm and all these things, like the AC. So it'll blow air, but not cold air, my AC won't light up.

(34:39 - 34:50)
Super annoying. And it's already super hot here, so we have a little bit of a situation. Well, at least my battery's under warranty.

(34:54 - 35:28)
But what you have to do, well, at least for my car, is you... Ugh, my internet again, are you serious? What is going on? This recording's gonna be so weird. I apologize in advance. I don't know why I'm reading these for the first time.

(35:29 - 36:40)
Steve retired living in Delaware. I'm just waiting for this Wi-Fi to get back on. Back.

(36:42 - 37:18)
Sorry about my Wi-Fi going nuts apparently today. Have you probably disconnected the battery for 30 minutes? No, I've not, but that's exactly what I did. So BMW instructs you to take out the battery, remove the plus, remove the minus.

(37:21 - 37:41)
Cross your battery wires and leave it for at least 10 minutes. So I tried 10 minutes, that didn't work, so what I did was just leave it at my mechanics, crossed, and then I'll go back tonight and put the battery in there and hopefully it resets the computer. Otherwise I have to go to the dealership and apparently they can reset it.

(37:41 - 37:57)
I tried resetting it with his computer, but it did not work. So hopefully it'll have the card and screen. Okay.

(37:58 - 38:07)
Let's see. Email. I apologize for all the questions I had.

(38:11 - 38:24)
Sorry about my crappy connection. My neighborhood's been adding, like, I don't know what it's called, some fiber something. I'm sure one of you guys know what I'm talking about.

(38:24 - 38:45)
So apparently that's why we're all dealing with issues while they add that. But I think that's everything. If you all need anything in the meantime, feel free to reach out.

(38:45 - 38:57)
Please do not share your seed phrase or click on any weird links. None of us will call you, neither me or any admins or any devs or anybody. Not Steve, not anyone of course.

(38:58 - 39:23)
I will keep you all updated if I hear anything before Friday for sure. I am actually in talks right now with another dev to come on. The Smart Wallet is such an awesome feature, but it's not the easiest to work with.

(39:23 - 39:39)
So if anybody you know is an expert in React and Web3, feel free to reach out. They can work specifically on the Smart Wallet. They have enough work for them there.

(39:43 - 40:01)
Yeah, I think also one of our devs is, like, his family member is in the hospital and our other dev, like, you know, life. So I will keep you all updated on that. But again, everything else in our quarter one should be all good by the first quarter.

(40:01 - 40:13)
And I'm excited about that. Our education segments, I think I'm going to do a poll on those actually. On the education segments.

(40:13 - 40:28)
So maybe after we already, like, have them, we'll make a poll with the same, like, the two styles we're thinking about and see which you all prefer. But again, it's kind of not geared towards you all. It's geared, like, towards our parents and grandparents.

(40:29 - 40:49)
So that might be different too. Um. That's weird.

(40:50 - 40:57)
Did the devs bring his arm again? I did not ask. Something in the hospital. But I think it's for his family member, not him.

(41:02 - 41:29)
We will not be using a third party Smart Wallet because the one that comes with one of our partners doesn't work on as many networks that we need it to work on. So I'm sure, probably right by the time we're done, they will be. But again, trying to remain as self-sufficient as possible.

(41:30 - 42:05)
But with the partners we have, they don't have all the capabilities that we need. And if it does continue, excuse me, if it does continue taking very, very long to figure out the Smart Wallet issue, what we'll do is just offer the Expert Wallet while the devs continue working on that to get it wrapped up and start working. Okay.

(42:08 - 42:28)
I think... I think that's everything we've got. Hmm. Yeah, I don't think that's everything.

(42:36 - 42:50)
What is the next task that will be completed? There's several. I think that'll all wrap up at the same time. Pretty sure.

(42:51 - 43:28)
Which is everything in wrapping up quarter one. Have you considered a bounty program to incentivize devs to get shit done? If somebody can find me, our dev, Noman, I will pay you... I'll pay you $1,000. I'm not joking.

(43:37 - 43:50)
Define find... Contact. Successfully get in contact with Noman. Because I really think he may have maybe passed away, but I'm hoping that's not the case.

(43:54 - 44:37)
Because it's weird, he was very doxed. He had been at several... He was on several dev websites, and all those profiles, I'd been stalking them during the year he was gone, and they were just inactive for that long, and then once it hit exactly a year, those profiles were wiped by the service, because they were inactive for a year. I did try... I thought I had found him, because I found his birthday, and I found a phone number of somebody I contacted, but he was like an angry old man, apparently with just the same name, I don't know.

(44:38 - 44:49)
But he was not very nice, and he kept telling me I was a scammer. But yeah, I will. Somebody can find Noman.

(44:51 - 45:09)
He was a smart wallet expert. He definitely got that quick, and did it well. It says Noman.

(45:09 - 45:23)
I don't know who Noman is. Noman, you can clone him, probably. I've got devs, they're super high-end right now.

(45:23 - 45:53)
It's just hard, because we need somebody that specializes in React, so we've interviewed a ton of devs, not just last week, I think two weeks before specifically. It will be increasingly during the past few months, but those two weeks, we had so many interviews, and it's just hard, because of course a lot of them do want work, but we also don't want anybody that's not qualified. Like, hey, you know, you can learn with us.

(45:56 - 46:38)
We need somebody who's interested and competent to work on the smart wallet. Oh, I don't hear about that. I actually have been meaning to look at crypto conferences to send some of our team to.

(46:41 - 47:01)
But yeah, if you guys ever see things, conferences, conventions that you think would be useful to us, definitely send them over. This last one was awesome, too. Definitely a lot different than CPAC was, because it was all pretty much business owners, but that's great, because that's a lot of opportunity there, too.

(47:03 - 47:19)
Definitely, I think definitely got us at least one sender for the app. Several more that we're interested, too, but this one, the most solid by far. Okay, I think that's everything.

(47:23 - 47:39)
I've just got to work on, let's see, work on prizes tonight. Probably start another contest for Friday. The merch store.

(47:40 - 47:48)
A few of you have been asking about that. Got to do some accounting stuff. Bookkeeping, I guess.

(47:52 - 48:20)
Taxes. Yeah, I think a few things tonight, but I'm here, so let me know if you need anything. I can reach out. 

I know I've been quiet in the chats, but I've been very busy in team chats, so I think that just gets it all out of me. But yeah, I'll get this recording up here. Actually, I'll probably do it before I get up.

(48:21 - 48:46)
I almost always forget when I go to repost. Who was the winner selected from the competition tonight? Oh, we can do that. Let's see, how many people are there? We can enter it into a... Actually, I'll update you on that as soon as it's done.

(48:48 - 49:05)
Oh yeah, apparently Rumble has requested to acquire and operate TikTok within the US. I wonder how that's going to go. Let's see, how many shares do we have? Okay, we have 14 shares.

(49:10 - 49:40)
Okay, so we have 21. I guess let's, here, let's put in two, and then we'll just see if the one that it picks is one of you guys. One through... What was it? 21.

(49:41 - 49:46)
January. 13. Okay, so I'm going to go and turn the list.

(49:47 - 49:57)
Hopefully it's one of you, otherwise we'll just have it pick again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13. Let's see, let me count again real quick.

(49:58 - 50:07)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13. 13. Is Daisy Kate winning? Hey, I know who that is.

(50:08 - 50:12)
Okay. Okay. Let me screenshot.

(50:15 - 50:48)
Oh, I guess I have two screenshots, because I have the one from my post. Back to me. Can't screenshot my Instagram anymore, because after I started following you, it brought you to the top of the list.

(50:49 - 51:22)
So that's not going to be, but I'll add this screenshot. I follow everybody else, though. Let's go and find the contest and add it here.

(51:34 - 51:36)
Perfect. Oh, there you go. Thank you.

Oh, my gosh. My Wi-Fi out again. Boy, that's a record.

You all have a great night. We'll talk soon.
