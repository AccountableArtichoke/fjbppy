# FJBPPY: Archive and Analysis of FJB Coin, Let's Go Brandon Coin, Freedom Jobs Business Coin, and Patriot Pay Coin

This repository serves as a growing archive and analysis hub for FJB Coin (also known as Let's Go Brandon Coin, Freedom Jobs Business Coin, or Patriot Pay Coin). We collect, organize, and examine publicly available information on these cryptocurrencies, associated organizations (e.g., Let's Go Brandon Coin LLC, Patriot Pay LLC, Warroom LLC), and key stakeholders (e.g., Stephen Bannon, Boris Epshteyn, Grant Tragni, Sarah Abdul). Community-driven and transparent, this repo aims to provide insights into the history, operations, and controversies surrounding FJB Coin and related projects, spanning from the project's inception in October 2021 through ownership changes, donations, exchange listings, voice updates, and the 2026 class-action lawsuit.

## About the Project

FJB Coin, short for "Freedom Jobs Business Coin" (commonly referred to as Let's Go Brandon Coin or Patriot Pay Coin), emerged as a cryptocurrency tied to political themes, including anti-Biden sentiments and MAGA-aligned initiatives. This repo aggregates timelines, transcripts, legal documents, publications, and analyses to help users understand the project's evolution—from its disputed founding date in October 2021 (with references to dates like 10-15, 10-21, 10-23, or 10-25), through voice updates on Discord, charitable donations (e.g., to Wounded Warrior Project, Helicopters for Heroes, Semper Fi), exchange listings (e.g., ProBit, WhiteBit, XT, LBank, CoinGecko), ownership transfer to figures like Stephen Bannon and Boris Epshteyn on December 2, 2021, to ongoing developments like the Patriot Pay app and the 2026 federal lawsuit alleging securities fraud.

Our goal is to:
- **Collect**: Gather scattered public data on FJB Coin, Let's Go Brandon Coin, Freedom Jobs Business Coin, and Patriot Pay Coin.
- **Organize**: Structure information chronologically and thematically (e.g., ownership changes, donations, exchange listings, voice updates).
- **Analyze**: Provide community-sourced insights into financial aspects, stakeholder roles, and potential risks.

This is not financial advice—it's a resource for researchers, investors, and the public interested in cryptocurrency transparency, meme coins, and political tokens like FJB Coin.
